I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death. Something about that doesn’t feel right to me.\\nDoctor Strange: We have to run.\\nChristine Palmer: Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!\\nDr. West: Organ harvesting. He’s a donor.\\nChristine Palmer: Slow down. I did not agree to that.\\nDr. West: I don’t need you to. We’ve already called brain death.\\nDoctor Strange: Prematurely. We need to get him prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.\\nDr. West: I’m not going to let you operate on a dead man.\\nDoctor Strange: [Holds up the scan of the patient\\'s brain.] What do you see?\\nDr. West: A bullet?\\nDoctor Strange: A perfect bullet. It’s been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony. A toxic metal. And it\\'s leaking directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.\\nDr. West: Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown. \\nChristine Palmer: We need to go.\\noctober Strange: The patient’s not dead, but he’s dying.

What you needed was a competent one.\\nChristine Palmer: Well, all the more reason you should be my neurosurgeon on call. You could make such a difference.\\nDr. Stephen Strange: I can’t work in your butcher shop.\\nChristine Palmer: [slightly offended] Hey! Look, he…\\nDoctor Strange: Look, I’m fusing transected spinal cords. I\\'m stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system. The work I\\'m doing is gonna save thousands for years to come. In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.\\nChristine Palmer: Yeah, you’re right. In the ER, you’re only saving lives. There’s no fame, there’s no CNN interviews… Well, I guess I’ll have to stick with Nick.\\nDoctor Strange: Wait a minute. You’re not…you guys aren’t…\\nChristine Palmer: What?\\nDoctor Strange: Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.\\nCrhstine Palmer: Explicit, actually. And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.\\nDoctor Strange: Oh really?\\n[They come to a stop outside of Christine\\'s post.]\\nChristine Palmer: I call it the Strange policy.\\nDoctor Strange: Oh, good! I’m glad something is named after me. You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure, and yet, somehow, no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.\\nChristine Palmer: We invented that technique.\\nDoctor Strange: You know, I gotta say, I’m very flattered by your policy. Look, I’m talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.\\nChristine Palmer: Another speaking engagement? So romantic.\\nDoctor Strange: You used to love going to those things with me. We had fun together.\\nChristine Palmer: No. You had fun. They weren’t about us, they were about you.\\nDoctor Strange: Not only about me.\\nChristine Palmer: Stephen. Everything is about you.\\nDoctor Strange: Maybe we can hyphenate.
