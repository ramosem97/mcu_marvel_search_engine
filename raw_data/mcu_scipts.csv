[1989 – Hank Pym enters a SHIELD facility and storms S.H.I.E.L.D's board room in the Triskelion]
Dr. Hank Pym: Stark.
Mitchell Carson: He doesn’t seem happy.
Howard Stark: Hello, Hank. You’re supposed to be in Moscow.
Dr. Hank Pym: I took a detour. [he places a vial containing a red serum on the table] Through your defense lab.
Peggy Carter: Tell me that isn’t what I think it is.
Dr. Hank Pym: It depends, if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.
Mitchell Carson: You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you’re a soldier…
Dr. Hank Pym: I’m a scientist.
Howard Stark: Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?
Mitchell Carson: If only you’d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, god. [suddenly Pym slams down Carson’s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away]
Peggy Carter: Easy, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: You mention my wife again and I’ll show you ferocity. [Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose]
Howard Stark: Don’t look at me, you said it.
Dr. Hank Pym: I formally tender my resignation.
Howard Stark: We don’t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don’t let your past determine the future.
Dr. Hank Pym: As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [Pym turns around and leaves calmly]
Mitchell Carson: We shouldn’t let him leave the building.
Peggy Carter: You’ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?
Mitchell Carson: Yes! Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work.
Howard Stark: He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it’s like when you can’t see him coming? I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he’s no security risk. Unless we make him one.


[Music plays as MARVEL appears on the screen]
[Present Day – Scott Lang is in prison getting punched in the face by another prisoner, Peachy]
Peachy: You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along]
    [Scott tries to hit Peachy in the stomach but he doesn’t flinch]
Scott Lang: You didn’t even move.
Peachy: Nah.
Scott Lang: I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here… [suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face]
Peachy: I’m gonna miss you, Scott.
Scott Lang: I’m gonna miss you too, Peachy. [they shake hands] Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. [Scott says goodbye to the other inmates]
[Scott is escorted out of the prison and is met by his friend Luis]
Luis: Scotty! What’s up, man! Damn!
Scott Lang: Hey! Hey, man.
    [they embrace each other]
Luis: Hey, what’s up with your eye?
Scott Lang: Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy. His going away present.
Luis: Oh, yeah, I still got my scar from a year ago.
Scott Lang: Oh yeah.
Luis: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I’m still the only one to knock him out.
Scott Lang: Well, I definitely didn’t.
    [they get into Luis’s truck and drive off]
[as Luis drives him home]
Scott Lang: Thanks for picking me up, brother.
Luis: Oh, you know, you think I’m gonna miss my cellie getting out?
Scott Lang: Hey, how’s your girl, man?
Luis: Uh, she left me.
Scott Lang: Oh.
Luis: Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van!
Scott Lang: It’s nice!
Luis: Yeah, right?
Scott Lang: Thanks for the hook-up too. I needed a place to stay.
Luis: You wait ‘til you see this couch, you’re gonna be really happy. You’re gonna be on your feet in no time, watch.
Scott Lang: I hope so.
Luis: Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people, some really skilled people.
Scott Lang: Not interested.
Luis: Yeah right!
Scott Lang: No, I’m serious, man. I’m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of.
Luis: You know that jobs don’t come easy for ex-cons, right?
Scott Lang: Look man, I got a masters in electrical engineering, alright? I’m gonna be fine.
[we see Scott working at Baskin Robbins]
Scott Lang: Welcome to Baskin Robbins. Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?
Ice Cream Store Customer: Uh, no thanks. Um, I will have… I’ll have a burger, please.
Scott Lang: Oh, we don’t… we don’t make that.
Ice Cream Store Customer: Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard… in mustard dip?
Scott Lang: It’s ice cream. Baskin Robbins.
Ice Cream Store Customer: I’ll just do with whatever’s hot and fresh.
Scott Lang: Dude.
[Scott’s boss, Dale interrupts him serving the idiot customer]
Dale: Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.
Scott Lang: Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh… [points to the customer] …take care of this idiot? Thanks.
[Scott enters Dale’s office]
Scott Lang: Hiya, Dale.
Dale: Come on in. Pull up some chair.
    [Scott sits down]
Dale: Three years in San Quentin, huh?
Scott Lang: You found out.
Dale: Baskin Robbins always finds out.
Scott Lang: Look, I’m sorry, alright, but I… no one would hire me.
Dale: Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.
Scott Lang: Look, I’m… I’m sorry, I… you know, it was… I don’t do it anymore. I’m just trying…
Dale: Respect. I couldn’t be happier about it.
Scott Lang: Really?
Dale: Yeah, yeah.
Scott Lang: Oh, thank you, thank you.
Dale: You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I’m like, “Wow, I know this guy? I’m in charge of this guy?” Yeesh!
Scott Lang: Well, I’m very happy in this job, and I’m… I really just appreciate the opportunities and…
Dale: Yeah, yeah. Well, you’re fired of course. I mean, I can’t really keep you on.
Scott Lang: Wait, what? Fired?
Dale: Yeah.
Scott Lang: Dale, look, it wasn’t a violent crime, I mean, I’m a good worker.
Dale: No, it wasn’t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I’ll tell you what, though, this’d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh… if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.
[after getting fired from Baskin Robbins, Scott returns to the Luis’s apartment]
Luis: Hey, Scotty, what’s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work?
Scott Lang: I was, I got fired.
Luis: Damn! They find out who you are?
Scott Lang: Yep.
Luis: Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.
Dave: Baskin Robbins don’t play.
Luis: You want some waffles?
Scott Lang: Yeah, I’ll take a waffle.
Luis: Oh. That’s Kurt. He was in Folsom for 5 years, he’s a wizard on that laptop.
Kurt: Nice to meet you.
Scott Lang: Yeah, nice to meet you too. [to Dave] And who are you?
Dave: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.
Kurt: Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.
Scott Lang: Well, technically, I didn’t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I’m a cat burglar.
Dave: You mean you’re a pussy?
Scott Lang: Yeah.
Luis: They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.
Dave: Posts all the bank records online.
Luis: And he drove dude’s Bentley into a swimming pool.
Scott Lang: What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life’s story to these guys? What do you want?
Luis: Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.
Scott Lang: No way.
Luis: No, no, no. Wait! This guy… this guy fits your M.O.
Scott Lang: No! I’m finished man. I’m not going back to jail.
Luis: It’s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute, It’s a perfect Scott Lang mark.
Scott Lang: I don’t care. I’m out.
[Pym drives up to Pym Technologies]

Pym Tech Gate Guard: Dr. Pym?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I’m still alive.
  [the guard smiles and lets Pym drive through the gate, Pym then enters the building]
Pym Tech Security Guard: I.D.
Dr. Hank Pym: [referring to the massive painting of Pym in his younger days hanging behind the guard] Perhaps that will suffice.
Pym Tech Security Guard: I’m very sorry, sir. Please come in.
Pym Tech Employee: Is that Hank Pym?
Hope van Dyne: Good morning, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope. Would it kill you to call me dad?
Hope van Dyne: Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us today.
Darren Cross: More like, thrilled.
[Cross walks over to Pym and shakes his hand]
Dr. Hank Pym: I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What’s the occasion?
Darren Cross: Oh, you’ll see. Won’t he, Hope?
[Hope gives Pym a cold look]
Hope van Dyne: We’re ready for you inside.
[Hope walks away]
Darren Cross: Ouch. [referring to Hope] I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don’t worry, she’s in good hands. You’re in for a treat.
[Carson comes over to Pym as they are about to enter the lab]
Carson: Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How’s retirement? [they shake hands]
Dr. Hank Pym: How’s your face?
[Carson enters the lab]
Hope van Dyne: After you.
[Pym enters the lab]
Darren Cross: Now before we start I’d like to introduce a very special guest, this company’s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. [everyone in the lab claps, at the same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo Cross Technologies on it] When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank’s research, I couldn’t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. [he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage] An “Ant-Man”. [pointing to Pym] That’s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?
Dr. Hank Pym: Just a tall tale.
Darren Cross: Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real? [Cross leads everyone into another room] Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it’s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it: the Yellowjacket. [he shows them a yellow insect sized suit] The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage. [he puts on a video]
Video Voice Over: We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It’s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel. The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape, completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include: surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket.
Frank: So it’s a suit.
Darren Cross: Don’t be crude, Frank. It’s not a suit, it’s a… it’s a vessel. What’s a matter, you’re not impressed?
Frank: Oh, I’m impressed. I’m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.
Darren Cross: We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?
Hope van Dyne: Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.
Darren Cross: You seem a bit shocked.
[as everyone leaves the room Pym walks over to Cross]
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, there’s a reason that I buried these secrets.
Darren Cross: So you finally admit it. We could’ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That’s why you’re the past and I’m the future.
Dr. Hank Pym: Don’t do this.
Mitchell Carson: Dr. Cross. [Cross goes over to Carson] You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.
Darren Cross: Deal.
Hope van Dyne: [after everyone leaves Cross’ presentation Hope goes over to Pym] We have to make our move, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: How close is he?
Hope van Dyne: He still can’t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.
Dr. Hank Pym: No.
Hope van Dyne: I have Cross’ complete trust.
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s too dangerous.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have a choice.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well, that’s not entirely true.
Hope van Dyne: I think I found a guy.
Dr. Hank Pym: Who?

[Scott shows up at his daughter’s birthday party]

Cassie Lang: Daddy!
[she rushes towards Scott, he catches Cassie in his arms and embraces her]
Scott Lang: Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I’m so sorry I’m late, I didn’t know what time your party started.
Cassie Lang: It was on the invitation!
[Scott’s ex-wife’s fiancé Paxton interrupts them]
Paxton: He didn’t get an invitation! But he came anyway.
Scott Lang: Well, I’m not going to miss my little girl’s birthday party.
Cassie Lang: I’m gonna go tell mommy you’re here.
Scott Lang: Oh, you don’t…
[Cassie turns and runs off]
Paxton: What are you doing here, Lang? You haven’t paid a dime in child support. You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.
Scott Lang: It’s good to see you too, Paxton.
[Cassie comes back]
Cassie Lang: Mommy’s so happy you’re here, she choked on her drink.
Scott Lang: Hey, look what I have for you.
[he hands her the small bag he’d brought]
Cassie Lang: Can I open it now?
Paxton: Of course sweetheart, it’s your birthday.
[she takes out an ugly looking rabbit which talks]
Hideous Rabbit: You’re my bestest friend!
Paxton: [referring to the toy rabbit] What is that thing?
Cassie Lang: He’s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends?
Paxton: Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.
[Cassie runs off with the ugly rabbit to show her friends]
Hideous Rabbit: You’re my bestest friend!
Scott Lang: Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It’s just hard finding a job when you have a record.
Paxton: I’m sure you’ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.
Scott Lang: No, wait, it’s my daughter’s birthday!
Paxton: It’s my house!
Scott Lang: So what, it’s my kid!
[Maggie walks over to them]
Maggie Lang: Scott! You can’t just show up here, you know that. Come on.
Scott Lang: It’s her birthday party.
Maggie Lang: Yeah, I know, but you can’t just show up.
Scott Lang: She’s my daughter.
Paxton: You don’t know the first thing about being a father.
Scott Lang: Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fiancé is an ass-hat.
Maggie Lang: He’s not an ass-hat.
Paxton: Hey, watch your language. Okay?
Scott Lang: Oh, what language. I said hat.
[Maggie takes Scott out of the house]
Scott Lang: Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?
Maggie Lang: At least he’s not a crook.
Scott Lang: I’m trying, okay? I’ve changed, and I’m straight, I had a job, and… I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I’ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?
Maggie Lang: Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You’re her hero, Scott. Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.
[Scott gets into Luis’s van, Cassie waves goodbye to him as he drives off honking the musical horn]

[Frank is in the bathroom taking a leak]

Darren Cross: I’m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.
[Frank turns back in surprise to find Cross standing there watching him]
Frank: Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can’t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?
[he chuckles as he washes his hands]
Frank: But there are laws.
Darren Cross: What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man, and I’ve transcended the laws of nature.
Frank: Darren, I don’t think you understand…
[suddenly Cross uses a small device on Frank which vaporizes him into a blob of goo]
Darren Cross: Hm. We still haven’t worked out all the bugs.
[Cross uses a tissue to wipe the goo off the sink and dumps it into one of the toilets]
Darren Cross: Goodbye, Frank.
[he flushes the toilet and washes his hands]

[Cross and Hope are having dinner at a restaurant]

Darren Cross: You know I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.
Hope van Dyne: How’s that?
Darren Cross: Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could’ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn’t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It’s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn’t he? But we shouldn’t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.
Hope van Dyne: You’re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.

[after sitting outside in the van trying to figure how many days he’s got left to see Cassie again, Scott returns to Luis’s apartment]

Luis: Hey, what’s up, hotshot?
[Scott doesn’t reply]
Dave: Maybe he didn’t hear you.
Luis: How was the party?
[Scott goes to the fridge, takes out a beer bottle and takes a swig from it]
Scott Lang: Tell me about that tip.
Luis: What?
Scott Lang: I want to know about that tip.
Luis: Ooh, baby, it’s on!
Dave: Hot dog!
Luis: It’s so on right now!
Dave: Look who grew a pair!
Scott Lang: Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it’s gotta be airtight.
Luis: Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don’t love reds man, you know? But there was a rosé that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.
Scott Lang: It’s the wrong details. It’s wrong… It has nothing to do with the story. Go!
Luis: So, uh, he tells me that she’s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she’s dating this dude Carlos who’s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she’s cleaning for. Right? That he’s, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he’s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: “Yo, man. This guy’s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin’.” Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I’ve got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: “Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: “Nah, dog. All she said is that it’s, like, super legit, and whatever’s in it has gotta be good!
Scott Lang: What?
Kurt: Old man have safe.
Luis: And he’s gone for a week.
Scott Lang: Alright. There’s an old man, he’s got a safe, and he’s gone for a week. Let’s just work with that.
Luis: Y’know what I’m sayin’?

[we see the group getting prepared and gathering the right gear for the robbery]

Kurt: Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.
Luis: All check.
Kurt: Check.
Dave: Check.
Luis: If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?
Scott Lang: Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen. [Scott leaves the van]
Luis: I love it when he gets cocky. [as they guys stay in the van they watch Scott hop the fence into the house]
Dave: Damn! [through his earpiece] Alarm is dead.
Luis: Nice!
Scott Lang: Alright, I’m moving through the house.
[inside the house Scott finds a door with a thumbprint scanner]
Scott Lang: There’s a fingerprint lock on the door.
Luis: It’s got a what? Ernesto didn’t tell me nothin’ about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?
Scott Lang: Not necessarily.
[Scott quickly uses several household items to get a fingerprint from a door knob and uses that to successfully pass the thumbprint scanner]
Scott Lang: I’m in.
Kurt: No alarms have been triggered. He’s in like the Flynn.
[Scott opens the door and immediately sees the safe made of strong metal]
Scott Lang: Oh, man.
Luis: What is it?
Scott Lang: Well they weren’t kidding, this safe is serious.
Luis: How serious we talkin’, Scotty?
Scott Lang: It’s a Carbondale. It’s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.
Luis: Wow. Can you crack it?
Scott Lang: Well, here’s the thing. It doesn’t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?
Luis: Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.
Dave: It killed everybody.
Kurt: But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.
[Scott gets to work to try and open the safe]
Luis: What are you doing?
Scott Lang: I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn’t.
Luis: What are you doing now?
Scott Lang: Waiting. Waiting.
[the safe door breaks open]
Scott: Nice.
[Scott looks inside the safe]
Luis: What is it, cash? Jewels?
Scott Lang: Well there’s nothing here.
Luis: What’d you say?
[Scott notices some blueprints and the original Ant-Man suit]
Scott Lang: It’s a suit.
Luis: What?
Scott Lang: It’s an old motorcycle suit.
Luis: There’s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?
Scott Lang: No. It’s a bust.
Luis: I’m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.
[we see an ant with a camera on its back nearby recording Scott take the suit, inside his lab Hank is watching Scott]

[back at Pym Technologies Cross is about to perform the shrinking experiments with a lamb]

Hope van Dyne: I thought we were using mice?
Darren Cross: What’s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.
Hope van Dyne: Darren, maybe we should think…
Darren Cross: Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can’t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.
[Cross initiates the experiment and the lamb is vaporized to goo to Hope’s shock]
Darren Cross: Experiment 34C results: Negative. [to the lab tech] Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35C.

[back at Luis’s apartment in the bathroom, Scott looks at the suit he took from the safe]

Scott Lang: Why would you lock this up?
[he takes out the suit and looks at the helmet]
Scott Lang: So weird.
[he tries the suit on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror]
Luis: Scott, what’s up man?
[Scott closes the shower curtain then looks at the buttons on the gloves]
Scott Lang: I wonder… what is this?
[he presses the buttons and shrinks down to a tiny size]
[in his tiny form Scott stand and looks around him in shock, Scott then hears Hank’s voice speaking through the mask]
Dr. Hank Pym: The world sure seems different from down here, doesn’t it, Scott?
Scott Lang: What? Who… who said that?
[Scott sees Luis open the shower curtains to take a shower]
Scott Lang: Luis! Luis, down here!
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.
[Luis turns on the water, after getting splashed around Scott falls out of the bathtub and onto the floor]
Dr. Hank Pym: Guess you’re tougher than you thought.
[Scott hears Luis about to get undressed]
Scott Lang: Oh, I don’t want to see this.
[as Luis drops his trousers onto the floor it knocks Scott through a hole in the apartment below]
Scott Lang: Luis! Ahh! Son of a… !
[Scott falls into an apartment where a party is going on, he narrowly avoids getting stepped on before falling through the vent into another apartment gets sucked into a hoover, breaks out, encounters a mouse, then runs into a trap and is launched out the window where he returns to his normal size on top of a cab]
Cab Driver: What the hell?
Dr. Hank Pym: Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I’ll be in touch.
Scott Lang: No, no. No, thank you.

[Scott packs the suit up and sneaks it back into house and returns it into the safe, but the police are waiting for him as he goes to leave]

Cop on Speaker: Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!
Scott Lang: No, I didn’t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.
[Scott realizes he’s admitted to stealing and reluctantly kneels on the ground as he’s arrested]

[Paxton visits Scott as he’s sat in his cell]

Paxton: You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It’s gonna break their hearts.
Detective: You got a visitor.
Scott Lang: Who?
Detective: Your lawyer.
Scott Lang: My lawyer?
[Scott is taken to a room where Pym is sat waiting for him]
Dr. Hank Pym: I told you I’d be in touch, Scott. I’m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.
Scott Lang: Oh, man.
Dr. Hank Pym: Sit down.
[we see ants crawling over the camera in the room to obscure the conversation]
Scott Lang: Sir, I’m sorry I stole the suit. I don’t even want to know why you have it.
Dr. Hank Pym: Maggie was right about you.
Scott Lang: How do you know about… ?
Dr. Hank Pym: The way she’s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.
Scott Lang: I don’t understand.
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I don’t expect you to. But you don’t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?
Scott Lang: What?

[flashback to Pym giving money to his housekeeper, Emily, so that she can tip Luis’s friends to tip off about the job]

Dr. Hank Pym: Second chances don’t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.
[Pym rises and leaves the room]
Maggie Lang: [referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie to sleep] Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?
Maggie Lang: Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?
Cassie Lang: No, I love this one.
Maggie Lang: Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you. [Maggie kisses Cassie on her head]
Cassie Lang: Mommy?
Maggie Lang: Hm?
Cassie Lang: Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he’s bad.
Maggie Lang: No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?

[as Scott is sat in his cell thinking several ants bring Scott the suit in its tiny form then enlarge it so that Scott can wear it, he quickly slip into it, zaps himself small to escape]

Dr. Hank Pym: Smart choice. You actually listened for once.
[Scott runs out of the cell]
Dr. Hank Pym: Under the door.
[as the prison alarm goes off Scott runs out of the building]
Scott Lang: Okay. Where to now?
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang tight.
[some ants approach Scott]
Scott Lang: What? What?!

[inside the police station]

Paxton: Where the hell did he go?
Detective: I have no idea, he just vanished. [into his radio] Set up a five block perimeter, now!
[back to Scott; to the ants]
Scott Lang: Get back, get back, get back!
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, these are my associates.
Scott Lang: Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where’s the car?
Dr. Hank Pym: No car, we’ve got wings. Incoming!
[a large winged ant flies over Scott and lands in front of him]
Dr. Hank Pym: Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.
Scott Lang: Are you ki… ? How safe’s this… ?
Dr. Hank Pym: Get on the damn ant, Scott!
[Scott gets on the ant and as it flies off the police go on a manhunt for him]
[the winged ant has landed on a police car that’s looking for Scott]
Scott Lang: Why am I on a police car? Shouldn’t I not be on a police car?
Dr. Hank Pym: So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.
Scott Lang: Whoa. Alright. Now, what’s the next move?
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on tight.
Scott Lang: Oh, this is easy. I’m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It’s like a horse.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re throwing 2-47 off balance.
Scott Lang: Wait, his name is 2-47?
Dr. Hank Pym: He doesn’t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?
[as the police car swerves]
Scott Lang: Whoa!
Dr. Hank Pym: Maybe it’s 2-48.
[as the ant flies up]
Scott Lang: No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I think it’s 2-47.
Scott Lang: Wait.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on.
Scott Lang: I think I’m getting the hang of this.
[as ant flies Scott around the city]
Dr. Hank Pym: I’m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.
Scott Lang: What? Can I make one little request?
Dr. Hank Pym: No.
Scott Lang: Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.
Scott Lang: Just set her down, alright? I’m getting light headed.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on, Scott.
Scott Lang: Yeah, I’m getting a little light… it’s funny… hit me, and…
[as the ant continues to fly Scott feels dizzy and falls off the ant’s back]

[Scott wakes up in a bedroom and jumps up in shock when he sees Hope watching over him]

Scott Lang: Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?
Hope van Dyne: Yes.
Scott Lang: Why?
Hope van Dyne: Because the last time you were here you stole something.
Scott Lang: Oh. Oh! Hey, look.
[Scott goes to get out of bed but recoils when he sees insects crawling all over the floor]
Scott Lang: Whoa!
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They’re here to keep an eye on you when I can’t. Dr. Pym’s waiting for you downstairs.
[she turns and walks out of the room]
Scott Lang: Who? [calling out to Hope] Hey, um, whose pajamas are these? [gets no response] How am I supposed to do this?
[Scott puts his foot down tentatively onto the floor and the ants make space for his foot]
Scott Lang: Right, just one step at a time.
[he slowly stops towards the door as the ants make room for his feet]
Scott Lang: Ugh. You don’t bite me, I don’t step on you, deal?
[in the dining hall]
Hope van Dyne: Take down the servers and Cross wouldn’t even know it. We don’t need this guy. [Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat]
Dr. Hank Pym: I assume that you’ve already met my daughter Hope.
Scott Lang: I did. She’s great.
Dr. Hank Pym: She doesn’t think that we need you.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t. We can do this ourselves.
Dr. Hank Pym: I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.
Hope van Dyne: Okay, we can try this and when he fails I’ll do it myself.
Dr. Hank Pym: She’s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you’re sitting opposite me, I take it that you’re interested in.
Scott Lang: What job?
Dr. Hank Pym: Would you like some tea?
Scott Lang: Uh, sure. [Pym pours Scott some tea]
Dr. Hank Pym: I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.
Scott Lang: Were you watching me?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I’ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp. [Scott see Hope smile to herself] Vista’s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It’s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?
Scott Lang: Yeah, thanks. [he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table towards his cup] You know what, I’m okay. [referring to the ants] How do you make them do that?
Dr. Hank Pym: Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.
Scott Lang: Right. But how do you make them do that? [he sees the ants returning the sugar cubes into their bowl]
Dr. Hank Pym: I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.
Hope van Dyne: And still know absolutely nothing. I’m late to meet Cross. [Hope gets up and leaves] [Scott raises his hand to ask a question]
Scott Lang: Uh… Dr. Pym?
Dr. Hank Pym: You don’t need to raise your hand, Scott.
Scott Lang: Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell’s going on and can I go back to jail now?
Dr. Hank Pym: Come with me. [Pym takes Scott to his lab] Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.
Scott Lang: Huh?
Dr. Hank Pym: I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that’s what powers the suit, that’s why it works. [they enter Pym’s lab]
Scott Lang: Whoa.
Dr. Hank Pym: But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that’s when I switched gears and I started my own company.
Scott Lang: Pym Tech.
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.
Scott Lang: Darren Cross. He’s a big deal.
Dr. Hank Pym: But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn’t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn’t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.
Scott Lang: How could he do that?
Dr. Hank Pym: The board’s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn’t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain’s chemistry. I don’t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he’s not the most stable guy to begin with.
Scott Lang: So, what do you want from me?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?
Scott Lang: I do.
Dr. Hank Pym: If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?
Scott Lang: Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?
Dr. Hank Pym: I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. [Paxton receives a text from his partner, Gale, as he’s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie]
Maggie Lang: You going to be home for dinner tonight? [Paxton reads the text, “Lang’s “Lawyer” is Dr. Hank Pym, as in Pym Tech]
Paxton: Uh, yeah. I’ll pick something up, text you.
Maggie Lang: Okay. Good news? [Paxton gets up to leave]
Paxton: Uh, I don’t know. It’s news.
Cassie Lang: Are you trying to find my daddy?
Paxton: Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.
Cassie Lang: Hope you don’t catch him. [Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he used to worked with]
Dr. Hank Pym: This isn’t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That’s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.
Scott Lang: I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.
Dr. Hank Pym: I’ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I’m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they’re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.
Scott Lang: Okay, then why don’t you just send the ants?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that’s designed to prevent infiltration.
Scott Lang: Hank, I’m a thief. Alright? I’m a good thief. But this is insane. [just then Hope enters the lab]
Hope van Dyne: He’s right Hank and you know it. You’ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I’m wearing the suit.
Dr. Hank Pym: Absolutely not!
Hope van Dyne: I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.
Dr. Hank Pym: We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have time to screw around.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope, please. Listen to me, please…
Hope van Dyne: He is a criminal. I’m your daughter.
Dr. Hank Pym: No! [Pym turns and sits down, Hope walks off in disappointment]
Scott Lang: She’s right, Hank. I’m not your guy. Why don’t you wear the suit?
Dr. Hank Pym: You think I don’t want to? I can’t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You’re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it’s just disappointment. It’s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter’s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It’s not about saving our world, it’s about saving theirs.
Scott Lang: Damn, that was a good speech.

Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.

[we see Scott wearing the Ant-Man suit with Pym and Hope training him]

Dr. Hank Pym: In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs. [Hope closes the door] Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. [Scott puts on the helmet and charges for the keyhole]
Scott Lang: Ow! [we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive through the keyhole] Ah! Ow.
Hope van Dyne: [to Pym] Useless.

[Hope trains Scott]

Hope van Dyne: When you’re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you’re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it’s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.
Scott Lang: I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.
Hope van Dyne: Show me. [she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand] Terrible.
Scott Lang: You want to show me how to punch? [he puts up his hand like hers] Show me… [suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back]
Hope van Dyne: That’s how you punch.
Dr. Hank Pym: She’s been looking forward to this.
Scott Lang: No kiddin’.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.
Hope van Dyne: Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.
Dr. Hank Pym: We lost her in a plane crash.
Hope van Dyne: It’s bad enough you won’t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We’re working here. [as Scott is still recovering from her punch] Alright princess, let’s get back to work.
Scott Lang: Were you going for the hand?

[Pym finds Scott playing around with the suit’s regulator]

Scott Lang: You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.
Dr. Hank Pym: Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.
Scott Lang: What does that mean?
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a quantum realm.
Scott Lang: What does *that* mean?
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.
Scott Lang: Cool. Yeah. I’m… if it ain’t broke.

[return to training]

Dr. Hank Pym: You’ve learned about the suit, but you’ve yet to learn about your greatest allies: the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.

[Pym and Hope watch as Scott shrinks in their back garden and goes running under the earth]

Hope van Dyne: Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they’re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. [Scott comes across a crazy ant]
Scott Lang: Oh, you’re not so crazy. [the crazy ant jumps on him, knocking Scott back] Hey! You’re cute. [suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott] Oh! Aaah! [Scott turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground] That was a lot scarier a second ago.

[as they look at Pym Technologies building map]

Scott Lang: It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.
Hope van Dyne: There’s a security guard posted around the clock, we’ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.

[shrunk again and back under the earth, Scott goes looking for more ants]

Scott Lang: Okay. Who’s next? [a massive ant comes up behind Scott]
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata.
Scott Lang: I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index. [to the ants] Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom? [as the ant goes to attack Scott pops back up the through the ground in his normal size] Whoa!

[return to the Pym Technologies building map]

Hope van Dyne: The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.
Scott Lang: Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?
Hope van Dyne: The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.

[return to training]

Hope van Dyne: [looking at another ant] Camponotus pennsylvanicus.
Dr. Hank Pym: Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.
Scott Lang: Wait a minute, I know this guy. I’m going to call him Ant-thony.
Dr. Hank Pym: That’s good. That’s very good, because this time you’re really going to have to learn how to control him. [we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table] Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.

[we see Hope and Scott fight training, this time Scott lands a painful blow to Hope]

Scott Lang: Oh, you okay, d… [Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then knocks him down with her legs]

[later as Scott is tending to his wound]

Hope van Dyne: Hank wants you outside for target practice.
Dr. Hank Pym: The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.
Hope van Dyne: [referring to another species of ant] Solenopsis mandibularis.
Dr. Hank Pym: Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.

[back to Scott trying to get some ants to put the sugar cubes into the teacup]

Dr. Hank Pym: You can do it Scott, come on. [one of the ants flies off and Scott takes off his earpiece in frustration]
Scott Lang: They’re not listening to me.
Hope van Dyne: You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.
Dr. Hank Pym: Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have time for coddling.
Dr. Hank Pym: Our focus should be on helping Scott!
Hope van Dyne: Really? Is that where our focus should be? [Hope picks up the earpiece and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup, then she gets a herd of ants to appear]
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope! [looking upset Hope walks over to Pym]
Hope van Dyne: I don’t know why I came to you in the first place. [Hope leaves]
Dr. Hank Pym: We can’t do this without her.

[as Hope is about to leave in her car Scott gets in]

Hope van Dyne: Oh, God.
Scott Lang: You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There’s some weird folks in this neighborhood.
Hope van Dyne: Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he’s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.
Scott Lang: I’m doing this for her.
Hope van Dyne: You know when my mother died I didn’t see him for two weeks?
Scott Lang: He was in grief.
Hope van Dyne: Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that’s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.
Scott Lang: He doesn’t want to shut you out. He trusts you.
Hope van Dyne: Then why are you here?
Scott Lang: It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I’m expendable, that’s why I’m here. You must’ve realized that by now. I mean, that’s why I’m in the suit and you’re not. He’d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway… [Scott goes to get out of the car]
Hope van Dyne: You know, I didn’t know you had a… a daughter when I called the cops on you. What’s her name?
Scott Lang: Cassie.
Hope van Dyne: It’s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that’s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus. [she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the ants and places a coin on the dashboard] Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. [couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin] That’s good. [they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin]

[Hope and Scott enter back into the house where Pym is waiting]

Dr. Hank Pym: Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.

[in flashback we see Pym in his Ant-Man suit and his wife in her Wasp suit intercepted the missile]

Dr. Hank Pym: I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn’t hesitate.

[we see Janet shrinking herself to stop the missile]

Dr. Hank Pym: Janet! No!

[flash-forward]

Dr. Hank Pym: She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.
Hope van Dyne: You were trying to bring her back.
Dr. Hank Pym: But all I learned was we know nothing.
Hope van Dyne: It’s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn’t you tell me this sooner?
Dr. Hank Pym: I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn’t mean to lose you too. [Hope begins to cry]
Hope van Dyne: I’m sorry.
Scott Lang: This is awesome. It’s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you’re healing. It’s important. [Hope and Pym turn to look at him] I ruined the moment didn’t I?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes, you did, yes.
Scott Lang: I’m gonna make some tea. [Scott turns and leaves]

[we see Scott finally shrink down and dive through the keyhole]

Scott Lang: Nailed it!

[he then goes under the earth, gets to fly on an ant]

Scott Lang: That’s a good boy, Ant-thony.

[we see him successfully work with the ants getting them to follow him]

Scott Lang: The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.

[we see Scott in his shrunken form on the side of a plane]

Scott Lang: It’s freezing! You couldn’t make a suit with a flannel lining?

[back in Pym’s lab]

Dr. Hank Pym: We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it’s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.
Hope van Dyne: We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark’s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.

[back to plane]

Scott Lang: You’re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.

[back on the plane Scott instructs the ants]

Scott Lang: Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don’t drop me this time. [they jump off the plane] Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.
Dr. Hank Pym: Stay calm.
Scott Lang: [approaching the ""old Stark warehouse"" he's supposed to burglarize] Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn’t you say this was some old warehouse? [The ""warehouse"" comes into clearer view, with a large circle-A insignia on the roof denoting its role as the Avengers' base] It’s not! [we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base] You son of a bitch!
Hope van Dyne: Scott, get out of there.
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort! Abort now.
Scott Lang: No, it’s okay. It doesn’t look like anyone’s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.
Dr. Hank Pym: He’s gonna lose the suit.
Hope van Dyne: He’s gonna lose his life.

[Scott lands in the roof of the new Avengers base]

Scott Lang: Alright I’m on the roof of the target building.
Hope van Dyne: Somebody’s home, Scott. [just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in]
Natasha Romanoff: [on Sam’s radio] What’s going on down there, Sam?
Scott Lang: It’s the Falcon!
Sam Wilson: [into his radio] I had a sensor trip but I’m not seeing anything. Wait a second.
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort, Scott! Abort now.
Scott Lang: It’s okay, he can’t see me.
Sam Wilson: I can see you.
Scott Lang: He can see me. [Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to Falcon] Hi. I’m Scott.

[to Pym back in the lab as they listen to Scott]

Hope van Dyne: Did he just say “Hi I’m Scott?”

[back to Avengers HQ]

Sam Wilson: What are you doing here?
Scott Lang: First off, I’m a big fan.
Sam Wilson: Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?
Scott Lang: I’m Ant-Man. [Sam smiles] Ant-Man?
Scott Lang: What, you haven’t heard of me? No, you wouldn’t have heard of me.
Sam Wilson: You want to tell me what you want?
Scott Lang: I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.
Sam Wilson: I know exactly how that is. [into his radio] Located the breach. Bringing him in.
Scott Lang: Sorry about this! [just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself, hits Sam and runs off]
Dr. Hank Pym: What the hell are you doing? [Sam chases after Scott]
Sam Wilson: Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech. [Sam flies in and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam]
Scot Lang: Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry [Scott jumps around Sam while punching him]
Sam Wilson: That’s enough! [Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him]
Scott Lang: Ant-thony, a little help. [Ant-thony flies in, Scott jump on his back and they fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him]
Dr. Hank Pym: I’ve lost visual! [suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors]
Sam Wilson: He’s inside my pack.
Scott Lang: Sorry. You seem like a really great guy. [they fight but Scott gets manages to disable Sam’s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony; into his radio]
Sam Wilson: It’s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.

[back to Pym house]

Dr. Hank Pym: That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! [Scott takes Pym’s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table]
Hope van Dyne: You got it. [Scott nods his head]
Dr. Hank Pym: Well done.
Scott Lang: Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn’t he?
Hope van Dyne: Kind of sounded like he did.
Dr. Hank Pym: I was good, wasn’t I?
Scott Lang: Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn’t die?
Dr. Hank Pym: Now let’s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. [Pym turns and leaves with the signal decoy]
Hope van Dyne: Don’t mind him. You did good. [Pym enters his living room to find Cross standing there]
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren. How the hell did you get in here? [Pym closes the door]
Darren Cross: You left the front door open, Hank. It’s official. You’re old. [Hope and Scott hear them from the kitchen]
Hope van Dyne: The plans! He will kill him. [back with Cross and Pym]
Dr. Hank Pym: Well to what do I owe this pleasure?
Darren Cross: I have good news.
Dr. Hank Pym: Really? What’s that?
Darren Cross: Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We’re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone. [Pym says nothing, at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on the nearby table] You’re welcome. I know this is odd, but I’d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.
Dr. Hank Pym: Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.
Darren Cross: What did you see in me?
Dr. Hank Pym: I don’t know what you mean.
Darren Cross: All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?
Dr. Hank Pym: I saw myself.
Darren Cross: Then why did you push me away?
Dr. Hank Pym: Because I saw too much of myself. [Cross turns and leaves] [after Cross leaves]
Hope van Dyne: He knows, he’s baiting you! We have to call it off.
Dr. Hank Pym: We’re all taking risks.
Hope van Dyne: What if he saw me here?
Dr. Hank Pym: He didn’t. There’s no way.
Hope van Dyne: How do you know that? [just then Hope gets a call from Cross] Darren, hi.
Darren Cross: Hope, where are you right now?
Hope van Dyne: I’m at home, why?
Darren Cross: I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.
Hope van Dyne: Don’t let him rile you up, he’s just… he’s just a senile old man.
Darren Cross: We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I’m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.
Hope van Dyne: Great. Good idea.
Darren Cross: Thank you, Hope. I’m so lucky to have you on my team.
Hope van Dyne: He’s tripling security, he’s lost his mind, and he’s on to you.
Dr. Hank Pym: But he is not on to you.
Hope van Dyne: He’s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?
Scott Lang: The water main. You can’t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that’s how I get in.
Hope van Dyne: Somebody would have to reach the building’s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?
Scott Lang: So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.
Dr. Hank Pym: No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.

[Hope provides three cups of coffee for Luis, Dave and Kurt]

Luis: Thank you for the coffee ma’am. It’s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!
Hope van Dyne: [to Scott] You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?
Luis: Two smoothie machines.
Hope van Dyne: Are you sure they can handle this?
Luis: Oh we can handle it, we’re professionals.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’ll forgive us if we’re not instilled with confidence.
Dave: Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn’t we?
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you.
Dave: Well, one could say that I let you let me.
Scott Lang: Look, it’s okay. They can handle this.
Luis: Yeah, we can handle it.
Scott Lang: You got their credentials?
Hope van Dyne: He’s in the system.
Luis: I’m in the system?
Dave: The system.
Luis: The system?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yeah. We’re doomed.
Scott Lang: Alright, there’s something you guys need to see.

[a little while later, as Pym is showing Luis, Dave and Kur their plans Scott walks in wearing the Ant-Man suit]

Luis: Damn! Whoa! That’s so cool, bro!
Scott Lang: Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It’s pretty freaky but it’s safe. There’s no reason to be scared.
Luis: Aw, no, no. Daddy don’t get scared.
Scott Lang: Really?
Luis: Yeah.
Scott Lang: Good. [Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis, Dave and Kurt]
Luis: Oh!
Kurt: This is the work of the gypsies.
Dave: That’s… that’s… that’s witchcraft.
Luis: Oh, that’s amazing. That’s like some David Copperfield shit.
Dave: That’s some kind of wizardry.
Kurt: Sorcery!
Luis: Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! [runs out of the room] Get off! Get off! Ahh! [Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his shoulder]
Scott Lang: I thought daddy didn’t get scared?

[Luis, Dave and Kurt have all fallen asleep on the couch]

Hope van Dyne: I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.
Scott Lang: Hey, look. I want to thank you for…
Hope van Dyne: No, please don’t. We’re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I’m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.
Scott Lang: Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.
Hope van Dyne: You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.
Scott Lang: You really should write poetry. [Hope laughs]
Hope van Dyne: Get some sleep, Scott. [Hope leaves]

[later that night Scott uses the Ant-Man suit to go and visit his daughter in her room as she sleeps]
[outside Pym Technologies]

Scott Lang: Alright, just so we’re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?
Dave: Wheels on the ground.
Scott Lang: Kurt?
Kurt: Eyes in the sky.
Scott Lang: Luis?
Luis: Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that’s what’s up.
Scott Lang: Luis.
Luis: I’m sorry, I mean, I’m good, I’m good. I’m just excited, and plus you’re girlfriend’s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too. [to Hope] And you are very beautiful, ma’am.
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, my lord.
Scott Lang: She’s not my…
Luis: Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I’m saying? To like, blend in.
Scott Lang: No, don’t whistle. No whistling. It’s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

[on the night of the charity event, Luis makes it in employed as a security guard, outside Dave and Kurt are in their van with Scott in the back dressed in his suit]

Kurt: We’re set.
Scott Lang: Wish me luck. [Scott gets out, shrinks himself as he goes through the water main]
Kurt: Utility is online.

[inside the building Luis starts whistling]

Alpha Guard: Hey. What are you doing?
Luis: Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I’m securing.
Alpha Guard: I’m the boss.
Luis: Oh.
Alpha Guard: [into his radio] Utilities work room three… [Luis suddenly punches him, knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level]
Kurt: Water level is dropping.

[Scott floats along on the water with the ants through the pipes]

Kurt: Coming up on extraction pipe.
Scott Lang: I see it! [to the ants] Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That’s it, that’s it, guys, yeah! [the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe] That’s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on! [Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the bathroom] Alright, let’s fly Ant-thony. [Scott and the ants fly off]
Kurt: The Ant-Man is in the building.

[as they see Pym pull up outside the building where the charity event is taking place]

Dave: Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.
Kurt: This is problem?
Dave: Considering the Crown Vic’s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem. [inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale]
Paxton: That’s Pym. [they get out to go after Pym]
Kurt: Oh, no.

[back with Scott and the ants]

Scott Lang: I’m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don’t remember what it’s called but I feel bad for this guy. [using the ants Scott takes down one of the security guards with Luis also punching him]
Luis: See, that’s what I’m talkin’ bout. That’s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know? [Hope then comes along and enters the room and places the signal decoy]
Kurt: Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.
Dave: Looks like Pym’s getting arrested.
Kurt: Scott, we have problem.
Scott Lang: Problem? What’s the problem? [just then Dave gets out of the can]
Kurt: Dave! Dave, that’s not part of plan!
Dr. Hank Pym: [as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym] Listen to me, if I don’t get into this building people will die.
Gale: That’s awfully dramatic.

[Dave creates a diversion by stealing Paxton and Gale’s car]

Paxton: Are you kidding me?! [they run after Dave as he drives off in their car]
Kurt: Problem solved.

[inside the building Cross finds Hope]

Darren Cross: Well. How do I look? [they then find Pym as he enters the building] There he is. Just in time. Come on. [Cross takes them to vault where he’s keeping the Yellowjacket suit, and uses an eye scanner to open the door]
Computer: Twelve point verification.
Dr. Hank Pym: Little over the top, don’t you think, Darren?
Computer: Confirming authorization.
Darren Cross: No, you can never be too safe.
Computer: Access granted. [they enter the vault]
Dr. Hank Pym: I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.
Darren Cross: And you only know the half of it, Hank. [at the same time Carson arrives with his men]

[back to Scott and the ants]

Scott Lang: Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let’s go. [Scott and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept] Proceeding to command position. [Scott jumps off Ant-thony] I’ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I’m in position. I’m going to signal the ants. [Paxton and Gale find their car dumped can crashed into a tree]
Paxton: No, no, no, no! [Dave gets back into the van with Kurt]
Dave: Did you see that? [he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott using it earlier]

[back to Scott instructing the ants]

Scott Lang: Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let’s fry these servers. [the ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony] Let’s go get ‘em, buddy!
Kurt: Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.
Scott Lang: Headed to the particle chamber.

[Carson and his men enters the vault where Cross is with Pym and Hope]

Mitchell Carson: Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.
Darren Cross: Wonderful. [to Pym] They’re not what they were, they’re doing some interesting work. And I’m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it’s gonna blow up in your face. [suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face] Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it’d be all pathetic and weak.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well you figured wrong.

[back outside Paxton and Gale walk over to Luis’s van]

Paxton: I know this van. [he bangs on the van door] Anybody home?
Dave: [to each other inside the van] Shh.
Kurt: Shh.
Dave: Shh!
Kurt: Shh!
Scott Lang: Alright, guys, I’m here. Setting the charges. [Scott set the explosives; to the ants] Great job, guys. I’ll take it from here. [Ant-thony sets Scott down] Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. [to Kurt and Dave] Guys, how we lookin’ on that laser grid?
Kurt: Almost!
Dave: No, you’re not.
Kurt: I’m getting close!
Dave: No, you’re not. [Paxton keeps banging on Luis’s van door]
Paxton: San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you’re in there! [inside the van as they wait for the laser grid to be disabled]
Dave: Make it go faster.
Kurt: Dude, seriously!
Scott Lang: Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?
Kurt: It’s so close.
Paxton: [suddenly the van door opens, Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and Dave] Freeze!
Dave: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.
Paxton: Get out.
Dave: Take it easy!
Kurt: [Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled; to Scott] Go! Go now! [Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket] Wait!
Scott Lang: What? What do you mean wait? [Kurt manages to struggle free from Paxton’s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as Scott goes to grab the suit it’s pulled away] What? What? [Cross sees Scott and taps on the glass]
Darren Cross: Hi, little guy. [to Pym] I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? [pauses a moment] Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, don’t do this. If you sell to these men, it’s going to be chaos.
Darren Cross: I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It’s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I’ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I’m keeping the particle to myself. They don’t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you’ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?
Dr. Hank Pym: The most powerful man in the world.
Darren Cross: You proud of me yet?
Dr. Hank Pym: You can stop this, Darren. It’s not too late.
Darren Cross: It’s been too late for a long time now. [one of the men in the chamber points their gun at Pym]
Hope van Dyne: Darren, what are you doing?
Darren Cross: He wasn’t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.
Hope van Dyne: This is not who you are, it’s the particles altering your brain chemistry.
Darren Cross: [to the guy pointing a gun at Pym] Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re right, I have to be the one to do it. [he points a gun at Pym’s head, at the same time Hope takes out her weapon and points it at Cross]
Mitchell Carson: Here we go.
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun.
Darren Cross: You know I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there.
Hope van Dyne: You’re sick and I can help you just put the gun down.
Darren Cross: I wasn’t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now!
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun, now!
Darren Cross: You picked the wrong side, Hope. [just then Scott breaks out using the disc Pym gave him that turn things large, he starts fighting off the men in the chamber and Pym is shot in the chaos]
Hope van Dyne: Dad! [grabbing hold of the wounded Pym]
Scott Lang: Hank. No, no. Hank. Hank. Listen, you’re gonna be okay. Alright? You’re gonna be just fine. [Cross comes up behind Scott and points his gun at the back of Scott’s head]
Darren Cross: Take the suit off or I’ll blow your brains out and peel it off! [Scott instructs the ants to disable Cross’ gun and bite him, so he takes off and the same time Carson takes off with vial of Cross’ particles]
Paxton: [Luis sets off the alarm to the building; into his radio] We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.
Dave: [Paxton and Gale head off; to Kurt] Go, go, go! [Dave and Kurt get into the van and drive off]
Hope van Dyne: [inside the vault] Dad, can you move?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes.
Scott Lang: We need to get him out of here.
Hope van Dyne: Go get that suit. [Scott takes off and tries to get away from the two guards shooting at him]

[Scott shrinks himself into the small building model of Cross of Tech to get away from the guards shooting at him, then Luis comes to the rescue and knocks out the guards]

Luis: Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Scotty? [Scott makes himself large again]
Scott Lang: Thank you, Luis.
Luis: Hey, are we the good guys?
Scott Lang: Yeah.
Luis: We’re the good guys, right?
Scott Lang: Yeah, we’re the good guys.
Luis: Feels kind of weird, you know?
Scott Lang: Yeah, but we’re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows. [Scott shrinks himself and takes off]
Luis: [as Luis tries to leave the building he remembers the guard he knocked out earlier] Oh, dammit! That guy. [he opens the door and rushes to the guard who is tied up] Hey! We’re getting out of here! [back inside the vault Hope helps Pym sit up]
Hope van Dyne: The charges are set. We’ve got to find a way out of here and fast.
Dr. Hank Pym: Don’t worry. I’m not gonna die, and neither are you. [he holds up a keychain that looks like a tank] It’s not a keychain.

[outside]

Paxton: [into his radio] All the chaos in here! Multiple shots fired. [suddenly a tank bursts out through the building] And there’s a tank. [Luis then walks out of the building with the guard]
Luis: A little help. [someone takes hold of the guard, at the same time Hope helps Pym out of the tank] I got him. [Luis helps Pym]
Hope van Dyne: We need a doctor! [a medic comes over to help Pym]

[Cross is in his helicopter]

Darren Cross: Let’s go! [just as they are about to leave Cross sees a swarm of flung ants heading towards him with Scott on Ant-thony, Cross takes out a gun and starts shooting and one of the bullets hits Ant-thony]
Scott Lang: Ant-thony! [Scott falls onto another ant]
Darren Cross: Go! [the helicopter door is closed]
Scott Lang: You’re gonna regret that. [Cross’ helicopter takes off] [Paxton sees Luis as he gets into his van]
Paxton: Wait a minute! Get out of that van!
Luis: What?
Paxton: Get out of that van!
Luis: It’s too loud there’s a tank, I can’t hear you! [he closes the van door and Dave drives off]
Paxton: Hey! Hey! [Scott makes it into Cross’ helicopter and Cross starts shooting at him]
Darren Cross: Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?
Scott Lang: It was never just a heist! [Scott sets off charges set around Pym Technologies and Cross watches in shock as the whole building is destroyed] Put the gun down!

[Cross hits Scott and he falls out of the helicopter window back into his normal size] 
[Scott manages to get back into the helicopter but finds Cross wearing the Yellowjacket, they both shrink start fighting and fall into a briefcase which falls out of the helicopter]

Darren Cross: I’m gonna disintegrate you! [inside the briefcase they accidentally hit the cell phone]
Cell Phone: Playing “Disintegration” by The Cure. [“Disintegration” by The Cure starts playing as Scott and Cross continue to fight]]

[[Briefcase falls into a family’s pool, Scott and Cross blast out in a splash as they return to normal size]

Pool BBQ Dad: Call 911! [Scott and Cross continue to fight shrinking and growing until Scott swats Cross into a bug zapper]
Scott Lang: It’s okay. [the family runs off in fear]

[Paxton and Gale show up]

Gale: Police! Put your hands up!
Paxton: Get ‘em up! [Scott pulls up his helmet] Scott?
Scott Lang: Paxton, you have to listen to me- [as Scott goes to walk towards Paxton they taser him and falls down unconscious]

[as Paxton and Gale are driving Scott back to the police station Scott wakes up] Paxton, turn around, take me back.

Paxton: I’m taking you back, to prison.
Scott Lang: There’s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper, it…
Paxton: [Paxton suddenly stops the car and turns to Scott] You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!
Police Radio: All units we have a 236 in progress at 840 Winter Street.
Scott Lang: It’s Cassie! [Paxton takes off towards his house]

[Cross is standing in Cassie’s room looking menacing]

Darren Cross: Don’t be scared. [Paxton pulls up outside his house]
Paxton: Maggie, what’s going on?
Maggie Lang: He’s got Cassie!
Paxton: Who’s got Cassie?
Maggie Lang: That thing, that thing! I don’t know what it… ! [back in Paxton’s car, Scott manages to put on his helmet, shrinks and takes off]

[Cross starts walking towards Cassie]

Cassie Lang: Are you a monster?
Darren Cross: Do I look like a monster?
Cassie Lang: I want my daddy!
Darren Cross: I want your daddy too. [he picks up Cassie and she screams, just then Scott shows up] There you are.
Cassie Lang: Daddy, is that you? [Scott pulls up his helmet]
Scott Lang: Hi, Peanut. [to Cross] Why don’t you pick on someone your own size? [he throws a disc at Cross which shrinks him then he shrinks himself, Cross is now on the Thomas The Tank Engine toy in Cassie’s room]
Darren Cross: Now where did you go, little guy? [he spots Scott running towards him] There you are. [he starts firing lasers from his suit at Scott]
Scott Lang: Not just me. [a swarm of ants follow behind Scott] Get him! Go! Go! [Cross fights off the ants as they attack him, then Scott and Cross fight across the Thomas The Tank Engine toy]
Luis: [as they drive towards Paxton’s house] Scotty needs us, you know what I’m sayin’? Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop us. [they stop as they see a load of police cars and cops surrounding the house] Back it up. Back it up slow.
Dave: Yeah. [Dave starts to slowly back the van away]
Luis: Just back it up.
Dave: Yep, yep.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: Okay.
Luis: All we gonna do is, we ju… we just back it up.
Dave: Okay. That’s it.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: That’s right.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: Yep.
Luis: Okay, now-now-now. Just back it up.
Darren Cross: [as they continue to fight in Cassie’s room inside the Thomas The Tank Engine railway] You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me. [Cross shoots his laser at Scott as he runs around Cassie’s room] You know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger!
Scott Lang: Yeah, I agree. [Scott throws two discs at Cross, he deflects it one hitting an ant the other the Thomas The Tank Engine toy and they both grow large]
Paxton: Cassie! [Paxton runs into the house]
Darren Cross: I’m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. [Paxton goes to run up the stairs]
Paxton: Cassie, I’m coming! [suddenly the large ant heads his way, he falls down the stairs as the giant ant breaks out of the house]
Gale: That’s a messed-up looking dog.
Darren Cross: [back inside Cassie’s room; to Scott] I’m going to destroy everything you love! [Paxton shows up]
Paxton: Freeze! S.F.P.D.! [Cross throws Paxton’s gun aside, at the same time Scott climbs up the back of Cross’ suit]
Scott Lang: I can’t break through!
Darren Cross: It’s titanium, you idiot!
Scott Lang: [to Paxton as Scott and Paxton continue fighting] Get her out of here! [Paxton carries Cassie off]
Paxton: Come on.
Darren Cross: [as Paxton goes to leave the room with Cassie in his arms Cross stops them] Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help daddy pay for his mistakes.
Paxton: You stay behind me, okay?
Cassie Lang: Okay.
Paxton: Behind me. [Scott looks up at Cross’ particle pack]
Scott Lang: I’m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. [to Cross] Get away from us! Daddy, help! [Scott jumps up to head towards Cross’ particle pack] I love you, Cassie. [Scott shrinks to a small enough size to break into Cross’ particle pack, this causes Cross and Scott to go subatomic and disappear]
Cassie Lang: Daddy, where are you? [Scott floats past dust, viruses, molecules, atoms, hadrons, quarks, and finally the deepest parts of gluons and remembers Pym’s words]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Go sub-atomic… go sub-atomic… [Scott tries to grow himself back to normal size but realized he can’t]
Scott Lang: Oh, no. [he continues to float in the quantum realm]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. And as you shrink for all eternity, everything that you know and love gone forever. [Scott hears Cassie’s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm]
Cassie Lang: [voice] Daddy! Where are you? Daddy!
Scott Lang: Cassie.
Cassie Lang: [voice] Come on, daddy. [Scott remembers the discs Pym had given him and takes one out]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Do not mess with the regulator. [Scott places the disc in the regulator, presses the button and finally returns to normal size] I love you so much.
Scott Lang: I love you too, so much.
Paxton: [as Scott is holding onto Cassie Paxton mildly gets Scott’s attention] There’s a big hole in the roof.
Scott Lang: Sorry. [Gale runs up to Cassie’s room and we see Paxton holding Cassie and Scott has gone]
Gale: Is she alright?
Paxton: She’s fine. [Maggie enters the room]
Cassie Lang: Mommy. [Maggie grabs hold of Cassie with relief]
Paxton: She’s fine, she’s fine. [Cassie notices Scott in his shrunken size wave goodbye to her and leaves]

[the next day Scott is over at Pym’s house]

Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, please. You don’t remember anything?
Scott Lang: Hank, I… I don’t.
Dr. Hank Pym: There must be something else. Well I suppose the human mind just can’t comprehend the experience, but you made it. You went in and you got out, that’s amazing.
Hope van Dyne: Scott, I’ll walk you out.
Scott Lang: [to Pym] Get some rest. [Scott and Hope leave the room, Pym looks over to the photo of himself with his wife holding Hope when she was a baby]
Dr. Hank Pym: Is it possible? [Pym gets up to leave his room, as he opens the door he finds Hope and Scott kissing] When did this happen?
Hope van Dyne: Nothing’s happening.
Scott Lang: Whoa, hold on. Something’s kind of happening.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well if that’s the case… shoot me again.
Scott Lang: [looking at Hope] Yeah, I don’t know what you’re doing grabbing me and kissing me like that. I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I’ll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope. [Scott turns to leave]
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott.
Scott Lang: Yeah?
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re full of shit.
Scott Lang: Oh, yeah.

[Scott is having dinner with Paxton, Maggie, and Cassie]

Paxton: Well, Scott I met with my Captain today, he wanted a report of the night that you got out of jail. Something happened with the cameras, circuits got fried, and… But I told him you were processed correctly.
Scott Lang: Really?
Paxton: Well, yeah. Can’t be sending Cassie’s dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?
Scott Lang: Thank you, Paxton. I’m blown away. Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.
Paxton: Oh, well, that’s my pleasure. But no, no, this one, I… I did it for you.
Scott Lang: This is awkward.
Paxton: Yeah.
Cassie Lang: Yeah.
Scott Lang: I mean what do we even talk about after all of that?
Cassie Lang: Oh, I know.
Scott Lang: What?
Cassie Lang: I did my first cartwheel today.
Scott Lang: What?
Maggie Lang: Yeah. She has been practicing all week, but today was the magic day.
Paxton: I recorded it on my phone here. [Paxton shows Scott his recording of Cassie doing her first cartwheel]
Scott Lang: No, that can’t be Cassie. That’s not you.
Maggie Lang: Yeah, it is.
Cassie Lang: Yeah it is.
Scott Lang: This is a professional gymnast, there’s no way that’s you.
Paxton: Yeah, that’s her. [Cassie feeds the giant ant hiding under the table that had escaped during Scott and Cross’ fight]
Cassie Lang: Good, boy. [after watching the video of Cassie doing her cartwheel]
Scott Lang: Sweetie, that’s pretty amazing, Peanut. [just then Scott gets a call] Sorry. It’s work. [he answers the call] Yeah?

[Scott meets up with Luis, Dave and Kurt]

Scott Lang: Alright, here’s the deal. Just give me the facts.
Luis: Just the facts, only the facts.
Scott Lang: Breathe, focus, keep it simple.
Luis: No, no, no, no doubt, no doubt. Okay, so I’m at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right? And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit, but you know me, I’m more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right? But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro. Oh, my God…
Scott Lang: Luis.
Luis: Okay. Sorry, sorry. I’m ju… you know, uh, I just get excited and stuff. But anyway, anyway. When Ignacio tells me: “Yoh, I met this crazy fine writer chick at this spot last night. Like, fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.” And he goes up to the bartender and goes: “Look at the girl I’m with? You know what I’m sayin’? She’s crazy stupid fine, right?” [we see flashback to Ignacio meeting the girl and talking to the bartender who is in fact Stan Lee] And the bartender’s all like: “Yeah, crazy stupid fine.” So this writer chick tells Ignacio: “Yoh, I’m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains. You know what I’m sayin’?” Ignacio’s like: “For real? And she’s like: Yeah. You know what, I can’t tell you who my contact is, because he works with the Avengers.”
Scott Lang: Oh, no.
Luis: Yeah, and this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man. Like he comes up to her and says… [we see flashback of the girl meting up with Sam Wilson in a park] “Yoh, I’m looking for this dude who’s no one seen, who’s flashing this fresh tack, who’s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got? She’s like: “Well, we got everything nowadays, we got a guy who jumps, we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls. You gotta be more specific.” And he’s like: “I’m looking for a guy who shrinks.” And I’m like: “Damn!” [to Scott] I got all nervous cause I keep mad secrets for you, bro. So I asked Ignacio: “Did bad-ass tell the stupid fine writer chick to tell you to tell me because I’m tight with that man, that he’s looking for him?”
Scott Lang: And? What’d he say?
Luis: He said yes.

[mid-credit scene; Hank brings Hope down to his lab]

Dr. Hank Pym: There’s something I want to show you. I realized you can’t destroy power, all you can do is to make sure that it’s in the right hands. [he opens up a vault to reveal the prototype of the Wasp suit] This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together. She never got to use it, but now I realize that we were… we were working on it for you. [Hope looks at the suit in shock then back to Pym] Maybe it’s time we finished it. [Hope looks back at the suit and smiles]
Hope van Dyne: It’s about damn time.


[post-credits scene: Sam and Steve Rogers are in a garage with the Winter Soldier, his metal arm tightly clamped in a vise and a forlorn look on his face]

Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve and Sam are in an underground room with they are holding Bucky Barnes with his metal arm trapped in a vice] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony…
Sam Wilson: He won’t believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did…
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the accords will let him help?
Steve Rogers: We’re on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.

 Avengers: Infinity War
 Captain Marvel

Hank: [voiceover] I still think about the night your mother and I had to leave you...
[The camera cuts to a young Hope van Dyne, who is walking out of her bedroom into the hallway. There, Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym are talking to a woman.]
Janet: [to the woman, faintly] Hopefully, it's not for long, but I'll call you when we get settled.When I have a better indication of what's going on.
Young Hope: Mommy?
[Janet and Hank turn around to face their daughter. Janet sighs as Hank gets the bags situated.]
Janet: Oh, Jellybean. [She kneels down to meet eye-level with Hope.] Daddy and I have a last minute business trip, so Rose is going to stay with you for a few days.
Young Hope: No. I don't want you to go.
Janet: Ugh! It's gonna be so boring! I won't be able to keep my... eyes...
[Janet then pretends to have dozed off. Hope giggles as Janet snores. Hank walks up to his daughter.
Hank: Goodbye, sweetheart. Alright, we'll see you soon. [He kisses Hope on the forehead. He then touches Janet's shoulder.]
[Janet snorts ""awake."" Both girls giggle.] 
Hank: [voiceover] I wish we could have put down our bags, and tucked you back into your bed, but too many lives were at stake. 
[Cut to a shrunken Janet and Hank flying onto a metal surface, leaves flying through the air.]
Hank: Oh my god! They've already launched!
[A missile flies up from the surface.]
Janet: We have to stop it! Come on!
[Hank grapples himself up on the bomb while Janet flies. As the missile rockets through the air, Hank and Janet hang onto the steel, desperately trying to disarm the missile.]
Hank: [voiceover] The only way to disarm the missile was to get inside it, but the plating was too thick. The only way in was to shrink between the molecules. 
[Janet flies up beside Hank, putting a grapple line onto her waist.]
Janet: I can't get through! Hank...
[A landmass comes to view through the clouds, meaning the missile could wipe out that place any second.]
Hank: [voiceover] We both knew that if you go that small, there's no coming back. 
[Hank tries to turn a button on his belt, but it sparks and fails. Janet watches.]
Hank: [voiceover] It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged. Your mother's wasn't.
[Janet flies up into the air and turns a button on her belt, making the red light flash.] 
Janet: Tell Hope I love her...
Hank: [voiceover] She turned it off.
Hank: Janet, no!  
[Janet flies into the missile, and shrinks until she cannot be seen. She flies through various systems, disarming the machine and making sparks fly everywhere.]
Hank: [voiceover} And went subatomic to deactivate the bomb. 
[The rocket tumbles and splashes into the ocean.]
Hank: [voiceover] Your mother saves thousands of lives that day, knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm. Alone. Afraid. Gone forever.
[Young Hope looks back at the doorway and disrupts her playing to greet her father at the door, who looks tired and traumatized. Hope's lip quivers, and Hank pulls her in for an embrace.]
Hank: [voiceover] Telling you that she wasn't coming home, was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.
[Cut to present day, with a grown Hope and an older Hank.] But then Scott showed up...or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the Quantum Realm... he came back, everything changed. I started to wonder...could your mother still be alive? [Hank stands up, and Hope follows.] So I dusted off some old plans.
[Hank pulls a rubber band off a rolled up white piece of paper and unfolds it on the huge table. The plans are a blueprint for a ""quantum tunnel.""]
Hope: Dad, what are you saying?
Hank: I think it's possible to bring her back.
[Present Day]
Scott: Okay. We're in. [A flashlight clicks and turns on, illuminating Scott's face. He shines the light around.] Aw, this place is a maze. Where's that map? ['Scott grabs the map and shines the flashlight on it] We're definitely close. [Scott lowers the map to reveal his ten year old daughter, Cassie, is with him.] Are you ready?
Cassie: I'm ready, Daddy.
Scott: Are you sure? Cause once we're inside, you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.
Cassie: I eat fear for breakfast.
Scott: Wow. That is super cool. Come on.
[Scott and Cassie crawl through the cardboard maze; a fake ant face shows up]
Scott: Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? [There's silence. Scott sighs.] (louder) Anton, which way do we go?!
[Startled, Luis quickly gets up and runs toward the cardboard maze; he grabs two strings and pulls, making the ant's limbs point right.]
Scott: Thanks Anton!
[Luis runs back to his computer; Scott and Cassie continue through the maze]
Scott Lang: Look! The ants have burrowed into the tech facility.
Cassie Lang: Oh, no! Lasers!
[Pieces of red string appear with a red glow, making them look like real lasers. Cassie wiggles through the ""lasers"" with ease; Scott gets tangled by one]
Scott Lang: Oh! I think I got lased!
[The duo make their way through the lasers; A green, glowing ""eye scanner"" appears]
Scott Lang: The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens.
Cassie Lang: Yup! 
[Cassie puts a huge paper plate with an eye drawn on it over her face.]
Scott Lang: Perfect! Right there.
[Scott pulls a lever; the glowing disc dings. Cassie takes the lens off her face; the cardboard doors open]
Cassie Lang: There! It's the microtreasure!
[A small trophy is on a plate.]
Scott Lang: My trophy?
Cassie Lang: It looks like treasure.
Scott Lang: Oh, it is to me.
Cassie Lang: I wanna take it to show and tell.
Scott Lang: Oh, you can't do that. Can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I'm so touched you think I'm the 'World's Greatest Grandma.'""
[The camera cuts to the trophy plaque, which indeed says 'World's Greatest Grandma.']
Cassie: (giggles) It was the only one they had.
Scott: Makes me wanna knit you a sweater. 
[Luis lifts up the sheet covering the maze, laptop in hand, so he can face Scott.]
Cassie: Oh no! The fuzz! 
Luis: Hey, Scotty. I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings, and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?
Scott: No, no, not at all.
Luis: You sure? 'Cause it's a lot of security cameras. 
Scott: I know what he needs. Who's the security expert in our business? 
Luis: You are, but I'm running the company, and if we oversell it, he's gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird. 
Scott: He ain't goin' anywhere. And the expression is ""'land this fish.""
Luis: No. It's ""land the bird."" Just like you land a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. 
Scott: I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do.
Luis: How am I gonna land a fish? It can't walk. And if it swam up on a shore, and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?
Scott: You really turned me around on this thing. It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me, I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter. 
Luis: Imma go recheck it.
[Scott pulls a string, making an alarm clock ring.]
Cassie: To the escape ant. 
[A cardboard door lifts open.]
Cassie: Let's bounce before the po-po come back. 
Scott: The po-po? How do you even know that? [Scott and Cassie get on a paper-mache ant.] Let's fly Antionette. Let's fly!
[Scott pushes a stick holding the ant in place, causing it to slide down the stairs. Scott and Cassie scream and whoop as the ant slides through a cardboard slide down the stairs, through the hallway, and eventually down the porch steps into the backyard.]
Scott: Crash landing! 
[Sure enough, the ant crashes into the fence. Scott and Cassie tumble into the ground in laughter. Cassie props herself up on her elbow.]
Cassie: I wish we could shrink for real.
Scott: Oh, that is pretty cool!
[Luis sticks his head out the top window, calling out to Scott.]
Luis: Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like I'm way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff, and my hands are shaking, but I think that's unrelated, you know?
Scott: It's gonna be great, Luis. You got nothing to worry about. 
Luis: Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss... [Luis shrinks back into the house, almost trying to convince himself that it's going to be fine.]
[There's a shrill beeping.]
Cassie: [points] Daddy!
[The camera shows a black attachment outside the house beeping and blinking a red light. Scott looks at it in fear, then looks at his left foot, which is through the hole in the fence. Scott groans.]
[Cut to FBI agents looking through Scott's house. Agent Woo looks through the house, Scott and Cassie following him.] 
Scott: Come on, Woo! I got three days left. Why would I try to escape? 
Woo: I'm sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern. Soup to nuts. 
[A woman accidentally bumps the lampstand, sending a glass object to the ground. Scott looks as it shatters.]
Scott: ['sarcastically to the woman] Thank you. [to Woo] It was an accident. My foot went through the fence. 
Cassie: Our flying ant crashed.
[Woo looks at Scott in confusion and concern.]
Scott: Hey, you try entertaining a ten-year-old when you can't leave the house. You know the lengths that I've gone to? [Scott holds up his hand, and flicks it, making an Ace of Spades card appear in his hand out of thin air.] Close up magic. [He flicks the card away before putting his hand behind Cassie's ear and making another Ace of Spades return to his hand. He tosses it behind again.] I learned that. 
Cassie: Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?
[Woo looks to Scott in amusement before kneeling down to face Cassie at eye-level.]
Woo: Oh, Cassie. This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way: Your school has rules, right? Like...You can't draw on the walls. Well, your Daddy went to Germany anddrew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.[Woo is now rambling, seeming to forget a child is front of him.] Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three years of probation. and avoid any unauthorized activities, technology, or contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, in violation of said Accords, or any related statutes. [Woo looks satisfied with his answer. Cassie, however, has her eyes wide, trying to process all of the things he said.] Okay sweetie?
Scott: (sarcastically) Wow, you're really great with kids.
Woo: Thanks, I'm also a youth pastor. [Scott's face snaps from a smile to confusion.] Anyway, not to be a Johnny Ask-A-Lot, but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope van Dyne, have you?
Scott: No. 
Woo: You sure? Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And I don't need to remind you that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum. 
Scott: I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.
Cassie: They hate his guts.
Scott: Thanks, peanut. 
[Woo looks around before leaning towards Scott and lowering his voice.]
Woo: How'd you do it, Scott? 
Scott: Do what?
Woo: (slightly ashamed) The card trick.
Scott: (in slight disbelief) Seriously?
[Cut to Maggie, Scott's divorced wife, and Paxton, her current fiancee, walking up the steps to the house.]
Maggie: Oh my god! You people can't just show up here whenever you want and search the place.
Paxton: Actually they can.
Maggie: You need a warrant.
Paxton: Actually they don't.
Maggie: Really? Wow.
[Cut to Cassie leaving Scott's house, going to Maggie and Paxton's.]
Maggie: Did you pack your soccer shoes?
Cassie:  Yeah. [Cassie hugs her father]
Maggie: [walking up to Scott, embracing him and Cassie] Next time I see you,
will be on the outside!
Paxton: Oh, get on the inside of this. [Paxton wraps his arms around the hug. Maggie laughs.] Three days! Seriously? I'm proud of you, buddy. [Paxton pulls away.]
Scott: Thank you.
Paxton: You know what? Give me another one. [Paxton hugs Scott again.] 
Maggie: Me, too!
Freedom, business, I'm
sensing greatness!
Cassie: I had a fun weekend, Daddy.
Scott: Me too, Peanut.
Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta
here, we're gonna go paint this town red.
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking. [He mimics retching, then puts his hand to his mouth and makes a barfing sound, a trail of cards extending from his mouth. Cassie giggles as the cards scatter everywhere.]
Maggie: You're getting good at that.
Paxton: How'd you do that?
Cassie: Bye, Daddy!
[An exchange of bye's are said as the three get in the car. Scott uses the stair railing to lean himself out the door, ankle brace staying in the house.] 
Scott: Three days...
Easy-peasy.
[A montage starts of what Scott does to pass the time while the song ""Come On Get Happy"" by the Partridge Family plays.]
[Scott plays the toy drums.] 
[Scott has toy pins set up. He throws a ball to hit them. The ball instead bounces over the pins. He pauses, frozen in the stance.]
[Scott watches a magic trick video on Online Close-Up Magic University.] 
Man in the Video: Snap your fingers. That
gets them to look over there.
Now that is misdirection. [Scott imitates the trick shown to him, shaking the deck and snapping his fingers. making the card change to a six of hearts. He  looks at the deck with satisfaction.]
[Scott has a karaoke screen on his TV, singing along to the song playing during the montage, ""Come On Get Happy"" by The Partridge Family.]
[Scott is crying while laying on his bed reading ""The Fault In Our Stars"" by John Green.]
[Scott perfects a yellow oragami swan he's hung from the ceiling.]
[Scott bounces a racquetball on the floor, which goes onto the wall, bounces onto the other wall, bounces on the floor and goes into a Nerf basketball hoop.]
[Scott works on a layout for his business.]
[Scott gets readyi to take a bath. He takes a plastic bag and uses a rubberband to seal up the bag so it doesn't get wet. He slides himself into the bath and sighs.]
Scott: Easy-peasy...
[He dozes off. Suddenly, he is back in the quantum realm. As he floats, Janet appears with him. Then, he is taken to a hallway in a home.]
Scott: [voiceover] What?
Janet: [voiceover] I'm gonna find
you, Jellybean. [Young Hope can be heard giggling. A large, red wardrobe with horses on it comes into view. It is then opened by a hand extended into the camera's view. Hope is found inside.] I found you!
Young Hope: You always find me, Mommy.
Scott: [voiceover] What the hell?
[There's a mirror on the inside of the wardrobe. Scott looks to see that Janet is the reflection. He then snaps awake.]
[Scott breaks the wall in his room and grabs an old, outdated phone from it. He dials a number, and then puts the phone up to his ear.]

Scott: Hey, Hank.It's been a while.Umm... I don't even know
if this is your number anymore... and,
I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from. But...
I just had a really
weird dream.
And I know that doesn't sound like an
emergency or anything, but it just felt... very real.I was back in the Quantum Realm, and...
I think I saw your wife.
And then I was your wife.I mean, not in
a weird way...You know... hearing this out loud, I'm thinking, it's not an emergency.
I'm sorry to bother you.I'm sorry for
a lot of things."" [Scott pulls the phone away from his ear and hangs up. He then snaps the phone in two and throws it away to make sure they don't trace the call back.]
[Scott is sitting on the couch in his bathrobe, eating a bowl of cereal and watching TV. He takes a bite and swipes away a bug. The bug seemingly bites him, and he winces. He suddenly grows tired, and quickly passes out on the ground.]
[Scott's eyes flutter open to see that he's been put in the passengers seat of a car. He looks over and sees Hope behind the wheel
Scott: (drowsily) Hope? [She looks over at Scott before turning back to the road.] Is this another dream?
Hope: Do you think it's a dream, or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there?
Scott: I'm not sure... [He suddenly remembers where he's supposed to be; at home. HIs eyes snap open.] I can't be here! I can't be,I'm under house arrest. [Scott tries to open the doors to the car.]

Hope: They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott. [Scott yells as his passenger window is greeted with a pigeon eye. The car has shrunk down. Another car drives over it, unaware of what lurks beneath.] 
Scott: You have to take me home. They can show up any second.
Hope: Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, you're still at home.
[Scott looks down at his ankle to see that his ankle cuff has been removed.]
[Cut back to Scott's house, where an enlarged ant is sitting on the couch with a box of Froot Loops and Scott's ankle cuff on. Luis stumbles in and yells at the sight of the ant.]
Luis: Woah! Scotty?
[Cut back to Hope's car.]
Hope: He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.
Nine hours in bed, five
hours in front of the TV,
two hours in the bathroom - whatever that's about.
Scott: (defensively) That's totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me?
Hope: (with sharpness) We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right? And so far, the biggest one we've had is you.
[The car drives through a steel pipe]
Scott: I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security, that Cap needed help-
Hope: (as a scoff) Cap?
Scott: ...tain America.
Captain... Cap.
It's what we call him. (cocky and self-inflating) 
If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend,
a little. I know him. He's nice. Whatever...
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't
think I'd get caught.
Hope: You didn't think
about a lot of things.
Scott: 
How's Hank?
Hope: We're still running, the house is gone. So
is our freedom. How do you think he is?
Scott: 
I'm sorry. I know
you're mad.
Hope: I'm not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we're even talking is because we need what's in your head.
[Hope parks the car, making the car grow back to normal. Both get out of the car and walk into the building.They head towards the elevator. The lobby looks rough, as it's under construction. The two walk into an elevator, and Hope is silent throughout the whole walk.]
Scott: Is this where you're living? If you need help, money
or something, maybe I can...
Hope: We're fine.
[The elevator doors ding open, and Hope walks out. Scott realizes that Hope and Hank are fine, as the place is filled with expensive tech and equipment. Scott follows Hope and he stops as he sees Hank. Hank catches his eye before reluctantly making his way over.]
Scott: Hey, Hank. Look... I just want to- 
Hank: Save it. Can we start?
Hope: Yeah. So, while you were relaxing
at home, we were building this. It's a tunnel. To the Quantum Realm. To my Mom. We think she might still be down
there, we just don't know where.
Scott: What?
Hope: If we can pinpoint my Mom's location,
then the pod can take me down to get her.
Scott: You built all this and you
don't even know if she's alive?
Hanks: It's called a hypothesis.
Last night we powered up the tunnel for the
first time. It overloaded, and it shut down.
But for a split second,
the doorway to the
Quantum Realm was opened.
Scott: 
And?
Hank: And five minutes later, you
called. Talking about Mom.
We think when you went down there,
you may have entangled with her.
Scott: Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.
Hank: 
Quantum entanglement, Scott.
Hope: 
We think she might have put some kind of
message in your head. Hopefully, a location.
And opening the
tunnel triggered it.
Scott: 
Your Mom put a message in my
head? Come on. That's insane.
Hank: No, Scott. Insane...
is going to Germany without
telling us and fighting the Avengers.
Just tell me you weren't
lying about the suit you took.
Tell me you
really destroyed it.
Scott: I did. I destroyed it. I swear.
Hank: I can't believe you
destroyed my suit.
That was my life's work.
Scott: What was I supposed to do?
Hank: You were supposed to not take my suit!
[Hank storms off down towards the lobby, Scott and Hope follow him]
Scott: I'm sorry, Hank. I'm
sorry I took the suit.
I'm sorry that
I called last night.
I don't remember seeing Janet
down there. I wish that I did.
I just had a dream about her playing
hide and seek with a little girl.
[Hank and Hope stop walking and Hank turns to face Scott]
Hope: What?
Scott: I had a dream. She was playing
hide and seek with a little...
girl. Cassie and I do it all the
time. It doesn't mean anything.
Hope: But, was it Cassie
in the dream?
Scott: No.
Hope: Where was she hiding?
Scott [confused]: What?
Hope: The little girl, where was she
hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?
Scott: No, it's in a tall dresser.
Hank: You mean a wardrobe.
Scott: Is that what that's called?
Hope: What color was it?
Scott: Red.
[Hope and Hank exchange a look and Hank laughs under his breath]
Hope: Were there horses on it?
Scott: Oh, boy.
Hope: 
It's where I hid every
time we played.
Scott: 
Doesn't sound like you really
got the gist of the game.
Hope [to Hank]: She's alive!
Hank: I knew it.
I knew it!
Hope: We need to get that part.
Hank: Okay.
Hope and Hope walk excitedly back into the lab, followed by a confused Scott]
Hope: The sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head.
Hank: Does Burch have it?
Hope: Yeah. Let's go.
Scott [confused]: What part? Who's Burch?
Wait, what's happening?
[Hope and Hank pick up a few pieces of equipment and walk out of the building towards the car, followed by Scott]
Hope: We need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again.
I brought your clothes.
You might wanna change.
[Hope throws a full duffel bag towards Scott, which Scott catches. Hank presses a remote which shrinks the car. Hank then replaces the toy-sized car with a toy-sized ute before pressing the remote again the enlarge the ute]
Scott: Look. I'd really like
to help you out.
But if I'm not home when they come to take off
my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.
Hope: 
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel,
we'll get the message and have you home by lunch.
We have to hurry. The
entanglement won't last.
Hank: You owe us.
Scott: All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.
[Hank presses his remote again and the building shrinks down the the size of a suitcase and wheels it towards the ute, while Scott looks around confused]
Hank: Let's go.
[They pack the building into the van and drive away as a transparent figure stands to the side.]
Hope: 
We good?
Hank: Yeah.
Hope: I'll be right back.
Scott: Can I have one of those?
Hank: No.
[Hope walks through a very fancing restaraunt teeming with bodyguards. She approaches Sonny Burch at a booth.]
Sonny: Susan! Welcome to Oui!
Hope: Sonny.
Sonny: Oui is French for yes. As in, yes, we found a table ,yes, you saw us, and yes,to planet before property.
Hope: 
Well, let's hope it
also means yes to
do you have the
component I ordered?
Sonny: 
You know, I've always loved
your sense of humor, Susan. Have a seat.
Hope: No, I'm good. Thank you.
Scott: Who is this guy?
Hank: Sonny Burch.
He traffics in black
market technology.
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.
Scott: Can I just have one?
[Scott reaches for the altoid tin and Hank swats his hand.]
Hank: No.

Sonny: You know, I have a special friend, down
at the FBI. And I say special, because...
Well, he tells me things that
I didn't previously know.
For example...
Your name isn't Susan.
It's Hope Van Dyne.
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.
Scott: That's not good, Hank.
Hank: No shit.

Hope: What do you want?

Sonny: Relationships are
built on trust, Hope.
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.
Hope: Our relationship?
Sonny: Well, business landscape's been shifting, Hope.
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra don't even exist,
anymore. But now, Hank Pym?  Hank Pym, is a real opportunity.
Hope: Do you have a point?
Sonny: You think that I don't know what you've been building? With all of this? Quantum technology.And you can forget nano-tech. Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. It's the next gold rush. I want in, Hope. So, as a gesture of goodwill,I've taken the liberty of arranging some buyers for your lab. Starting bid? One billion dollars.
Hope:Thank you, Sonny. Really .But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business.So, I'll just take the component. As arranged.
Sonny:My buyers don't take no for an answer.So, we're either in business together,or we aren't in business together.
Hope:Then, I guess we aren't.
Sonny:You can go.But, I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.
Hope:Listen, Sonny.This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component.
Sonny:No, the only thing you're taking from here, is my heart.But it will mend in time.
Hope:Okay.
Scott: So now what?
Hank:You'll see.
Sonny:She said her and daddy had something pressing.I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not working with us, they're working with somebody.So find out. Name...
[Suddenly,one of the guards is hit by a small moving object on to a table,and the camera focuses on it,revealing it's Hope in a wasp suit.]
Scott: [Suprised] Hold on.You gave her wings?
Sonny: [Yelling in dismay] Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!
Stop firing! Stop!
Alright, take this. Go.
Go, go, go, go!
Scott: 
Wings and blasters.
I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me?
Hank: 
No, I did.
Hope: 
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.
Sonny:
Oh, our business isn't
finished yet, Hope.
I can assure
you of that.
[As Hope exits the building, the same transparent figure reappears in a glitch like state.]

Sonny: [in awe] What the hell is that?

[fights Ghost in her Wasp suit, though Ghost disappears]
Hope: [through mic] Dad, are you
seeing this?

[watching Hope on the monitor with Scott]
Hank: Hope, get out of there!
 [Ghost reappears and flips Wasp onto a table]
Scott: I gotta do something. [goes to leave]
Hank: Wait! [takes out a miniature Ant-Man suit for Scott] 
It's still a work in progress.
Scott: You taught me that
kick. Remember?
Hope: Yeah, great form.
Scott: Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?
Hope: Not the time, Scott.
Dammit, where did he go?
I lost it.
Hank: 
I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.
[static comes through the radio]
Hope: [in distress] Dad?
Ghost: 
Give me that. Now.
Hope: Are you okay?
Hank: No. He got the lab.
Hope: No.
Hank: Come on.
Hope: What was that?
Hank: I don't know.
But we need to find somewhere to
regroup and figure out where the lab is.

Scott: So where to now?
How about my house?
Hank: Mmm?

Scott: I'm supposed to be there anyway. Woo could walk in any second.
Hank: Exactly why we're not going to your house.

Scott: What about your house? [Hank gives him a glare] 
Sorry.
There is one place
I can think of.

Hank: No.
No, no! No! No!
No!
[At x-con building]
Luis: Wow, Dr. Pym.
Like, who would've thought
that, once again,
in your hour of need, that you
would turn to us? You know?
Hank: 
Not me.

?: Help yourself.
Luis: Hey, whats up with the fancy pastry.
We gotta keep the food budget down.

?: Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?
Luis:  The oatmeal packets.

- [scoffs] Oatmeal packets. 
?: It's insult.
Luis: Why's it insult?

- Because it takes like sand.
Luis: You know why? Cause it's organic.

- That is not organic. It's sand.

- The most important meal of the day.

Luis: You know what, you can get creative
with it. Put a little brown sugar on it.
Sprinkle some cinnamon...

Scott: Guys, guys, guys, guys!
Come on, man!
We got bigger fish to fry. [lowering voice] Is that my desk?
Luis: Yeah.
Scott: 
What? Why do I have
such a small desk?
Luis: Cause you weren't there when we're choosing desks.

- You snooze, you lose.
Scott: I was under house arrest.
Luis Yeah!
Scott: 
You know what, this isn't
even a desk. This is garbage.
You found this outside
amongst garbage.
I got it out of
rummage sale.
- So, you saved money on my desk?
- Guys.
Hope, please! We need
to focus. All right?
We gotta find that
lab already. Geez.
Oh, you know what? I heard stories,
like what happened to you.
Like this crazy, creepy cat who like,
walks through walls and stuff.
Like a... Like a Ghost!
Like Baba Yaga.
Baba Yaga. A witch.
They tell stories to
children to frighten them.
You know Baba Yaga?
Whoever stole it...
We need to find it.
Well, you don't find
someone like that.
- They find you.
- Like Baba Yaga.
Dr. Pym, you're like the
smartest genius I know.
Did you put some kind
of lojack on your lab?
Because if you didn't, we have a
variety of affordable options.
Of course, I did, Luis.
It was disabled.
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.
- They also looked like they were phasing.
- Phasing?
Quantum phasing. When an object
moves through different states of matter.
Oh, yeah. That's what
I was thinking.
The lab emits radiation. Could we modify
a quantum spectrometer and track it?
That could work, yes. But all
of my equipment is in the lab.
Well, where else can
we find that equipment?
Well, there is one person.
- Bill Foster.
- Great!
Who's Bill Foster?
He's an old colleague
of my Dad's. From SHIELD.
- They had a falling out years ago.
- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.
It's probably just
a waste of time.
Hey, I'm risking everything by being
here. Don't you think we should check?
We need to find out
who took the lab.
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.
Relax. No one's gonna
recognize us.
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?
It's not a disguise, Hank.
We look like ourselves
in a baseball game.
In an isolated system...
Particles co-exist in a
stable phase relationship. If
the system is interfered with,
that stability becomes chaos.
Unpredictable.
Dangerous.
Beautiful.
Isolated completely, a quantum system would
revert back to separate states of matter.
Each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.
In other words...
The object in question would
be both in and out of phase
with multiple parallel realities.
Speaking of being out
of phase with reality...
I am noticing an unusally high number
of glazed eyes out there among you.
So, why don't we call
it a few minutes early.
That will be enough for today, thank
you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go.
It's incredible.
Your link to Janet.
It's Quantum entanglement,
between the quantum states composed
of her molecules and your brains.
Yeah. It's what I
was thinking.
Do you guys just put the word
'quantum' in front of everything?
Doctor, we need to find our lab.
Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't
have the equipment you're describing.
I told you this was a waste of time.
Come on. Let's go.
Don't condescend, Hank.
You're the one who's on
the run from the FBI.
All because you had
to grow to a size
that finally fit your ego.
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.
Really?
Going that big must've
been exhausting.
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.
Actually, I do.
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner
in a project called Goliath.
Excuse me, you were my partner?
The only thing more tiring
than going that big,
is putting up with
Hank's bullshit.
How big did you get?
My record?
Twenty-one feet.
- Not bad.
- You?
- I don't...
- No, really. I'm curious.
- Sixty-five feet. Yeah.
- Whoa.
- Huge.
- Sixty-five.
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...
We need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet? Strange.
He had all the answers back in the day.
That's why I left the project.
Left? I fired you.
Best decision I ever made.
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental. Stubborn.
Impatient.
Sooner or later he just
pushed everyone away.
Just the mediocrities.
Janet was the only one who could
endure him and chose to stick it out.
Watch it, Bill.
She paid the price
though, didn't she?
You son of a...
We didn't come here to
listen to you two squabble.
I'm trying to save my Mother.
It's Woo.
Someone must have seen me.
Relax. If this is about you
they'd be in your house by now.
- What are you, fifteen?
- Come on. We gotta go, right now.
Wait! You might be able to
improvise that tracker.
If you modify the defraction
units on one of your regulators.
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.
Thank you.
But Doctor, campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.
I don't know what
to tell you, agent.
I haven't talked to
Hank in thirty years.
I can assure you I'm the last
person he would wanna visit.
- Oh, come on. You expect us to...
- Hey, hey.
- Why is that?
- Simple.
We hate each other's guts.
So I'm a terrible partner?
Foster, he hasn't had one good
idea in his unremarkable career.
But his idea about the
defractors could work.
Fine, one decent idea.
Except I eliminated the defractors
when I upgraded the suits.
So if we had an old suit,
we might be able to
track down the lab?
Yes. But we don't.
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?
I mean...
- Life's funny...
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't destroy the suit.
- What?!
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.
I couldn't destroy that.
Before I turned myself in, I shrunk
it down and mailed it to Luis.
You sent my suit
through the mail?
Hey, the postal service is
very reliable, you know?
They do tracking numbers now.
Like UPS.
Where is it?
It's in a very safe place, alright?
Don't worry.
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.
What do you mean it's not there?
Where could it be?
I've looked everywhere.
It's not here.
Hey. Get away from the table.
I put it back out
to Cassie, and I...
Show and tell.
Scotty?
Well, the good news is,
I know where it is.
Whenever you go back to school, isn't
everything supposed to look so much smaller?
This place seems huge. Ah!
- What is it?
- It's the new regulator.
Hank, what's going
on with this suit?
How much of a work
in progress is this?
Uh-oh. Oh, no.
No, no, no.
What, are you laughing?
Please, can you just...
Okay. Okay.
What do you see?
The sizing coils are
malfunctioning.
Just let me...
Oww!
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Okay.
All right.
Try it now.
So...
Awesome.
If only Cap could see you now.
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?
Hey!
Where's your hall pass?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey!
Hey...
You can do it. You
almost got it!
Oh, Peanut.
Okay. Let's go.
Hiya, Champ! How
was school today?
Hahaha. Alright, get
your jokes out now.
- Can you fix the suit?
- He's so cranky.
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?
Do you really have that?
Let's see if Foster was right.
This has got to be the lab.
- Let's go get it.
- Yeah.
This seems right.
Look at us. Teaming
up twice in one day.
Makes you think, huh?
- About what?
- Germany?
- What do you mean?
- We were working together.
Training together. And,
other stuff-ing together.
If I'd have asked you,
would you have come?
I guess we'll never know.
But I do know one thing.
What?
If I had, you'd have
never been caught.
Hey, Scott.
You think you can stop daydreaming about
my daughter long enough to get my lab?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Okay. You're transmitting.
What took you so long?
Sorry, I had to come up
with a name for my ant.
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.
- Like it?
- Hilarious.
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.
- Be careful.
- You know me, Hank.
I'm always care--- Whoa!
- It's okay. It's just a suit.
- How do you know?
Look.
That's Ghost?
What is she doing?
You think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff?
Let's just get out of
here before she wakes up.
Hope, look. There's the lab.
We're sure this is our shrunken building
and not somebody else's, right?
Just take it, Scott.
We gotta be fast.
I'll get it.
Oh, sh...
Hope.
Hank.
Guys?
I don't think they can hear you.
Hi.
I'm Ava.
Scott.
So...
You don't need a suit to, uhh...
You know.
Go through things.
No.
It just helps me control it.
And the pain. Supposedly.
You're not gonna reach into my
chest and crush my heart, are you?
You're funny.
I'm not gonna hurt you
Scott, unless I have to.
I need...
What's in your head.
Let's wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with, shall we?
Get up! Come on!
Dad?
Don't ever touch him again.
Now, now, Hope...
I think I'm being rather gentle with
your Father, all things considered.
What the hell are
you talking about?
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.
Bill.
What have you done?
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.
You with her?
Aw, man. I thought
you were cool.
What the hell is going on here?
I doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father.
Why would he?
Elihas Starr.
They were colleagues at SHIELD.
Quantum research.
Until my Father dared to disagree
with the great Hank Pym.
You had him fired. Oh, and
discredited for good measure.
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.
Desperate to restore his
name, so he took risks.
No!
Too many.
Until something went wrong.
He told us to run.
- Elihas, what's happening?
- Just go. Go!
Daddy!
I can tell he was scared.
- Daddy!
- Ava, no!
I didn't want him to be alone.
No! No!
When I woke up, my
parents were dead.
I wasn't so lucky.
They call it ""Molecular
Disequilibrium.""
A rather dull name, I think.
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.
Every cell, in my body, is torn
apart and stitched back together.
Over, and over, everyday.
I was still at SHIELD
when I got the call about a
""quantum anomaly"" in Argentina.
Hello, Ava.
My name is Bill.
I was a friend of your Father's.
I brought you something.
It's all right. Try again.
That's it.
Dr. Foster did his
best to keep me safe.
But others at SHIELD saw an
opportunity in my affliction.
They built me a containment suit
so I can control my phasing.
And trained me to be
a stealth operative.
They weaponized me.
I stole for them,
spied for them...
I killed for them.
And in exchange for my soul,
they were going to cure me.
They lied.
When SHIELD collapsed,
I took Ava in.
I built the chamber to slow
her decay, but her condition
was progressive. I didn't
know how to cure her.
She wanted to kill you, Hank.
But I told her, no.
And that she should watch you instead.
And sure enough,
she discovered that you
were building a tunnel.
Then she told me about Lang.
And the message from
Janet inside his head...
- For Christ's sake!
- That's me. I'm sorry.
Look, can you tell
me who's texting me?
Cassie. 911.
That's my daughter. I
need to text her back.
No. That's not happening.
It's 911. That means
it's an emergency!
You're not making
demands here, Lang.
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...
Okay, well, she's trying to videochat
me now. Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please!
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?
- I can't find my soccer shoes.
- What?
I have a game tomorrow.
Hey, Scott, I know
that they're there.
Can you just walk the
phone around the house?
- No, I can't do that right now.
- Why not?
Because I'm sick.
Hey, can you just maybe look around later
then call me back? Please? Thank you.
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Peanut!
- Feel better!
- Feel better, buddy!
I'm sorry. It's
that emergency.
Ava, I wanna help you.
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.
- Oh, really? How?
- Janet.
For the last 30 years, she's been
down there absorbing quantum energy.
We can extract that energy. We can use it
to repair Ava's molecular structure...
- Extract it?
- Yes!
Are you insane? That
would rip Janet apart!
You don't know that. I'm
gonna fire up your tunnel.
When Janet's location pops into Lang's
head, he's gonna give it to me,
- or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.
- What?
You're gonna stay here just
in case I need your help.
- Like hell, I would help you!
- You'll do whatever I say.
- You're gonna kill Janet.
- I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.
Goddammit, Bill!
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.
So help me, God...
It's his heart! He needs
his pills, please.
Dr. Foster, they're
in the tin, please.
He could die! For... come on!
Help him!
Dad, just hang on, alright?
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.
- Help him, man! Come on!
- The Altoid tin!
Wait!
Thanks, guys!
Hank!
Bill is filling that
girl's head with lies.
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.
Now, bring her down.
Right, lock it in.
No, no, no. The bolt
is on the other side.
Tighten that one down, then
bring her down with one knock.
- Good job.
- It'll work.
Foster, he could've fried
the entire system.
Look, we'll adjust the relays while you
go reprogram the settings. All right?
It's gonna be fine.
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.
You'd think with all this time
to prepare, I'd be more ready.
Well, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.
It kind of, melts your mind.
- I mean, seeing my Mom again.
- Oh.
What if she's a completely
different person?
Yeah, like George Washington?
- I'm serious, Scott.
- Or, George Jefferson?
What if she's
forgotten about me?
When I was in prison...
The only thing that got
me through was Cassie.
I could've been locked up for 100 years.
I never would've forgotten her.
I know your Mom is counting the
minutes until she can see you again.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- We've got a big problem.
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.
No.
They're on the proposal, and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.
Uh, yeah. Look, it's
been a little crazy...
Look, maybe I can stop by
tomorrow and take a look at it.
No, no, no, no!
The meeting is first thing in the morning.
You gotta come right now and fix it.
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.
You know what, I'm coming to you.
I'll just explain the plans, and
get it on the laptop, and
you can fix them in.
- Just tell me where you are, okay?
- It's complicated.
What do you mean,
it's complicated?
As you can see, sir...
This system is state-of-the-art.
Security of tomorrow... today!
Oh, that's so good! I love the
lead-in, Bro. Keep practicing.
Hey, I just gotta drive on to
Scotty's, so he can fix the plans.
But don't worry. I'll be
back in plenty of time.
As you can see, sir...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Tell me you got the van
washed for tomorrow morning.
Down to the undercarriage, baby.
- You sprung for the undercarriage wash?
- Well, you said get the works.
That's a scam, Bro. We live in
California, not Minnesota!
He's right.
The undercarriage wash.
That's for cleaning
off road salt.
Laid out in all those
snow-laden sister states.
Who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol?
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.
And I do my research, Luis.
To wit, I have learned,
from a friend of mine,
at the FBI, that you're a
known associate of Scott Lang.
A known associate of Hank Pym.
Who I've also learned,
has a portable frickin' laboratory.
Filled with all kinds of juicy tech.
And you're gonna
tell me where it is.
Well, I hate to break it to you, but I
don't know what you're talking about.
Well, I sense a
resistance in you, Luis.
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.
So, I'm gonna introduce you,
to my good friend Uzman.
Now, Uzman, is a master
at extracting information from the
unwillin' through psychoactive means.
Oh, is that truth serum?
There's no such thing
as truth serum.
That's just nonsense from TV.
- What is it, then?
- It's a little concoction,
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the SIS.
It makes you suggestible.
And highly responsive.
- Dude, that's truth serum!
- No, it's not.
No fencing, but,
- this sound like truth serum to me.
- Right?!
- It's not a truth serum.
- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you.
It's not a truth serum.
If it walk like duck,
and talk like ducks...
It's truth serum.
Well, I have a lot of allergies.
So...
You might wanna
think about that.
Time to get that lab back.
What?
The chamber and the suit are
barely helping anymore.
How long have I got?
A couple of weeks, maybe.
Well then, we'll make
them bring the lab back.
How?
Lang. He has a daughter, right?
You can't mean that. Ava?
I tolerate a lot of the
things you do out there,
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.
You're not the one who's about
to fade away into nothing, Bill.
I am!
You said you could fix me.
You promised!
I know. I will.
But not like that.
You let one finger on
that little girl...
I won't help you.
And we're done.
Fine.
There are other options.
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.
'Cause I don't feel anything.
That was a lie. I did feel some...This is truth serum!- There's no such thing.
Okay! Okay, okay.
Now I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.
Okay. Where...is Scott Lang?
Luis: Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I'm not talking about cell block D.His wife had just filed for divorce.And I was like, ""Damn, homie, she dumped you while you were in lock-up?""And he's like,""Yeah, I know. I thought I was gonna be with her forever, but now, I'm all alone!"" And I was like, ""Damn, homie, you gotta chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner.But you know what? I'm Luis."" And he says, ""You know what? I'm Scotty.And we're gonna be best friends.""
Sonny: Wait,hold on, hold on.Now I like a good story as much as the next person,but what's this have to do with where Scott Lang is?
Luis:I'm getting there,I'm getting there.
Dave:You put a dime in him, you got to let the whole song play out.
Kurt:He hit like human jukebox.
Luis:Oh! My abuelita had a jukebox in a restaurant .Yeah. Only played Morrissey.And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like, ""Oh, porque? Gusta mas?"" And El Chicanos, we call them mas, ""then, adios!"" What can I say? We relate to these melancholy bandits, you know?
Sonny:Lang.
Luis:Right, right, right, right .So anyway, this guy gets out of jail and starts working for Hank.And that's when he met Hope.And Hope's all like,""I want nothing to do with you. Look at my hairdo. I'm all business."" And then Scotty's like,"" You know what, girl? My heart's all broken,and I'll probably never find love again.But damn, if I want to kiss you!"" But then you fast-forward and they're all like into each other, right? And then Scotty's like, ""You know what, I can't tell you this,but I'm gonna go trashing the airport with Captain America!"" Then she said, ""I can't believe you split like that! Smell you later, dummy!"" So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he won't admit it, but his heart's all like,""Damn! I thought Hope could've been my new true partner. But I blew it!"" But fate brought them back together,and then Hope's heart is all, ""I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's gonna screw up again and ruin everything.""And in my heart, it's all like,""That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's rent.And we're days away from going out of business! Oooh!""
Kurt:Out of business?
Dave:Days away?!
Luis:Damn truth serum! I was trying to protect you guys.I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss. But we're broke.And the Karapetyans are our last hope, and if we don't show up, we're done!
Kurt:That's terrible bossing.
Dave:Damn, Bro!
Luis:That's on me. That's on me!
Sonny:Hey Enough.I'm gonna ask you
one more time...Where is Scott Lang?
Luis:I've been trying to tell you. He's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.
Sonny:Emotionally speaking.But where is Scott Lang,literally speaking?!
Luis:Oh! The woods.
Ava:The woods?
Kurt:Baba Yaga!
Ava:What do you mean, the woods?
Luis:The Muir woods!
Ava:For God's sake!
Kurt:Baba Yaga, coming late, little children, sleep at eight.
Damn it!
If that freak gets Pym's tech,
I'm never gonna see it.
So what do we do now?
It's easier to steal it from the
feds than from a boogeyman.
Hey. It's me.
How'd you like to
get a promotion?
I've got the location on
Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang.
But you're gonna have to take them down now,
'cause they ain't gonna be there for long.
And when you do, you're
gonna get me that lab.
Understood.
Good news, gentlemen.
Feds are gonna do the
hard work for us.
What are you looking at?
Change my tire!
Sir...
Can you knock?
Sorry, sir. But I
just got a lead.
Ooh. I love leads.
- Systems in the green.
- Priming the coils.
Full charge.
Soon as the tunnel's open, let us know if you
get anything that could be part of her message.
Yeah, yeah. I will.
Okay, then.
Here it goes.
We did it!
You got anything?
Nothing.
Just give it a minute.
Because it could...
No. No, no, no!
- What's happening?
- It's shutting down. Maybe vectors are off.
We've gone over them a million times.
I know they're right.
- Well then, what else could it be?
- I don't know.
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!
Scott, we had...
I'm sorry. I don't know how much time
I have. I need to fix the algorithm.
Trust me, after 30
years down here...
I've thought about it a lot.
Janet?
Hi, Hon.
Hello, Jellybean.
Mom?
It's not the reunion I had
imagined. It's all so rushed.
You two have done
such great work.
You just need
a little...
nudge.
Janet, how is
this possible?
It wasn't a message you put in
Scott's head. It was an antenna.
Clever girl.
I'm so proud of you.
Honey, tell us where you are.
Tell us how to find you.
No, the probability fields are too complex.
That's why I needed to talk to you.
You have to
follow my voice.
- Of course.
- Like tracing a call back to its source.
I'm tracking your signal using
subatomic frequencies,
between point
2 and point 9.
- I've narrowed it to 4 and 6.
- It's too tight. We could miss you.
Look at us squabbling again.
Fine. Between 3 and 7.
Our first fight in decades
and it's over just like that.
Bull's eye.
- Source lock.
- It's you!
Ha! We got it!
You have to meet me in
these exact coordinates.
In the wasteland, beyond
the quantum void.
It's very dangerous, especially on
the human mind. So be careful.
Time and space work
very differently down here.
You have two hours. After that,
the probability fields will shift,
and it'll be another century
before they'll align like this again.
We'll find you.
I know you
will, Jellybean.
Nope.
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.
How did we get up here?
At first, you'll see all kinds of lights,
and it's gonna get really trippy
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Like, really silent.
Scott, I'll be fine.
- I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there.
- Yeah, so you've mentioned.
Um, sorry. I have
to take this.
Hey, man. You coming?
No, I'm not. But you
know what? Ghost is.
And you know what? The
feds, they know where you are.
- What?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
They gave me some truth serum, then all
of a sudden I started talking all honestly,
like, I hate the way that you
use the dishwasher. I hate it.
But you need to go home because
the feds are probably going there now!
And by the way, who puts the
plates on the top rack, okay?
They don't go there!
I feel like
such a jerk.
You're gonna be really
mad. We gotta go.
- What?
- Ghost knows where we are.
- So does the FBI.
- How?
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?
I told him to come here, so I can help
him with the Karapetyan proposal.
Oh, my God!
But... Look, we need to land that account.
Otherwise, we'll lose the business!
Do you know how hard it is for ex-
cons to find work these days?
Jesus, Scott!
90 seconds to
close the aperture.
- You have to depolarize the coils first.
- I know.
I'm really sorry, but the...
FBI is coming
to my place, so...
I have to go.
Can I borrow the suit?
Look, uhh... I'm just
gonna borrow the suit.
I'll come back. Just
tell me where you'll be.
- Don't bother.
- What?
We'll come and get the suit from
you as soon as we find my Mom.
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!
- Scott?
- Daddy?
- It's us, buddy!
- We're here for Cassie's shoes.
He must be resting.
Honey, why don't you go up the
stairs and go look under your bed.
Daddy? You upstairs?
Daddy...
What the?
Really lives like
a pig these days.
Daddy?
Spread out!
- Again?
- You people have no shame!
- The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.
- Yeah. I'm not buying it.
Cassie, let
the man get by.
- But Daddy's super sick!
- I'll see about that.
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick.
Well, I'll take my
chances, sweetie.
He barfed. Like, a lot.
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.
I've seen worse things than vomit.
- Like, a lot, a lot?
- Yes!
- Forget it. Move aside.
- No!
Woo!
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.
I'm sorry. I'm just really sick.
I told you.
Excuse me. Sometimes you
just gotta get it out, you know?
Sorry.
I'll start the van.
You get the lab.
Freeze! You're surrounded!
Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne.
You're under arrest.
- This is harassment.
- Actually, it's not.
What does the FBI even stand for?
Forever Bothering Individuals?
- His monitor check out?
- Of course, it does.
Damn it. It's like I just got
fed a bowl of malarkey.
We got them, sir. Pym and
Van Dyne are in custody.
Seriously? Yes!
Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were
your friends. That's insensitive.
I just really needed a
win, you know? Anyway...
I'll be back later for the official end of your
sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal.
You should feel
great about yourself.
What is it?
We have a man down,
and Pym's lab is gone.
Hey.
- Thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.
So..
How long have you
been Ant-Man again?
Not long.
Things just sort
of happened.
I'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm
sorry for risking everything.
- Dad, it's okay.
- That's not...
I do some dumb things, and the people
that I love the most pay the price.
Mainly, you.
Trying to help
people isn't dumb.
Well...
I screw it up just
about every time.
So maybe, you just need
someone watching your back.
Like a partner.
Well, she's made it clear that's
about the last thing she wants.
- Who?
- Hope.
- What, who did you think?
- Me.
You?
Don't laugh.
- I'd be a great partner.
- Oh, Peanut!
You would be awesome.
And if I let you, I would
be a terrible Dad.
Fine.
Have Hope be your
partner. She's smart.
She reminds me of you.
You gonna go help her?
I think you should help her.
I wish I could, but...
I don't know how I can help
her without hurting you.
You can do it. You
can do anything.
You're the World's
Greatest Grandma.
Agent Woo will
see you in an hour.
An hour? We don't
have an hour.
Aww. You got somewhere
else to be?
Now, that's my girl.
Alright, what's our plan?
To shrink that wall.
It looks load bearing.
Ceiling could collapse...
- Then we run like hell.
- It's made up of 15-20 agents on the floor.
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.
- They're all heavily armed.
- Not great odds.
- You got any better ideas?
- Nope.
But I'm not giving
up on Mom.
She'd be so proud of you.
Okay.
One...
Two...
Scott?
What are you two just
standing around for?
We gotta go
find that lab.
What about me?
Perfect.
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.
Sir.
Okay. Now what?
You're asking me?
Get in!
Hi.
Hi.
Uhh, excuse me. Are we
planning on leaving soon,
or are you two gonna keep staring at each
other until they start shooting at us.
- Hey, Burch.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. They're out.
- I'm on my way.
- As soon as we see him, so was the van.
- How could this happen?
What the dickens?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, uhh... How do
we find the lab?
After I lost it the first time,
I put on a new tracker...
...of sorts.
That'll work.
Is it ready or not?
We can begin the
extraction process now.
Listen, Ava, this whole thing
could be very dangerous.
- Maybe, maybe we should...
- Maybe we should what? Wait?
I've got days until I'm dead.
We're doing this, Bill. Now.
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.
We don't have much time before Mom's
location shifts and we lose her.
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before that.
You know, my Pap-pap always said if you
wanna do something right, you make a list.
So, we should do that.
One, we have to
break into that lab.
Two, we have to kick
out Foster and Ghost.
Three, we have to fight Ghost. That
seems like it should be part of 2.
2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A.
Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh!
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully
grown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed...
Scott...
You want me to start
again? I'll start again.
I'm going to dive.
The only chance we've got is if
the 2 of you are out here
together, protecting the tunnel.
Let me do this,
Hope. Please.
Let me get her.
I think he's right.
Whassup?
You remember that
beloved commercial?
Whassup?
I had him follow us here.
I thought we could
use some help.
All right. I'm in position.
The ants are headed in.
- Copy that.
- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.
- You want a pez?
- No.
Guess who gave me
this for my birthday.
By the way,
I love that suit!
Thanks, man.
I wish I had a suit.
I would even like a suit with
like minimal powers, you know?
Or maybe, even just
a suit. With no powers.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's them.
They can't be far.
Hank? Hank?
Stop it!
Dad, what's your status?
Foster's taken care
of. Suiting up, now.
I just wanted to save Ava.
She's facing death or something
far more terrible. She's afraid.
I'll help you find a cure when
I get back. I promise.
Together, we'll figure
something out.
Good luck, Hank.
Thanks, Bill.
Now, I'm gonna need
you to step back.
Time remaining:
fifteen minutes.
Hank's in, Scott.
Any sign of her?
No. Nothing yet.
Ava!
Call off the ants, Scott.
Oh, boy.
Can I get a status report, cause I got
some serious Ghost problems here!
Ready to dive.
- In case I don't make it...
- Don't. Don't say that.
I can't lose you, too.
I love you, Hope.
Guys, everything's bad
over here. Please...
Now.
Misdirection.
One of the first things they teach you
at Online Close-up Magic University.
No!
All right. We
got it, Scotty.
- Meet us at the rendezvous point.
- Okay. On my way.
Oh, no.
Really?
- This guy? Again?
- Who?
I told you our business
wasn't over.
Change of plans.
Hang on.
I want that lab, boys.
Whatever it takes.
Hold on.
Oh!
That undercarriage is filthy!
Now they have
bigger problems.
Hope, what are you doing? You're
heading away from the rendezvous point.
Don't worry. I'm taking these
guys on the scenic route.
Wait, what
are you... Oh.
No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we're
gonna die! We're gonna die!
Signal lost.
What the hell are
they doing up there?
Recalibrating.
Recalibrating.
You never said it was
so beautiful, Scott.
Recalibrating.
Okay. Anytime now.
Recalibrating.
- Recalibrating.
- Come on.
Signal restored.
Bikes, it's all on you.
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait, Hope!
Well, the 60's were fun.
But now, I'm paying for it!
Be careful up there!
Give me a break. I haven't
driven in two years.
You got pez'd!
Up here!
Oh, that's not good.
Hope!
No!
There it is right there, the lab.
Get it, get, get, get the lab!
I've got her.
Westbound on Primo.
Hope! Wait!
Hey! What about me?
We got you now, Ava!
Not again!
Piece of junk!
Yes!
Go. Go! Go,
go, go, go!
Burch got the lab.
I'm going after him.
No, no, no,
no, no!
Work in progress, my ass.
Scott, where are you? I've got
Burch in my sights. Hurry!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!
- We're running out of time!
Warning. Approaching
quantum void.
I'm coming to you, Honey.
Guys...
Don't you need the
remote to the lab?
I just found it.
We can't grow the lab without it.
Get it to us, fast.
- Yeah, but the van is busted.
- Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.
Wha?
I love you, Dr. Pym.
The remote! We're missing the remote.
We gotta check the van.
Huh?
Awesome!
Hey, I'm going left. But
Burch's boys are all over me.
- I'm on my way.
- Right. I'll get the lab.
Hi!
Oh, that's badass!
Nice!
Toink!
Come here, you little weasel!
Oh, no, you don't!
I guess... Well,
maybe, you do.
Come on!
Anyone see a southern gentleman
carrying a building?
How did he even have
time to buy a ticket?
Just one time, please. Work!
Yes! All right, I need help.
That's it.
Oh... sorry!
Hey! Come on, man!
Not cool!
Murderers!
Yes! Yes!
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas.
'Cause you're a badass! Yes!
No. No. No! Ant-onio!
Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the
San Francisco bay for a little leisure,
- and a little breeding.
- Listen, Uzman...
Just meet me at the
waterfront in three hours.
Oh, folks, we barely left the dock, but
it looks like we have some company!
You see it, folks? There it is. There's a breach.
What the...
Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's
okay, it's okay.
Sorry. No, I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.
Hey! That doesn't belong to you.
- No! No! No! No!
- You're embarassing yourself now.
- Come on. Let go!
- No!
Thank you.
I'll take this now.
No...
... melts your mind...
... a message in your head...
... I had a dream...
Daddy?
Dad?
What's going on? Why
haven't you found Mom?
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?
It's me.
I'm so sorry!
- It took so long.
- No.
I do know...
You're here now.
Let's go home.
I thought I was gone.
But that energy from your hands...
How did you do that?
I'm not the same woman I
was 30 years ago, Henry.
This place...
It changes you.
And adaptation is part of
it, but some of it is...
Evolution.
Lab coordinates not found.
Do not ascend.
I should probably tell you what
we're dealing with up there.
I got the lab. I got the lab.
Move. Move...
Move!
Get out of the...
Let's go.
No one here appears to
be sure what this is.
It seems he's
90, 80, 85 feet tall.
Get out of the way!
I got the lab. The lab! Okay...
The earth feels junky.
Oh, no. He's too big.
- Scotty!
- Scott!
I'm gonna go to sleep.
I'm just gonna go to sleep
now for five minutes.
I just need five minutes.
Five minutes...
You get the lab somewhere safe.
Scott's air won't last!
Okay!
Move. Move. Move!
No, wait!
Lab at full scale.
- They did it!
- Ready to ascend.
Let's go see our daughter.
Scott.
Scott!
Scott, come on. Wake up.
Come on. Come on.
Where are you, Scott?
Gotcha.
Scott?
Hey!
Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in.
Do you take any questions
'bout the building?
- Sco...
- Where's the remote, Luis?
It's probably in there.
I don't have it.
I don't have it.
I guess this is where
we say, Adios, amigo.
No, no, no!
Thanks, guys.
Ava? Ava!
Ava.
- Almost ready for extraction.
- Please, stop. People are getting hurt.
Everything hurts. Don't
talk to me about pain.
What if Hank was right? What
if this process kills Janet?
You're worried about her?
All I'm saying is she's a brilliant
scientist. She may be able to help.
Oh, she will help. Right now.
And if she dies, she dies!
I'm sorry, we can't do this.
We have to find another way.
This is the way.
Janet!
She's starting the extraction.
She's gonna tear Mom apart.
No!
Hope!
Are you okay?
Mom?
Oh, my God.
We found you.
I missed you so much.
I missed you too, Jellybean.
It's okay. I'm, I'm here now.
We have time.
No more last minute
business trips, okay?
I promise.
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry about me.
- I'll be fine.
- Dad!
Scott.
Miss Van Dyne.
It's nice to...
I guess we've already met.
I guess we have.
Wait.
Your pain...
I can feel it.
It hurts.
It always hurts.
I'm sorry.
I think I can help you.
Do you know she could do that?
It's okay.
Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa!
The, uhh, the...
The cops are coming.
Like all of them.
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go.
What about them?
Hands in the air!
No. No, no,
we do our jobs.
You see, we see these guys,
they trying to shoot people.
So we apprehended them. For you.
You're welcome.
- 
[to the police after Luis, Dave, and Kurt capture them] We traffic in stolen technology.
- And they have killed many, many people.
- [referring to Burch] He's in charge.
- That's true. I am.
I've also committed numerous healthcode
violations in my restaurant.
Some of them would shock you. [sees the injection needle] It is truth serum.
We gotta get out of here. Fast.
I have an idea.
Giant figure now spotted at the
intersection of Broadway and Wycona.
- All units move in.
- Go. Go.
There he is.
It's over, Scotty.
I'm sorry but we got you, man.
Come on, it's the end of the line, pal.
There's nowhere to hide.
Just pull off that band-aid.
You lost. it's okay.
Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself!
Magic?
Dammit. Get to Lang's. Now.
Well done, Honey.
Let's go!
- Leave me here.
- We can make it.
You said it yourself.
I've hurt people.
But you haven't.
- Go, please.
- We can make it, Ava.
Bill...
I'm not leaving you.
Oh, hey guys.
Are my two years up already? [as he’s being freed from his house arrest]
What's it like out there?
I mean...
Do people still dance? Are
food trucks still a thing?
You got away with it
this time, Scott, but...
I'll be seeing you again.
Where?
Huh?
Where will you be
seeing me again?
Like...
in general, I'll see you. Like, the
next time you do something bad.
- I'll be there. To catch you.
- Ohh.
You'll be watching me. I thought
you were inviting me somewhere.
Why would I do that?
That's what I was wondering.
Why would you do that either?
Like a party, or
dinner or something?
I don't know. I thought you
were planning the evening.
No. I meant to, like, arrest you.
Like, I'll arrest you later again.
- Take it easy.
- Okay. [turns to leave but then turns back to Scott]
Did you wanna go out
tonight or something?
[Scott shakes his head no]

Jimmy Woo: I mean, 'cause I'm free. [Scott shakes his head; Woo turns to his partner] Yeah. Come on.

- You ready?
- Yes!
- Daddy!
- Hi!
Yes, that was a...
- 8:30, Monday.
- Sounds great.
Mr. Karapetyan?
Yeah, you saw that?
Well, it would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.
I'll see you Thursday, 9 A.M.
Okay.
Cassie:This is awesome.
Hope:So, Cassie...What do you wanna be when you grow up?
Cassie:I wanna help people.Like my Dad.
Hope:Really?
Cassie:I wanted to be his partner.But he said he wants you.
Hope:Is that so?
[Hope and Scott share a look when a (relative to them) big moth lands on the windscreen]
Cassie:Daddy!
Scott:[looks on the windscreen] Hold on. [Scott activate the car's horn] Move! Get outta here!
Hope:No. Don't. Don't!
[Suddenly,a very big moth lands on the car and shakes it.]
Scott:Ah!
Cassie:Ow.
Scott:Ow,gross! Ugh,I hate that moth dust.Go. Shoo! Shoo!
[Credits]
Hank: I used to be a respected scientist. I had my name on the sides of buildings. Now, I got this. 
Janet: Well, you wanted a smaller quantum tunnel. This is... smaller. 
Scott: Oh. Sorry. My bad. 
Janet: Ah, I think it has flair.
Scott: Alright. Control's online. 
Hope: The collection unit activates when you decouple it. It should automaticallt start abosrbing quantum healing particles. 
Janet: Also, make sure you stay out of the tardigrade fields. They're cute, but they'll eat you. And don't get sucked into a time vortex. We won't be able to save you.
Hope: Okay, going subatomic in five, four, three, two, one.
Hank: Alright, Scott, this is a mic check.
Ant-Man: I just wanna make sure. ""Okay. Healing particles secured for our new ghost friend.""
[mid-credit scene last lines; Scott is in the quantum realm preparing for re-entry with the help of Pym, Hope and Janet]
Hope: Great. Preparing for reentry in five... four... three- (stadic)
Ant-Man: Hello? Ha ha, very funny. Hank, quit screwing around. [we see Pym, Hope and Janet have disintegrated. Thanks, Thanos.] You told me yourself not to screw around. Hank! Hope? Janet! Guys. Guys! Okay, seriously, don't joke around, bring me up, let's go! GUYS?!
[The scene changes to scott's house,the tv is static and then we see the ant that replaced scott playing on the drums]
(Ant-Man and the Wasp will return?)
The End.

 Captain America: The First Avenger
 Iron Man 3

     
""And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers Assemble!""
[BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.]
CUT TO: EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE ­ NIGHT[Kneeling behind a THRONE, a clothed, armored figure known as THE OTHER.]
THE OTHER: The tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,... [he holds out the scepter]
Loki: [Coming out from the shadows, taking the staff]
THE OTHER: But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow.
[thousands of Chitauri are awaiting orders]
THE OTHER: The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?


[Cut to a SHIELD facility at night. They are evacuating by helicopter and vehicle, and one helicopter lands, dropping off Maria Hill and Nick Fury while Agent Phil Coulson is awaiting them.]
NICK FURY: How bad is it?
AGENT PHIL COULSON: That's the problem sir. We don't know.
[They enter the facility, passing fleeing technicians, taking only the essentials]
COULSON: Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
FURY: NASA didn't authorise Selvig to test phase.
COULSON: He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement.
AGENT MARIA HILL: It just turned itself on?
FURY: What are the energy levels
COULSON: Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.
FURY: How long to get everyone out?
COULSON: Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
FURY: Do better. 
[They continue walking down deeper into the facility]
HILL: Sir, evacuation may be futile.
FURY: We should tell them to go back to sleep?
HILL: If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.
FURY: I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
HILL: Sir, is that really a priority right now?
FURY: Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every peice of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.
HILL: Yes sir. [To agents nearby.] With me.
[Nick fury and Agent Phil Coulson enter the radiation facility housing the Tesseract, the area cluttered with machines and people leaving.]
FURY: Talk to me doctor.
[Dr. Erik Selvig appears from behind a CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually birghter and a flare of blue shoots out from it, hitting things at random.]
Dr. ERIK SELVIG: Director.
FURY: Is there anything we know for certain?
SELVIG: The Tesseract is misbehaving.
FURY: Is that supposed to be funny?
SELVIG: No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving.
FURY: How soon until you pull the plug?
SELVIG:  She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...
FURY: We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.
SELVIG: We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
FURY: That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
SELVIG: The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual
[We cut to Clint Barton, dressed in black tactical gear, up on the railings watching them below. Fury calls Barton on his earpiece.]
FURY: Agent Barton, report.
[Barton rappels down from the catwalk, and walks up to Fury. They both walk around the bottom of the facility in a discreet manner.]
FURY: I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
CLINT BARTON: Well, I see better from a distance.
FURY:  Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
NASA SCIENCETIST: [To Dr. Erik Selvig] Doctor, it's spiking again.
CLINT: No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
FURY: At this end?
CLINT: Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
[Dr. Erik Selvig types on his keyboard and the monitor flashes. Suddenly, the Tesseract thunders and shakes the entire facility. Both Agent Coulson nearby, and Maria Hill topside, feel the tremors. The cube glows brighter and emits a ring of light, and builds like a beam, similar to the Bifrost bridge. The power hits the edge of the platform, and begins to form a vortex, which becomes a portal. Space appears through the portal, and a gust of blue energy knocks people back. The cloud shoots to the ceiling, and the portal on the platform opens up as Loki steps through. The portal vanishes, and Loki grins at everyone, holding his spear. He frowns as he sees them looking at him.]
FURY: Sir please put down the spear.
[Loki responds with firing a blast of blue energy from his spear, while Barton narrowly tackles Fury out of the way. Everyone shoots at Loki, but the bullets deflect off of him. Loki immediately takes down everyone shooting at him easily, with knives and energy blasts from his sceptre. He pauses, grinning, and looks to who will attack him next. Barton attempts to attack him, but Loki grabs his wrist, disarming him.]
LOKI: You have heart.
[Loki places the tip of the spear against Barton's chest. Barton's eye glow black, and he stops resisting. Loki begins controlling other agents around the room. Fury sneak up, grabs the Tesseract, and places it in a briefcase, trying to sneak out.]
LOKI: Please don't. I still need that.
FURY: [ turning to face Loki ] This doesn't have to get any messier.
LOKI: Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
SELVIG: Loki? Brother of Thor?
FURY: We have no quarrel with your people.
LOKI: An ant had no quarrel with a boot.
FURY: You planning to step on us?
LOKI: I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.
FURY: Free from what?
LOKI: Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...[Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standing behind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow black.]
LOKI: You will know peace.
FURY: Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing.
[From the vacuum chamber ceiling, the Tesseract's energy cloud rapidly builds into what may be an implosion.]
CLINT: Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. 
FURY: Like the Pharaohs of Odin.
SELVIG: He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
LOKI: Well then. 
[Loki looks to Barton, who without hesitation shoots Fury, who falls to the ground. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig, and the other controlled SHIELD personnel.]


[The controlled SHEILD personnel are gathering weapons and getting ready to leave the facility. Agent Hill watches in confusion.]
CLINT: [Pointing to Loki and his team] Need these vehicles.
HILL: Who's that?
CLINT: He didn't tell me.
[Agent hill eyes them suspiciously as they get into a truck and begin to drive away.]
FURY: [grabbing a walkie talkie] Hill, do you copy?
[Loki and his crew look back at Agent Hill.]
[Back at the lab, Fury is sitting up, pulling the bullet out, and breathing hard.]
FURY: Barton is...
[Maria turns around and shoots Barton, who is already shooting at her, and they drive away while she takes cover, still firing at them.]
FURY: [Running out of the lab, holding his side.] He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
[The energy discharge from the Tesseract is building up on the ceiling, rumbling and growing recklessly, destroying structures and cracking the walls.]
[Maria Hill jumps into a Jeep and takes chase on Loki and crew. Several other trucks begin to attack Loki's truck as well, and Loki releases a blast of energy, obliterating SHEILD trucks and causing a blockage in the tunnel. Agent Hill is forced to keep distance on her pursuit.]
[Down below, Fury is racing against the clock as pipes burst around him. The walls are cracking, and the facility is suffering an internal earthquake.]
[Agent Coulson is grabbing cases, and trips down the stairs while the ground shudders. Others with him drop cases full of information and equipment.]
COULSON: No! Leave it! [They all leave the cases behind and leave the lab running.]
[Barton and Agent Hill are caught in a truck race, where she pulls in front of him to try and block him. He responds with firing at her at close range, which causes Agent Hill to shoot out her own windshield to try and hit him.]
[Agent Coulson and his group take a Jeep and evacuate as well.]
COULSON: [on a walkie talkie] You're clear, sir! You need to go!
[Fury runs across the tarmac to a helicopter. The ground gives way seconds after the helicopter leaves the ground, falling into a sinkhole.]
[Still racing down the tunnel, Agent Hill and Barton are locked in combat. A blast wave from the Tesseract causes the tunnel to collapse partially. One of Loki's trucks makes it out, but Maria's truck is stuck.]
[The Tesseract's energy cloud now shrinks into a small ball of white light, hovering in the air. In a flash of blue light, the facility is consumed along with its surroundings. Fury watches from below as a rapid build up into an implosion.]
[Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van jolts from the blastwave on the horizon behind them.]
[The entire facility implodes with terrifying magnitude, and the implosion rocks the ground.]
[Maria Hill is stuckher jeep behind as the full force of the blast tears down on the tunnel, covering herself by being inside of the jeep, light from the night spilling in close by.]
[Barton's truck drives away, but Fury's helicopter hovers over it, and Fury opens fire with his pistol. Loki, in a fit of rage, fires an energy blast at the helicopter. The helicopter is skimmed my the blast, but catches fire. He jumps out of the flaming helicopter seconds before it hits the ground and shreds itself into debris. Fury stands back up, dazed, and shoots at Loki, but they're too far away.]
COULSON: [over a walkie talkie] Director? Director Fury, do you copy?
FURY: The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
HILL: [climbing out of the wreckage of her jeep] A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors.
[From the ground, Fury surveys the wreckage.]


FURY: Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
HILL: [using a walkie talkie] Roger that.
FURY: Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war.
COULSON: What do we do?
[Nick Fury looks up, a thought on his mind.]


THE AVENGERS
[The scene is is Russia. There is a building, a warehouse, next to some unfinished railroad tracks under construction. The building is only occupied by Georgi Luchkov, a Russian general, and two thugs, with a prisoner amongst them, tied to a chair. The taller thug is in the middle of hitting the spy, a red headed Russian woman in a black tank top. They have a conversation in Russian.]
GENERAL LUCHKOV: [in Russian] This is not how I wanted the evening to go.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better.
LUCHKOV: I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items.
[The taller thug pushes her chair back, tilting it over the edge of a few story drop, and Natasha hides her fear.]
NATASHA: I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.
LUCHKOV: Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.
NATASHA: You really think I'm pretty?
[Luchkov walks over to a table filled with tools of torture and interrogation, picking up a pair of pliers. The tall thug next to her forces her jaw open.]
LUCHKOV: We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well... [In english] You may have to write it down.
[A phone rings, and the weasely thug looks to his phone in confusion. He picks it up.]
WEASELY THUG: Ya? [He looks to Luchkov.] It's for you. 
[Luchkov takes the phone, annoyed and angry.]
LUCHKOV: Who the hell is...
COULSON: You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.
[Luchkov places the cell phone against Natasha's ear seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back.]
COULSON: We need you to come in.
NATASHA: Are you kidding? I'm working!
COULSON: This takes precedence.
NATASHA: I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
LUCHKOV: [Confused] I don't give everything. 
NATASHA: [Frowning at Luchkov] Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
COULSON: Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
NATASHA: [After a beat] Let me put you on hold.
[Natasha nods to Luchkov. When he grabs the phone, she hits him with her leg and headbuts him. She stands, still tied to the chair, and kickboxes the tall thug in the face. She rolls over to the weasely thug, trips him, and stomps on his foot when he tries to pin her, then she knocks him out with a headbut. Coulson waits calmly, listening to her take three men down with her arms literally tied behind her back. She flips, breaking the chair on weasely thugs' ribcage, and looks to the tall thug, standing up. She kicks him too, chocking him out cold. She then wraps Luchkov's legs with a chain and pushes him down the hole he was threatening to drop her down. He hangs there, in pain, and she grabs her shoes and the phone.]
NATASHA: Where's Barton now?
COULSON: We don't know.
NATASHA: But he's alive.
COULSON: We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
NATASHA: Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me. 
COULSON: No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
NATASHA: [pausing and hanging up the phone.] Bozhe moi. [Russian translation for My God]


[At night, a slum in India it attacked by a sickness. A little girl runs into the middle of a makeshift hospital in someone's home, pushing through the crowd frantically. She runs up the steps inside to greet the only doctor, Bruce Banner. They begin speaking in Hindu.]
ATTENDING WOMAN: What are you doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here. 
LITTLE GIRL: I have to see the doctor. It's my father.
BRUCE: Calm down. What's wrong?
LITTLE GIRL: My father... [she looks to the other sick people, laying down and moaning in pain.]
BRUCE: Is he like them?
[The little girl holds out money, crumpled and looking desperate.]
LITTLE GIRL: [In English] Please. 
[Banner and the little girl run quickly to the edge of town. She leads him quickly through narrow passageways, and is proving too fast to keep up with. Banner spots a nice car, and looks around, worried. He runs into the girls house, when she leaves through a window, untraceable.]
BRUCE: Should have gotten paid up front, Banner.
NATASHA: [Entering the room behind him, making Banner turn around.] You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. 
BRUCE: Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
NATASHA: Then, what is it? Yoga?
BANNER: You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?
NATASHA: Just you and me. 
BRUCE: And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?
NATASHA: I did. 
BRUCE: Who are you?
NATASHA: Natasha Romanoff.
BRUCE: Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
NATASHA: No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
BRUCE: SHIELD. How did they find me?
NATASHA: We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
BRUCE: Why?
NATASHA: Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.
BRUCE: What if I said no?
NATASHA: I'll persuade you.
BRUCE: And what if the... other guy says no?
NATASHA: You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.
BRUCE: [gently pushing a cradle] I don't always get what I want.
NATASHA: Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
BRUCE: Well, those I actively try to avoid.
NATASHA: This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
[She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look.]
BRUCE: What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
NATASHA: Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be.
BRUCE: So Fury isn't after the monster?
NATASHA: Not that he's told me.
BRUCE: And he tells you everything?
NATASHA: Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
BRUCE: He needs me in a cage?
NATASHA: No one's gonna put you in a...
BRUCE: STOP LYING TO ME! [Banner slams his fists onto the table]
[Natasha grabs a gun hidden under the table, pointing it at him. Banner stays still, grinning]
BRUCE: I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha...
[Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece.]
NATASHA: [on her earpiece] Stand down. We're good here. 
[Dozens of soldiers armed to the teeth have surrounded the small house, but at her signal they back off a bit.]
BRUCE: [smiles back at Natasha] Just you and me?


[Inside a SHIELD analytical room, filled with monitors of partially silhouetted people. Fury stands in the middle, frowning. They make up the World Security Council.]
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  This is out of line, Director. You're dealing with forces you can't control.
FURY:  You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
FURY: Not Asgard, Loki.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2:  He can't be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.
FURY:  Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly...
FURY:  PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
FURY:  This isn't about The Avengers.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1:  We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.
FURY:  I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2: You believe?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
FURY:  No, it's won by soldiers.


[A Brooklyn gym at night. Occupied by one man, beating a punching bag in the gym lights, alone in the floor, lost in the fight. The gym is old, as old as the man inside, Captain America, or Steve Rogers. He beats the bag harder, like physically hurting it will repress the memories.]
[FLASHBACK][Hydra base, Captain America is running through a forest, dodging mortar shells, gunfire and Tesseract energy blasts.]
STEVE:  [Echoey] There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!
[In the present, Steve's punches become harder and more violent.]
[in the flashback, Steve places the compass he has, featuring a picture of Peggy Carter, on the dash as the plane plummets towards the ice.]
[The present, punches become violent and aggressive.]
PEGGY CARTER: [flashback voice] You won't be alone. 
[Red skull picked up the Tesseract, and vanishes.]
[In the present, Steve is breathing the bag with everything he has, destroying it and beating his fists.]
SHIELD SCIENCETIST: [flashback] Oh my god!
[Steve is lying on a table, half frozen, and still partially trapped in a slab of ice. Two SHIELD scientists run equipment over him, checking for his vitals. Something flickers...]
SHIELD SCIENCETIST: This guy is still alive!
[Present. Steve punched the bag, easily a hundred pounds, across the room with one swing snapping the metal chain and pummeling it back a dozen feet, sand spilling out from where he cracked the fabric. He stands up, breathing hard, and grabs another bag, resuming a more normal routine. Fury walks in.]
FURY: Trouble sleeping?
STEVE: I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill.
FURY: Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
[Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down.]
STEVE: I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost.
FURY: We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
STEVE: You here with a mission, sir?
FURY: I am. 
STEVE: Trying to get me back in the world?
FURY:  Trying to save it. [Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects]
STEVE: Hydra's secret weapon.
FURY: Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.
STEVE: Who took it from you?
FURY: He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
STEVE: At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
FURY: Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
[Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Fury starts walking out of the gym.] 
FURY: Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
STEVE: [Without missing a beat] You should have left it in the ocean.


[Out in the Atlantic Ocean, Tony Stark, in his Iron Man suit, is cutting a pipeline transport with a laser cutter coming from his hand. He then places a Stark Energy Reactor. It lights up. Iron Man rockets out of the water and flies towards Stark Tower]
TONY: You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
PEPPER POTTS: [on the other line] You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
TONY: Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
PEPPER: Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?
INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.
TONY: I assume. Light her up. [Iron Man flies to the Stark Tower Building, the power is switched on the Stark sign lights up]
PEPPER: How does it look?
TONY: Like Christmas, but with more... me.
PEPPER Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.
TONY: Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment.
PEPPER: Then get in here and I will. [Tony arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his Iron Man suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of gadgets.]
JARVIS: Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
TONY: I'm not in. I'm actually out.
JARVIS: Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
TONY: Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.
[Pepper Potts stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.]
PEPPER: Levels are holding steady... I think.
TONY: Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?
PEPPER: Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
TONY: What do you mean? All this came from you.
PEPPER: No. All this came from that. [Points to the energy in his chest plate.]
TONY: Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.
PEPPER: Twelve percent?
TONY: An argument can be made for fifteen.
PEPPER: Twelve percent? For my baby?
TONY: Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
PEPPER: Oooooh.
TONY: My private elevator...
PEPPER: You mean our elevator?
TONY: Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
[Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.]
PEPPER: Not gonna be that subtle.
TONY: I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
PEPPER: On the lease.
TONY: Call your mom, can you bunk over?
JARVIS: Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten.
COULSON: Stark, we need to talk.
[Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson.]
TONY: You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
COULSON: This is urgent.
TONY: Then leave it urgently. [At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.] Security breach. [To Pepper] That's on you.
COULSON: Mr. Stark
PEPPER: Phil! Come in.
TONY: Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
PEPPER: Come on in, we're celebrating.
COULSON: I can't stay
TONY: Which is why he can't stay.
COULSON: We need you to look this over. [He holds out a file towards Tony] Soon as possible.
TONY: I don't like being handed things.
PEPPER: That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. [She pases her glass of champagne to Coulson, takes the file from him, then takes Tony's glass of champagne while passing the file over to Tony] Thank you.
TONY: Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
COULSON: This isn't a consultation.
PEPPER: Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
TONY: The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.
PEPPER: I didn't know that either.
TONY: Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.
PEPPER: That I did know.
COULSON: This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
TONY: Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? [Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases.]
TONY: You know, I thought we were having a moment.
PEPPER: I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
TONY: How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
PEPPER: What is all of this?
TONY:  This is, uh... [Tony expands his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper.] This.
[Screens appear of Captain America in action, the Hulk roaring as he attacks the army at Culver University, and Thor fighting the Destroyer in New Mexico. Another is of Loki and the Tesseract to which Tony and Pepper look at in awe]
PEPPER:  I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
TONY:  Tomorrow.
PEPPER:  You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.
TONY: Well, what if I didn't?
PEPPER:  If you didn't?
TONY:  Yeah.
PEPPER:  You mean if you finished? [Tony nods his head] Well, um...then. [She whispers something in his ear. Tony gasps. Coulson looks away in embarrassment.]
TONY: Square deal. It's the last date.
[Pepper kisses him.]
PEPPER: Work hard.
[As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.]


[Inside the Quinjet, Steve is sitting down with a tablet, watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver University]
PILOT: We're about forty minutes out from base, sir.
[Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.]
STEVE: So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
COULSON: A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula. [The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.]
STEVE: Didn't really go his way, did it?
COULSON: Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking. [Steve looks confused.] He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially. [Steve smiles at Coulson.] I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. [Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to the side with Coulson following.] I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board.
STEVE: Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
COULSON: Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
STEVE: The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
COULSON: With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned. [Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.]


[in the underground lab, Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down, watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of the Other, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. The other appears from the steps.]
THE OTHER: The Chitauri grow restless
LOKI: Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
THE OTHER: Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?
LOKI: Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim.
THE OTHER: You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?
LOKI: I was a king! The rightful kind of Asgard! Betrayed!
THE OTHER: Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
LOKI: You don't have the Tesseract yet. [The Other runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.] I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.
THE OTHER: You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. [The Other places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back to Earth. Loki looks around, cautiously.]


[The Quinjet lands down a massive battleship known as the Helicarrier. It has two runways. One with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel. Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with Natasha.]
COULSON: Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.
STEVE: Ma'am?
NATASHA: Hi. [She looks at Coulson] They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace.
COULSON: See you there. [Coulson walks away, leaving Steve with Natasha, the pair walking towards the railing of the Helicarrier]
NATASHA: It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
STEVE: Trading cards?
NATASHA: They're vintage, he's very proud.
[Bruce Banner is seen walking around the ship, trying to stay out of the way while people walk in his way]
STEVE: Dr. Banner.
[The two walk up to each other and shake hands]
BRUCE: Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.
STEVE: Word is you can find the cube.
BRUCE: Is that the only word on me?
STEVE: Only word I care about.
BRUCE: [Takes in the sentiment] It must be strange for you, all of this.
STEVE: [Looks off to where a group of men in training are running, remembering his days in the army] Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
NATASHA: Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
[The Helicarrier starts to shake as it prepares to take ""sail"". Others abord strap down planes and Quinjets in preparation]
STEVE: Is this a submarine?
BRUCE: Really? They wanted me in a submerged, pressurized metal container?
[The two both move closer to the edge of the Helicarrier. Four huge lift fans mounted on the sides starts to lift into the air as the ship takes flight. Steve watches in awe while Bruce just smiles.]
BRUCE: Oh, no. This is much worse.
[The doors part and we enter the bridge of the ship. A flurry of activity, dozens of agents sit in front of their viewscreens. Agent Hill shouts instructions to leave. The camera turns to Nick Fury who is at the command chair.]
HILL: We're at lock, sir.
FURY: Good. Let's vanish.
[The Helicarrier rises high into the heavens. Suddenly the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then camouflages in the sky. Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge]
FURY: Gentlemen. [Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.] Doctor, thank you for coming.
BRUCE: Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?
FURY: Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
BRUCE: Where are you with that? [Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.]
COULSON: We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.
NATASHA: That's still not gonna find them in time.
BRUCE: You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
FURY: How many are there?
BRUCE: Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?
FURY: Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please. [Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.]
NATASHA: You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.


[Back in the underground lab, Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device. Clint walks in, holding a tablet.]
SELVIG: Put it over there! [To Clint] Where did you find all these people?
CLINT: SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. [He holds up a screen showing information on Iridium]. Is this the stuff you need?
SELVIG: Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.
CLINT: Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
SELVIG: Well, I didn't know! [Sees Loki coming] Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth.
LOKI: I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
CLINT: My next target.
LOKI: Tell me what you need.
CLINT: I'll need a distraction. [Grabs his bow] And an eyeball.


[That night in the Helicarrier bridge. As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial recognition, Coulson is standing with Steve.]
COULSON: I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
STEVE: No, no. It's fine.
COULSON: It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
AGENT JASPER SITWELL: We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy-nine percent.
AGENT PHIL COULSON: Location?
SITWELL: Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding.
FURY: Captain, you're up. [Steve nods. Leaves.]


[Outside the Stuttgart Museum, night. Loki is standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st Century attire with his scepter disguised as a cane. He walks up to the entrance of the gala.]
[Inside the Stuttgart Museum. A lavished gala with an orchestra playing is interrupted as the head doctor walks up to the mic.]
[Inside Helicarrier where Steve's locker is. Steve walks into the locker room. As he approaches to the steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated Captain America uniform, along with the famous shield. He stands in silence]
[Outside the museum. German guards stand in their positions. One of them is standing on tip of the roof, scoping. He then hears a sound. He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an arrow. He raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton and his crew arrive at the doors of the locked science building. Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye scanner instrument.]
[Inside the gala, Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the head doctor is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he flips his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki clubs his head in. Chaos erupts. Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures bilchsteim. Loki pulls out an optical torture device. He plunges down the doctor's eye. The doctor twists in pain.]
[Outside the museum. Suddenly from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen. The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium. As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet. The police arrive and with no hesitation, he blasts the cars, flipping them over and over.]
LOKI: Kneel before me. [The crowd ignores him. Three more Loki's appear, surrounding and blocking the crowd from escaping.] I said KNEEL! [While the crowd quietly kneels, Loki embraces out his arms with a wide smile] Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.
ELDER GERMAN MAN: [As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an elder German man refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.] Not to men like you.
LOKI: There are no men like me.
ELDER GERMAN MAN: There are always men like you.
LOKI: Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. [As Loki is about to execute the man with his scepter as the light glows blue. Right as the energy beam shoots out, Captain America arrives, diving in just in time to block the blast with his shield, and knocking down Loki]
CAPTAIN AMERICA: You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.
LOKI: [Standing up] The soldier. A man out of time.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: I'm not the one who's out of time.
[From above Captain America, the Quinjet arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki, while Natasha speaks from inside the aircraft]
NATASHA: Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
[Like greased lightning, Loki sends a blast of blue at the Quinjet. Natasha maneuvers it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both began to duke it out. Loki flings Cap to the ground, and then Cap throws his shield, but Loki swats it away. As Cap is knocked down by Loki, the scepter is pointed to Cap's helmet]
LOKI: Kneel.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Not today! [Cap flips and knocks him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and flips him over]
NATASHA: This guy's all over the place.
[Suddenly AC/DC's ""Shoot to Thrill"" overdrives to the Quinjets speakers]
IRON MAN: Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? [Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his Iron Man suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. Iron Man touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has.] Make your move, Reindeer Games.
[Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armour materializes away]
IRON MAN: Good move.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Mr. Stark.
IRON MAN: Captain.


INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT[Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury speaks over her headset.]
NICK FURY (V.O.): Said anything?
NATASHA: Not a word.
NICK FURY (V.O.): Just get him here. We're low on time.
With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering.
STEVE: I don't like it.
TONY: What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
STEVE: I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
TONY: Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?
STEVE:
 What?
TONY:
 It's like calisthenics. You might have
 missed a couple things, you know, doing
 time as a Capsicle.
 
Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.
STEVE:
 Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
 in.
TONY:
  Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
 doesn't tell you.
 
THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
  violently.
NATASHA:
  Where's this coming from?
 
Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.
STEVE:
 What's the matter? Scared of a little
 lightning?
LOKI:
 I'm not overly fond of what follows.
   
OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
 Not a light. A King.
 THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
 throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
 puts the IRON MAN helmet on.
IRON MAN:
  Now there's that guy.
NATASHA:
  Another Asgardian?
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
  Think the guy's a friendly?
IRON MAN:
 Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
 kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
 Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
 Thor.
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
 Stark, we need a plan of attack!
IRON MAN:
 I have a plan. Attack.
 
IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
 parachute to follow.
NATASHA:
  I'd sit this one out, Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
 I don't see how I can.
NATASHA:
  These guys come from legends, they're
 basically gods.
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
 There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
  pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
 
Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.
                                                                                                                                                                            
EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE ­ NIGHT
[Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
  the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR.
  He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
 angry to see him alive in this fashion.]
THOR:
 Where is the Tesseract?
LOKI: (LAUGHS)
  I missed you too.
THOR:
  Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
LOKI:
  Oh, you should thank me. With the
 Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
 the Allfather have to muster to conjure
 you here? Your precious Earth.
 
Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
 Loki. His brother.
 Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
 everything to a man or god.
THOR:
  I thought you died.
LOKI:
  Did you mourn?
THOR:
  We all did. Our father...
LOKI:
  Your father. He did tell you my true
  parentage, did he not?
 Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
  bigger wedge between them.
THOR:
  We were raised together, we played
 together, we fought together. Do you
 remember none of that?
LOKI: (TURNS AROUND)
  I remember a shadow. Living in the
  shade of your greatness. I remember you
 tossing me into an abyss. I was and
 should be king!
THOR:
  So you take the world I love as
  recompense for your imagined slights.
  No, the Earth is under my protection,
  Loki.
LOKI: (LAUGHS)
  And you're doing a marvelous job with
 that. The humans slaughter each other
 in droves, while you idly threat. I
  mean to rule them. And why should I
 not?
THOR:
 You think yourself above them.
LOKI:
  Well, yes.
THOR:
  Then you miss the truth of ruling,
 brother. Throne would suit you ill.
 Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
  to the ledge. Turns around.
LOKI:
  I've seen worlds you've never known
 about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
 exile! I have seen the true power of
 the Tesseract, and when I wield it...
THOR:
  Who showed you this power? Who controls
 the would-be-king?
LOKI:
  I am a king!
THOR:
  Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
  You give up this poisonous dream! You
 come home.
LOKI:
  I don't have it. You need the cube to
 bring me home, but I've sent it off I
 know not where.
 
Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.
THOR:
  You listen well, brother. I...
[Thor is knocked off the mountain by Iron Man who tackles him in
mid-flight.]
LOKI:
  I'm listening.
EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS
[THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
  IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
 opens up.]
THOR:
  Do not touch me again!
TONY:
  Then don't take my stuff.
THOR:
  You have no idea what you're dealing
 with.
TONY:
  Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
 know you weareth her drapes?
THOR:
  This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
 will face Asgardian justice!
TONY:
  He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
  Until then, stay out of my way...
  tourist.
  The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
  move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
 across into a tree.
[INSIDE THE SUIT]
TONY:
          Okay.
  [From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
  his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
 hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
  IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
  KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
  knocks Thor into a tree.] Right back at you, bitch!
  [Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises
 it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
 the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
  increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.]
[INSIDE THE SUIT]
JARVIS:
  Power at 400% capacity.
TONY:
  How about that?
  [IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
 knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN
 fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.]
EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT
[The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
  him into the side of a mountain.
  THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.]
EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS
[THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
 tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
 HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
  much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
 Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
 with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
  his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
 IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
  arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
 ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
  SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
 him and SMASH him down hard.
 Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
  the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
  the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
  but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
  facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
  CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
  stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
  top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.]
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
  Hey! That's enough!
  (comes down; looks at Thor)
  Now, I don't know what you plan on
 doing here.
THOR:
  I've come here to put an end to Loki's
 schemes!
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
  Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
IRON MAN:
  Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
 hammer!
THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR.
  Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
  raises the hammer.
THOR: [to Cap]
  You want me to put the hammer down?
THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
  CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
 brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
 OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
 IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
 next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
 at both men.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: 
 Are we done here?
THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.
                                                                                                                                                                            
INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY ­ NIGHT
DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
  smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
 on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
 nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT
Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
  GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
 panel of the cell.
NICK FURY: 
  In case it's unclear. You try to
 escape. You so much as scratch that
 glass.
  Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
  cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
 Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
 his pants. Not a god, though.
NICK FURY
  Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
 a steel trap. You get how that works?!
  Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.
NICK FURY
          Ant.
  Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel
  trap.
NICK FURY
  Boot.
LOKI: (SMIRKING)
  It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
  think, for me.
NICK FURY
  Built for something a lot stronger than
 you.
LOKI
  Oh, I've heard.
  Loki looks into the camera.
INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS
The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
  Banner looks at the monitor, intently.
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ CONTINUOUS

LOKI
  The mindless beast, makes play he's
  still a man. How desperate are you,
  that you call upon such lost creatures
 to defend you?
NICK FURY
  How desperate am I? You threaten my
 world with war. You steal a force you
 can't hope to control.
(MORE)
NICK FURY (CONT'D)
  You talk about peace and you kill
  `cause it's fun. You have made me very
 desperate. You might not be glad that
 you did.
LOKI
  Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
  have the Tesseract, to have power,
 unlimited power. And for what? A warm
 light for all mankind to share, and
 then to be reminded what real power is.
NICK FURY: (SMILING)
  Well, you let me know if Real Power
  wants a magazine or something.
 
Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
  at the camera, smirking.
                                                                                                                                                                            
INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS
Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
  even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
  just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --
BANNER
  He really grows on you, doesn't he?
STEVE
  Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
 what's his play?
THOR: (COMING TOO)
  He has an army called the Chitauri.
  They're not of Asgard or any world
  known. He means to lead them against
  your people. They will win him the
  earth. In return, I suspect, for the
 Tesseract.
STEVE: (SERIOUSLY)
  An army? From outer space?
BANNER
  So he's building another portal. That's
 what he needs Erik Selvig for.
THOR
  Selvig?
BANNER
  He's an astrophysicist.
THOR
  He's a friend.
NATASHA
  Loki has him under some kind of spell,
 along with one of ours.
STEVE
  I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
  He's not leading an army from here.
BANNER
  I don't think we should be focusing on
 Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
  cats, you could smell crazy on him.
THOR
  Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
  reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
 my brother.
NATASHA
  He killed eighty people in two days.
THOR
  He's adopted.
BANNER
  I think it's about the mechanics. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
 for?
TONY
  It's a stabilizing agent.
  (walks in with Coulson; to COULSON)
  I'll fly you there. Keep the love
 alive. Means the portal won't collapse
 on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
TONY (CONT'D) (TO THOR)
  No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
  got a mean swing.
  (referring to the Iridium)
  Also, it means the portal can open as
 wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
 wants. (TO CREW)
  Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
  sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
  Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
 (covering his eye, looks AROUND)
  How does Fury do this?
AGENT MARIA HILL
  He turns.
 
Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
 IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.
TONY
  Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
  of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
  get his hands on pretty easily. Only
  major component he still needs is a
  power source. A high energy density,
  something to kick start the cube.
AGENT MARIA HILL
  When did you become an expert in
  thermonuclear astrophysics?
TONY
  Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
  the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
  only one who did the reading?
STEVE
  Does Loki need any particular kind of
  power source?
BANNER
  He's got to heat the cube to a
  hundred and twenty million Kelvin just
  to break through the Coulomb barrier.
TONY
  Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
  stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
BANNER
  Well, if he could do that he could
  achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
  on the planet.
TONY
  Finally, someone who speaks English.
STEVE
  Is that what just happened?
  Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
  the mutual respect for each other shows.
TONY
  It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
  You're work on anti-electron collisions
  is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
 the way you lose control and turn into
 an enormous green rage monster.
BANNER (LOOKS DOWN)
  Thanks.
NICK FURY (WALKING IN)
  Dr. Banner is only here to track the
  cube. I was hoping you might join him.
STEVE
  Let's start with that stick of his. It
  may be magical, but it works an awful
  lot like a HYDRA weapon.
NICK FURY
  I don't know about that, but it is
 powered by the cube. And I'd like to
  know how Loki used it to turn two of
  the sharpest men I know into his
  personal flying monkeys.
THOR
  Monkeys? I do not understand.
STEVE
  I do! I understood that reference.
  Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.
TONY
  Shall we play, doctor?
BANNER
  Let's play some.
  As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
  discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
  playing.
                                                                                                                                                                            
INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)
Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
  the scepter for radiation.
  Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
  algorithms and equations.
BANNER
  The gamma readings are definitely
  consistent with Selvig's reports on the
  Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
  process.
TONY
  If we bypass their mainframe and direct
  a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
  clock this around six hundred
  teraflops.
BANNER
  All I packed was a tooth brush.
TONY (SMILES)
  You know, you should come by STARK
  TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
  R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.
BANNER
  Thanks, but the last time I was in New
 York I kind of broke...Harlem.
TONY
  Well, I promise a stress free
 environment. No tension. No surprises.
  Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
  Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.
BANNER OW!
  Tony looks at Banner closely.
STEVE
  Hey!
TONY
  Nothing?
STEVE Are you nuts?
TONY
  You really have got a lid on it,
  haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
  jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
STEVE
  Is everything a joke to you?
TONY
  Funny things are.
STEVE
  Threatening the safety of everyone on
  this ship isn't funny. No offense,
 doctor.
BANNER
  No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
 aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
 things.
TONY
  You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
 strut.
STEVE
  And you need to focus on the problem,
 Mr. Stark.
TONY
  You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
 and why now? Why not before? What isn't
 he telling us? I can't do the equation
  unless I have all the variables.
STEVE
  You think Fury's hiding something?
TONY
  He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
  secrets have secrets.
  (points to Banner)
  It's bugging him too, isn't it?
BANNER
  (bobbling the words)
  Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
  and...
STEVE
  Doctor?
  A beat.
BANNER
  'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
 jab at Fury about the cube.
STEVE
  I heard it.
BANNER
  (pointing at Tony)
  Well, I think that was meant for you.
  Even if Barton didn't post that all
  over the news.
STEVE
  The Stark Tower? That big ugly
  (Tony gives him a look)
  ...building in New York?
BANNER
  It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
  sustaining energy source. That building
  will run itself for what, a year?
TONY
  That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
  the only name in clean energy right
  now.
BANNER
  (referring to Tony)
  So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
  the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
  they doing in the energy business in
  the first place?
TONY
  I should probably look into that once
  my decryption programmer finishes
  breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
  files.
STEVE
  (taken by that)
  I'm sorry, did you say...?
TONY
  Jarvis has been running it since I hit
  the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
  every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
  tried to hide.
  (holds out a bag of blueberries)
  Blueberry?
STEVE
  Yet you're confused about why they
  didn't want you around?
TONY
  An intelligence organization that fears
  intelligence? Historically, not
  possible.
STEVE
  I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
  This is a man who means to start a war,
 and if don't stay focused, he'll
 succeed. We have orders, we should
 follow them.
TONY
  Following is not really my style.
STEVE (SMILING)
  And you're all about style, aren't you?
TONY
  (a nerve hit)
  Of the people in this room, which one
  is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
  not of use?
BANNER
  Steve, tell me none of this smells a
 little funky to you?
  Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
 shakes it off.
STEVE
  Just find the cube.
  Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
  he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.
BACK IN THE LAB
TONY
  That's the guy my dad never shut up
  about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
  kept him on ice.
BANNER
  The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
 have the jump on us.
TONY
  What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.
TONY (CONT'D)
  It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
 gonna be there when it does.
BANNER
  And I'll read all about it.
TONY
  Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
 the rest of us.
BANNER
  Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
  I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
 nightmare.
TONY
  You know, I've got a cluster of
  shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
  its way into my heart.
  (points at the MINI-ARC
  REACTOR in his chest)
  This stops it. This little circle of
  light. It's part of me now, not just
 armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
BANNER
  But you can control it.
TONY
  Because I learned how.
                                                                                                                                                                            

                         BANNER
          It's different.
         Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
         data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                         TONY
          Hey, I've read all about your accident.
          That much gamma exposure should have
          killed you.

                         BANNER
          So you're saying that the Hulk... the
          other guy... saved my life?

                         (MORE)

                         BANNER (CONT'D)
          That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
          Saved it for what?

                         TONY

                         (A BEAT)
          I guess we'll find out.
         Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                         BANNER
          You might not like that.

                         TONY
          You just might.



 INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C ­ NIGHT

         Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
         STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
         filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
         Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
         onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

         INT. VAN ­ NIGHT

         Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
         driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
         carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
         prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
         ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

         INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ NIGHT

         On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
         looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          As soon as Loki took the doctor we
          moved Jane Foster. We've got an
          excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
          was asked to consult there very
          suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
          private plane, very remote. She'll be
          safe.

                         THOR
          Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
          Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
          him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          He talks about you a lot. You changed
          his life. You changed everything around
          here.

                         THOR
          They were better as they were. We
          pretend on Asgard that we're more
          advanced, but we...we come here
          battling like BILCHSTEIM.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          Like what?

                         THOR
          BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
          antlers. You don't have those?

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          Don't think so.

                         THOR
          They are repulsive, and they trample
          everything in their path.
         Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
         window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                         THOR
          When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
          followed me here and your people paid
          the price. And now again. In my youth I
          courted war.

          NICK FURY (O.S.)
          War hasn't started yet.

                         (WALKING IN)
          You think you can make Loki tell us
          what the Tesseract is?

                         THOR
          I do not know. Loki's mind is far
          afield, it's not just power he craves,
          it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
          that would prize his need from him.

                         NICK FURY
          A lot of guys think that, until the
          pain stops.

                         THOR
          What are you asking me to do?

                         NICK FURY
          I'm asking. What are you prepared to
          do?

                         THOR
          Loki is a prisoner.

                         NICK FURY
          Then why do I feel like he's the only
          person on this boat that wants to be
          here?
         Thor doesn't answer.


                                                                                                                                                                            

  INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

         Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
         stops.

                         LOKI
          There's not many people that can sneak
          up on me.
          (turns to see NATASHA

                         STANDING THERE)

                         NATASHA
          But you figured I'd come.

                         LOKI
          After. After whatever tortures Fury can
          concoct, you would appear as a friend,
          as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                         NATASHA
         I wanna know what you've done to Agent
         Barton.

                         LOKI
         I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                         NATASHA
         And once you've won. Once you're king
         of the mountain. What happens to his
         mind?

                         LOKI
         Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                         NATASHA
         Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                         LOKI

                         (SITTING DOWN)
         Tell me.

                         NATASHA
          (she pulls up a chair as

                         WELL)
         Before I worked for SHIELD, I
         uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
         have a very specific skillset. I didn't
         care who I used it for, or on. I got on
         SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
         Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
         different call.

                         LOKI
         And what will you do if I vow to spare
         him?

                         NATASHA
         Not let you out.

                         LOKI

                         (LAUGHS)
         Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
         the balance, and you bargain for one
         man?

                         NATASHA
          Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
          weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                         LOKI
          What is it you want?

                         NATASHA
          It's really not that complicated. I've
          got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
          it out.

                         LOKI
          Can you? Can you wipe out that much
          red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE
          HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
          everything. Your ledger is dripping,
          it's gushing red, and you think saving
          a man no more virtuous than yourself
          will change anything?

                         (STANDING; ANGRY)
          This is the basest sentimentality. This
          is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                        INTERCUTS
         - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

          LOKI (V.O.)
          You lie and kill in the service of
          liars and killers.
         - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
         oversees.

          LOKI (V.O.)
          You pretend to be separate, to have
          your own code, something that makes up
          for the horrors. But they are a part of
          you, and they will never go away!
         - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
         looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

         HYDRA WEAPONS.

         INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

         Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                         LOKI
          I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
          him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
          every way he knows you fear! And when
          he'll wake just long enough to see his
          good work, and when he screams, I'll
          split his skull! This is my bargain,
          you mewling quim!
         NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                         NATASHA

                         (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
          You're a monster.

                         LOKI

                         (LAUGHS)
          No, you brought the monster.

                         NATASHA
          (turns back around; poised)
          So, Banner... that's your play.

                         LOKI

                         (STAGGERED)
          What?

                         NATASHA

                         (ON EARPIECE)
          Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
          Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
          Thor as well.

                         (TO LOKI)
          Thank you for your cooperation.
         Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

                                                                                                                                                                            

         INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

         Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
         the scepter.

                         NICK FURY

                         (ANGRY)
          What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                         TONY
          Uh...kind of been wondering the same
          thing about you.

                         NICK FURY
          You're supposed to be locating the
          Tesseract.

                         BANNER
          We are. The model's locked and we're
          sweeping for the signature now. When we
          get a hit, we'll have the location
          within half a mile.

                         TONY
          And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
          no fuss.
          (suddenly his monitor show a
          collection of SECRET FILES)
          What is PHASE 2?
         Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
         Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                         STEVE
          PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
          weapons.

                         (TO TONY)
          Sorry, the computer was moving a little
          slow.

                         NICK FURY
          (trying to explain)
          Rogers, we gathered everything related
          to the Tesseract. This does not mean
          that we're...

                         TONY
          I'm sorry, Nick.
         Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

         THE WEAPONS.

                         TONY
          What were you lying?

                         STEVE
          I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
          changed a bit.
         At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
         keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                         BANNER
          Did you know about this?

                         NATASHA
          You wanna think about removing yourself
          from this environment, doctor?

                         BANNER
          I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
          removed.

                         NATASHA
          Loki's manipulating you.

                         BANNER
          And you've been doing what exactly?

                         NATASHA
          You didn't come here because I bat my
          eyelashes at you.

                         BANNER
          Yes, and I'm not leaving because
          suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
          like to know why SHIELD is using the
          Tesseract to build weapons of mass
          destruction.

                         NICK FURY
          Because of him.
          (pointing at Thor)

                         THOR

                         (STUNNED)
          Me?

                         NICK FURY
         Last year earth had a visitor from
         another planet who had a grudge match
         that leveled a small town. We learned
         that not only are we not alone, but we
         are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                         THOR
         My people want nothing but peace with
         your planet.

                         NICK FURY
         But you're not the only people out
         there, are you? And, you're not the
         only threat. The world's filling up
         with people who can't be matched, they
         can't be controlled.

                         STEVE
         Like you controlled the cube?

                         THOR
         You're work with the Tesseract is what
         drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
         the signal to all the realms that the
         earth is ready for a higher form of
         war.

                         STEVE
         A higher form?

                         NICK FURY
         You forced our hand. We had to come up
         with something.

                         TONY
         Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
         calms everything right down.

                         NICK FURY
         Remind me again how you made your
         fortune, Stark?

                         STEVE TONY
         I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
         weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
         deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
         everything?
          I thought humans were more
          evolved than this.

                         NICK FURY
          Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
          and blow stuff up?

                         THOR
          Did you always give your champions such
          mistrust?

                         NATASHA BANNER
         Are you all really that Captain America is on
         naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
         threats? watch list?

                         TONY STEVE
          (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
         You're on that list? Are you more crack...
         above or below angry bees?
         Threatening! I feel
         threatened!
         As the ""team"" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
         scepter is glowing brightly.

         INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER ­ DAY

         Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
         ship.

          SHIELD BASE VOICE
          661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
          What is your hull, over?

                         BARTON
          Arms to ammunition, over.
         Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
         pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

         INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

         Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
         each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                         THOR
          You speak of control, yet you court
          chaos.

                         BANNER
          It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
          are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
          chemical mixture that makes chaos.
          We're... we're a time-bomb.

                         NICK FURY
          You need to step away.

                         TONY
          (puts his arm around Steve)
          Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
          steam?

                         STEVE
          (pushes Tony off)
          You know damn well why! Back off!

                         TONY
          (comes face-to-face with Cap)
          Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
          me.

                         STEVE
          Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
          off, what are you?

                         TONY
          Genius, billionaire, playboy,
          philanthropist.

                         STEVE
          I know guys with none of that worth ten
          of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                         (MORE)

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
          The only thing you really fight for is
          yourself. You're not the guy to make
          the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
          wire and let the other guy crawl over
          you.

                         TONY
          I think I would just cut the wire.

                         STEVE

                         (SMILING)
          Always a way out... You know, you may
          not be a threat, but you better stop
          pretending to be a hero.

                         TONY
          (that did it)
          A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
          Rogers. Everything special about you
          came out of a bottle!

         OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
         The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
         of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
         out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
         right at the engine.
         Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
         feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
         SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
         engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

         INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

         Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
         stands there, unmoving.

                         STEVE
          Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
         Thor laughs at them.

                         THOR
          You people are so petty... and tiny.
         Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                         BANNER
          Yeah, this is a tee...

                         NICK FURY
          Agent Romanoff, would you escort
          Dr.Banner back to his...

                         BANNER
          Where? You rented my room.

                         NICK FURY
          The cell was just in case...

                         BANNER
          In case you needed to kill me, but you
          can't! I know! I tried!

                         (A BEAT)
          I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
          put a bullet in my mouth and the other
          guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
          focused on helping other people. I was
          good, until you dragged me back into
          this freak show and put everyone here
          at risk!
         Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
         unnerved.

                         BANNER
          You wanna know my secret, Agent
          Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
          calm?
         BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                         STEVE
          Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

         BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
         SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                         TONY
          Got it.
         Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                         BANNER
          Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
          little party trick after all.

                         THOR
          Located the Tesseract?

                         TONY
          I can get there faster.

                         STEVE
          Look, all of us...

                         THOR
          The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
          human is a match for it.
         Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                         STEVE
          You're not going alone!

                         TONY
          You gonna stop me?

                         STEVE
          Put on the suit, let's find out.

                         TONY
          I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                         STEVE
          Put on the suit.
         At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
         something about the Tesseract.

                         BANNER
          Oh, my God!

         OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
         Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

         Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and

                         STEVE
          Put on the suit!

                         TONY
          Yep!
         Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
         his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

         Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
         landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
         control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                         NATASHA (CONT'D)
          (quietly, to herself)
          I'm okay. We're okay, right?

         Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel

          Get that engine down! Detention! Get

          Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
         Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
         IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

         INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ CONTINUOUS

         ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
         the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
         Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                         NATASHA
          Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
          This is just what Loki wants. We're
          gonna be okay. Listen to me.
         Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
         furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                         NATASHA
          We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
          my life I will get you out of this, you
          will walk away, and never...

          Your life?
         His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
         morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
         carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
         lights go out.

                         (PLEADING)
          Bruce.
         Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
         Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
         rubble. She stops.
         The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
         disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
         chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
         She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
         pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
         Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
         stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
         anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          Why water? Navigations recalibrated

          Good. See what we got.
         Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
         engine.

         INSIDE THE SUIT
         Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
         its layouts.

          I gotta get this super conducting
          cooling system back online before I can

          I need you to get to that engine
          control panel and tell me which relays
          are in overload position.
         IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
         JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
         AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
         man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                         IRON MAN
          What's it look like in there?

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA

          Well, you're not wrong.

         INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

         Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
         Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
         Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
         and spins.
         ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
         nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
         SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
         corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
         Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
         her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
         Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

         SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
         The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
         never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
         KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

         INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ CONTINUOUS

         Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
         hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
         stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
         The HULK makes his move.
         SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
         HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
         off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
         wraps around it.

                         THOR
          We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
          think!
         HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

         FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

                         TONY
          Even if I clear the rotors, this thing

                         TONY
          See that red lever? It'll slow the
          rotors down long enough for me to get
          out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
         CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
         sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

         INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY

         Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
         head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
         off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
         out.
         The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
         toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
         right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand
         and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
         HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
         happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
         jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

         THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
         Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
         Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
         heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
         can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand.
         Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
         hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
         might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
         Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
         hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
         CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          GRENADE!
         The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a

         waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
         A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
         one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,

                         ESCORT 606 PILOT
          Target acquired. Target engaged.
          (pulls the trigger; fires
          guns at HULK)
         A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for
         cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
         jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

         ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                         ESCORT 606 PILOT

          TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!
         HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK
         tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

         HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

         THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
         ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

         PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

         EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

         IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
         on it, relieving the rotors.
         On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
         AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
         they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
         CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
         Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
         throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
         CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
         for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
         down at them.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
         are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                         NICK FURY
          They are not getting through here, so
          what the hell...
         Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
         critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
         Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

         OUTLETS.
         Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
         activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
         single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
         shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
         to one side.

          AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
          Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                         NICK FURY
          It's Barton. He took out our systems.
          He's headed for the detention level.
          Does anybody copy?

         INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

         Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking
         back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her
         coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

                         NATASHA
          This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
         Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

         EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

         IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

          NICK FURY (V.O.)
          Stark, we're losing altitude.

                         IRON MAN
          Yeah. Noticed.
         The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
         BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
         On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
         Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
         loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
         a LOOSE CABLE.

         INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

         Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,
         escaping.

                         THOR

          NO!
         Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
         down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
         dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
         the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
         smiles.

                         LOKI
          Are you ever not going to fall for
          that?

         INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

         Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
         Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
         fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
         Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

         INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

         Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÖLNIR onto the glass cell. To
         his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
         the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

         SOLDIER.

                         LOKI
          (smiles; walks over to the

                         CONTROL PANEL)
          The humans think us immortal. Should we
          test that?
         Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
         stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          Move away, please.
         Loki moves away from the switch.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          You like this? We started working on
          the prototype after you sent THE
          DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
          does. Do you wanna find out?

         A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

         REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                         THOR
          Nooo!
         Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
         down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
         He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
         Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

         DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

         INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

         Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
         KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
         her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
         Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
         SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
         LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
         wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
         Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
         LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
         down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                         BARTON
          Natasha...
         Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

         EXT. SKY

         Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
         pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
         but misses. Land draws closer.
         In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
         the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
         the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
         into the meadow.

         INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

         Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
         proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          You're gonna lose.

                         LOKI

                         (TURNING)
          Am I?

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          It's in your nature.

                         LOKI
          Your heroes are scattered, your
          floating fortress falls from the
          sky...where is my disadvantage?

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          You lack conviction.

                         LOKI
          I don't think I...

         AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

         CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          So that's what it does.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
         has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

         EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

         IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
         ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
         itself.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         TONY
          Cap, I need the lever!

          STEVE (V.O.)
          I need a minute here!

                         TONY
          Lever. Now!
         Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
         then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
         rotors, getting chewed up.

         EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

         CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
         railing.
         BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
         up and finally PULLS the lever.
         A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
         heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
         BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
         wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

         OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
         The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
         Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

         INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

         Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

                         NICK FURY
          Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          No. I'm clocked out here.

                         NICK FURY
          Not an option.

          AGENT PHIL COULSON
          It's okay, boss. This was never going
          to work... if they didn't have
          something... to...
         Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
         on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY



          NICK FURY (V.O.)
          Agent Coulson is down.
         Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
         her headset, standing up.

          SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
          Paramedics are on their way.

          NICK FURY (V.O.)
          They're here.


                                                                                                                                                                            

   INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

         Steve and Tony listen in as well.

          NICK FURY (V.O.)
          They called it.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ LATER

         Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
         there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
         on their devastated faces.

                         NICK FURY
          These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
          Guess he never did get you to sign
          them.
         Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
         towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                         NICK FURY
          We're dead in the air up here. Our
          communications, location of the cube,
          Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
          Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
          coming.

                         (A BEAT)
          Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
          with the Tesseract. I never put all my
          chips on that number though, because I
          was playing something even riskier.
          There was an idea, Stark knows this,
          called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
          idea was to bring together a group of
          remarkable people, see if they could
          become something more. See if they
          could work together when we needed them
          to, to fight the battles that we never
          could. Phil Coulson died still
          believing in that idea, in heroes.
         Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                         NICK FURY
          Well, it's an old fashioned notion.


                                                                                                                                                                            

   EXT. MEADOW ­ DAY

         Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJÖLNIR.

         INT. ABANDONED BUILDING ­ DAY

         Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
         IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
         IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
         amazed.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          You fell out of the sky.

                         BANNER

                         (COMING TO)
          Did I hurt anybody?

                         SECURITY GUARD
          There's nobody around here to get hurt.
          You did scare the hell out of some
          pigeons though.

                         BANNER
          Lucky.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Or just good aim. You were awake when
          you fell.

                         BANNER
          You saw?

                         SECURITY GUARD
          The whole thing, right through the
          ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
          nude. Here...
         He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          I didn't think those would fit you
          until you shrunk down to a regular size
          fella.

                         BANNER
          Thank you.
         A beat.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Are you an alien?

                         BANNER
          What?

                         SECURITY GUARD
          From outer space, an alien?

                         BANNER
          No.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Well then, son, you've got a condition.


                                                                                                                                                                            

      INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM ­ DAY

         Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton
         tries to shake off Loki's mind control.

                         NATASHA
          Clint, you're gonna be alright.

                         CLINT BARTON
          You know that? Is that what you know? I
          got...I gotta go in though. I gotta
          flush him out.

                         NATASHA
          We don't have that long, it's gonna
          take time.

                         CLINT BARTON
          I don't understand. Have you ever had
          someone take your brain and play? Pull
          you out and send something else in? Do
          you know what it's like to be unmade?

                         NATASHA
         You know that I do.

                         CLINT BARTON
         Why am I back? How did you get him out?

                         NATASHA
         Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
         really hard in the head.

                         CLINT BARTON
         Thanks.
          (Natasha unfastens the

                         RESTRAINTS)
         Tasha, how many agents?

                         NATASHA
         Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
         Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
         and magic and nothing we were ever
         trained for.

                         CLINT BARTON
         Loki, he got away?

                         NATASHA
         Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                         CLINT BARTON
         I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
         He's gonna make his play soon though.
         Today.

                         NATASHA
         We gotta stop him.

                         CLINT BARTON
         Yeah? Who's we?

                         NATASHA
         I don't know. Whoever's left.

                         CLINT BARTON
         Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's
         eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

                         NATASHA
         Now you sound like you.
         Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

                         CLINT BARTON
          But you don't. You're a spy, not a
          soldier. Now you want to wade into a
          war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

                         NATASHA
          He didn't, I just...

                         NATASHA
          I've been compromised. I got red in my
          ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.


                                                                                                                                                                            

    INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

         Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a
         word. Steve walks in.

                         STEVE
          Was he married?

                         TONY
          No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                         STEVE
          I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                         TONY
          He was an idiot.

                         STEVE
          Why? For believing?

                         TONY
          For taking on Loki alone.

                         STEVE
          He was doing his job.

                         TONY
          He was out of his league. He should
          have waited. He should have...

                         STEVE
         Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                         TONY

                         (WALKS AWAY)
         Right. How did that work for him?

                         STEVE
         Is this the first time you've lost a
         soldier?

                         TONY
          (turns around sharply)
         WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
         to Fury's fife!

                         STEVE
         Neither am I! He's got the same blood
         on his hands as Loki does. Right now
         we've got to put that aside and get
         this done. Now Loki needs a power
         source, if we can put together a
         list...

                         TONY
          (looking at the blood stained

                         WALL)
         He made it personal.

                         STEVE
         That's not the point.

                         TONY
         That is the point. That's Loki's point.
         He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                         STEVE
         To tear us apart.

                         TONY
         He had to conquer his greed, but he
         knows he has to take us out to win,
         right? That's what he wants. He wants
         to beat us and he wants to be seen
         doing it. He wants an audience.

                         STEVE
          Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                         TONY
          Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
          opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
          He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
          wants a monument built in the skies
          with his name plastered...

                         (PAUSE)
          Sonofabitch!

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-
         upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.

         INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM ­ DAY

         Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

                         STEVE
          Time to go.

                         NATASHA
          Go where?

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly
          one of those jets?
         Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

                         CLINT BARTON
          I can.
         Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's
         on their side.

                         STEVE
          You got a suit?

                         CLINT BARTON
          Yeah.

                         STEVE
          Then suit up.

                        MONTAGE
         - KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from
         above, colliding on MJÖLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

         MIGHTY THOR.
         - CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.
         - Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON
         MAN's eye holes.
         - BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her
         wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.
         - HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.

         EXT/INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

         Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
         YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.

          YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
          You are not authorized to be here...

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Son... just don't.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill
         walks up to him, knowing.

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          Sir.

                         NICK FURY
          Agent Hill?

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          Those cards, they were in Coulson's
          locker, not in his jacket.

                         NICK FURY
          They needed the push.
          (holding Coulson's cards)
         A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
         off as well as the QUINJET.

                         NICK FURY
          They found it. Get our communications
          back up, whatever you have to do. I
          want eyes on everything.

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          Yes, sir.

         EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
         device, holding the Tesseract.

                         JARVIS
          Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
          device is already self-sustained.

                         TONY
          Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                         SELVIG
          It's too late! It can't stop now. He
          wants to show us something! A new
          universe.

                         IRON MAN
          Okay.
         IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
         from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
         backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
         TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                         JARVIS
          The barrier is pure energy. It's
          unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
          to be deployed.

                         TONY
          Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
          clock.
         TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
         him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
         the penthouse.

         INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

         Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
         steps, towards the bar.

                         LOKI
          Please tell me you're going to appeal
          to my humanity.

                         TONY
          Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
          you.

                         LOKI
          You should have left your armor on for
          that.

                         TONY
          Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
          You've got the blue stick of destiny.
          Would you like a drink?

                         LOKI
          Stalling me won't change anything.

                         TONY
          No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
          sure? I'm having one.

                         LOKI
          The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
          change that. What have I to fear?

                         TONY

          THE AVENGERS.
          (Loki looks at him, confused)
          It's what we call ourselves, sort of
          like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
          type of thing.

                         LOKI
          Yes, I've met them.

                         TONY

                         (SMILING)
          Yeah, takes us a while to get any
          traction, I'll give you that one.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
          But, let's do a head count here. Your
          brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
          a living legend who kind of lives up to
          the legend; a man with breath-taking
          anger management issues; a couple of
          master assassins, and you, big fella,
          you've managed to piss off every single
          one of them.

                         LOKI
          That was the plan.

                         TONY
          Not a great plan. When they come, and
          they will, they'll come for you.
         From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
         BRACELETS, a honing device.

                         LOKI
          I have an army.

                         TONY
          We have a HULK.

                         LOKI
          I thought the beast had wandered off.

                         TONY
          You're missing the point. There's no
          throne, there is no version of this,
          where you come out on top. Maybe your
          army comes and maybe it's too much for
          us, but it's all on you. Because if we
          can't protect the Earth, you can be
          damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                         LOKI
          (slowly walks up to him;
          raising the scepter)
          How will your friends have time for
          me,when they're so busy fighting you?
         Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
         Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                         LOKI
          It should work.

                         TONY
          Well, performance issues. You know?
         In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
         the room.

                         TONY
          Jarvis. Anytime now.
         Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                         LOKI
          You will all fall before me.
         LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
         From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
         The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
         begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
         It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
         the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                         IRON MAN
          And there's one other person you pissed
          off! His name was Phil.
         Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
         his ass.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
         the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

         ANOTHER PORTAL.

         EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

         A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
         out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
         the end.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         TONY
          Right. Army.
         IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
         miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
         JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
         missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
         flies towards the city.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
         the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
         BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

         AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

         BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

         EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
         out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
         Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                         THOR
          Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
          destroy it!

                         LOKI
          You can't. There is no stopping it.
          There is only the war!

                         THOR
          So be it.
         Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
         collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
         and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
         They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
         towards his tower.

         EXT. SKY ­ DAY

         The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

          BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
          Stark, we're heading north east.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         IRON MAN
          What, did you stop for drive-thru?
          Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
          for you.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
         at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
         crash.
         Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
         QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

         CHITAURI.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         JARVIS
          Sir, we have more incoming.

                         TONY
          Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
         IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
         scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

         INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

         HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                         HAWKEYE
          Yeah.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          See them.
         HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
         Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
         ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
         THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
         of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
         PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

         INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

         With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
         seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
         by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
         in hand.

         EXT. FOUR WAY STREET ­ DAY

         The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
         the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
         With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

         EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

         From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
         Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
         OVER the TRIO.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
         SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
         buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
         begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Stark, are you seeing this?

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         TONY
          I'm seeing, still working on believing.
          Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

          CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
          Banner?

                         TONY
          Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
          soft spot.
         IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

         LEVIATHAN.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
         the city falling to ash.

                         THOR
          Look at this! Look around you! You
          think this madness will end with your
          rule?

                         LOKI
          (tries to look away)
          It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                         THOR
          No. We can. Together.
         Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
         stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                         LOKI
          Sentiment.
         Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
         SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
         looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
         CHITAURI follow his lead.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
         taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

         CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

         IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
         TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
         shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
         bridge.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Those people need assistance down
          there.
         CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
         them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          We got this. It's good. Go!

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA

                         (AT HAWKEYE)
          You think you can hold them off?

                         HAWKEYE
          Captain.
          (pulls a trigger on his bow;
          a narrow is mechanically

                         CHOSEN)
          It would be my genuine pleasure.
         HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
         seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
         followed by an EXPLOSION.
         Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
         cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
         HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
         CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
         to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
         People begin to run out.
         BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
         ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                         HAWKEYE
          You and I remember Budapest
          verydifferently.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
         pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                         YOUNG COP
          We need to get out! They gotta bring
          the National Guard!

                         POLICE SERGEANT
          National Guard? Does the army know
          what's happening here?

                         YOUNG COP
          Do we?
         CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
         ridiculous looking man.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          I need men in these buildings. There
          are people inside that can run into the
          line of fire. You take them through the
          basement or through the subway. You
          keep them off the streets. I need a
          perimeter as far back as 39th.

                         POLICE SERGEANT
          Why the hell should I take orders from
          you?
         Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
         is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
         watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
         Sergeant turns to his officer.

                         POLICE SERGEANT
          I need men in those buildings, lead the
          people down and away from the streets.
          I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

         EXT. SKY LINE ­ DAY

         IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
         LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
         and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
         CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                         IRON MAN

                         (TO JARVIS)
          We got his attention. What the hell is
          step two?!
         IRON MAN flies away.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
         throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
         STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
         CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
         WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
         until...
         Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
         firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
         They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
         SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          What's the story upstairs?

                         THOR
          The powers surrounding the cube is
          impenetrable.

          IRON MAN (V.O.)
          Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
          guys.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          How do we do this?

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          As a team.

                         THOR
          I have unfinished business with Loki.

                         HAWKEYE
          Yeah, get in line.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
          focused on us and that's what we need.
          Without him these things could run
          wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
          need us...
         Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
         looks around the city.

                         BANNER
          So, this all seems horrible.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          I've seen worse.

                         BANNER
          Sorry.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          No. We could use a little worse.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Stark? We got him.

          IRON MAN (V.O.)
          Banner?

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Just like you said.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         TONY
          Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
          the party to you.
         IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
         LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
         still.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          I... I don't see how that's a party...
         IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
         swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
         keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
         Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
          time for you to get angry.

                         BANNER
          That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
          angry.
         Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

         SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
         Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

         LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
         IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
         to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT ­ LARGE
         CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
         CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
         withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
         raises his SHIELD to block them.
         From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
         horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

         UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

         SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

         EXT. SKY ­ DAY

         Loki watches below, motionless.

                         LOKI
          Send the rest.

         EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

         From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

         MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Guys.

                         IRON MAN
          Call it, Cap.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Alright, listen up. Until we can close
          that portal up there, we're gonna use
          containment. Barton, I want you on that
          roof, eyes on everything. Call out
          patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
          perimeter. Anything gets more than
          three blocks out, you turn it back or
          your turn it to ash.

                         HAWKEYE
          Wanna give me a lift?

                         IRON MAN
          Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
         IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
          that portal. Slow them down. You've got
          the lightning. Light the bastards up.
          (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
          You and me, we stay here on the ground,
          keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

         THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

         UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

         CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

         HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
         THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
         CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

         THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

         IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

         MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

         OUT OF ALTITUDE.

         EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ­ DAY

         Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÖLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
         BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

         MJÖLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

         THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

         CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

         IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

         DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

         LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
         going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          Sir. The council is on.
         OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

         EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

         Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
         of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
         AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
         EXPLODING a RIDER.

                         HAWKEYE
          Stark. You got a lot of strings
          sticking to your tail.

                         IRON MAN
          Just try and keep them off the streets.

                         HAWKEYE
          Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
          Find a tight corner.

                         IRON MAN
          I will roger that.
         IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
         HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
         CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
         TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

                         TONY
          Nice call. What else you got?

          HAWKEYE (V.O.)
          Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
          on 6th.

                         TONY
          And he didn't invite me?

         EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

         We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
         around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
         another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
         mesmerized by what lies beyond.
         WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

         EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

         Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

         CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

         POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

         LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

         WAVE OFF THE HULK.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
         CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
         throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
         there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
          damn thing if we don't close that
          portal.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Well, maybe it's not about guns.
          (gestures the flying

                         CHARIOTS)

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          You wanna get up there, you're gonna
          need a ride.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          I got a ride. I could use a lift
          though.
         BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
         and angles his SHIELD.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Are you sure about this?

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

         BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

         MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

         SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

         FLYING CHARIOT.
         [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
         one extended shot.]
         - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
         shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
         her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
         building.
         - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
         following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
         fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
         BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
         a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
         - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
         one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

         IRON MAN.
         - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
         CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

         BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
         SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

         THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

         IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

         INT. HISTORY MUSEUM ­ DAY

         The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
         and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
         bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

         WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
         confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
         FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
         SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
         BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                         HAWKEYE
          Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
          they caught a lot of civilians there.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          I'm on it.

         INT. 42NDBANK ­ DAY

         Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
         uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
         pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

         BEEPS.
         CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
         at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
         rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
         them.
         CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
         BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
         A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
         HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                         CAPTAIN AMERICA
          Everyone! Clear out!
         CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
         just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
         trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
         through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
         look up from below. They're okay.

         Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
         police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
         A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

         SECURITY COUNCIL.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
          Director Fury, the council has made a
          decision.

                         NICK FURY
          I recognize the council has made a
          decision, but given that it's a stupid
          ass decision, I've elected to ignore
          it.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
          Director, you're closer than any of
          oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                         NICK FURY
          That is the island of Manhattan,
          Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
          can't hold it, I will not order a
          nuclear strike against a civilian
          population.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
          If we don't hold them in the air, we
          lose everything.

                         NICK FURY
          I send that bird out, we already have.
         Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
         her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
         she looks behind.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Oh. You.
         LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
         between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

         EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

         HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                         HAWKEYE
          Nat, what are you doing?

          BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
          Uh... a little help!
         HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
         at Loki, smiling.

                         HAWKEYE
          I've got him.

         FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

         HEAD...

         SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

         AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

         BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

         THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
         BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
         the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
         edge.

         EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

         As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
         LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
         COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
         attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

         STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                         LOKI

          ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

          ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

          I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

         HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

         REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

         FLATTENING LOKI.

                         HULK

          PUNY GOD.

         LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
         weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
         firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
         energy moving through the sky.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Doctor.

                         SELVIG
          Loki's scepter, the energy...the
          Tesseract can't fight. You can't
          protect against yourself.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          It's not your fault. You didn't know
          what you were doing.

                         SELVIG
          Well, actually I think I did. I built
          in a safety to cut the power source.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Loki's scepter.

                         SELVIG
          It might be able to close the portal.
          (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                         GOLD GLEAM)
          And I'm looking right at it.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
         hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
         through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
         off SOLDIERS.
         IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
         LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                         JARVIS
          Sir, we will lose power before you cut
          through that shell.
         IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                         IRON MAN
          JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
          Jonah?

                         JARVIS
          I wouldn't consider him a role model.

         IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
         ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
         IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
         CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
         wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
         sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
         holding out their rifles.

         EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

         HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
         he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
         off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
         HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
         GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
         HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
         and CANNONBALLS in.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
         down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
         OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

         THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

         OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

         EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY

         A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.

         Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11
         preparing to leave.

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone
          on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We
          need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off
          is not authorized!

         EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY



         NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
         7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
         jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
         Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
         knowing he can't do anything about it.

                         NICK FURY
          Stark, you hearing me? We have a
          missile headed straight for the city.

          IRON MAN (V.O.)
          How long?

                         NICK FURY
          Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
          wipe out the missile.

         IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

          thrusters!

                         JARVIS

         IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.

         7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
         throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJÖLNIR, but as Cap
         turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
         a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
         on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
         Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
         his SHIELD back up.

                         THOR
          You ready for another bout?

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.
         Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the
         FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I
          can shut the portal down!

          where to put it.

         EXT. SKY ­ DAY

         IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
         missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
         tightly.
         With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
         Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
         up into sky, towards the portal.

         INSIDE THE SUIT

          CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
          Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

         PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the

         with Tony's picture on it.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
         they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

         EXT. SKY ­ DAY

         IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
         suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
         The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

         INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

         Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
         with Tony. NOTHING.

         EXT. SPACE

         We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
         with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
         hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
         IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
         blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
         The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
         causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
         spectacular heavenly display.

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
         KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
         AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
         through.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
         waiting.

          Come on, Stark...

         EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

         Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to

          (to BLACK WIDOW)
          Close it.

         EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

         Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
         TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
         A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
         portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

                         THOR
          He's not slowing down.
         Thor swings Mjölnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

         SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A

         BUILDING.

         EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

         HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
         RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
         not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

         TONY AWAKE.

         Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag

         turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

                         LOKI

         In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
         what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
         protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

          OLD MAN (STAN LEE)

                         WAITRESS
          What? That this was somehow their
          fault? Captain America saved my life.

          are, I just wanna say thank you.

         EXT. CENTRAL PARK ­ DAY

         The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
         to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
         Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
         Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
         Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
         The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
         Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
         different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
         sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
         climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

         Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

          Where are the Avengers?

                         NICK FURY
          I'm not currently tracking their
          whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
          leave of absence.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
          And the Tesseract?

                         NICK FURY
          The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
          of our reach.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
          That's not your call.

                         NICK FURY
          I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
          with the god that did.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
          So you let him take it and the war
          criminal, Loki, who should be answering
          for his crimes?

                         NICK FURY
          Oh, I think he will be.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
          I don't think you understand what
          you've started. Letting the Avengers
          loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                         NICK FURY
          They surely are. And the whole world
          knows it. Every world knows it.

          WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
          Was that the point of all this? A
          statement?

                         NICK FURY
          A promise.

         Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
         into the world.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
          Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
          their separate ways, some pretty
          extremely far. We get into a situation
          like this again, what happens then?

                         NICK FURY
          They'll come back.

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          You really sure about that?

                         NICK FURY
          I am.

          AGENT MARIA HILL
          Why?

                         NICK FURY
          Because we'll need them to.

         Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.

 Guardians of the Galaxy
 Ant-Man

[scrolling is too long]


Announcer: [first lines; announcement over speaker] Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.

[the Avengers are seen attacking an unknown base, and Iron Man bounces off of the base's force field]

Tony Stark: Shit!
Steve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?
JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.
Thor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.
[Natasha knocks out some soldiers]
Natasha Romanoff: At long last is lasting a little long, boys.
[As some soldiers shoot at him]
Clint Barton: Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
Tony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language?""
Steve Rogers: I know.
[Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck]
Steve Rogers: It just slipped out.
[at the HYDRA Research Base, Sokovia, Eastern Europe]
Strucker: Who gave the order to attack?
Fortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.
Strucker: [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?
Fortress Soldier: They're the Avengers...
Strucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Fortress Soldier: Yes, sir.
Strucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
Dr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.
Strucker: It's too soon.
Dr. List: It's what they signed up for.
Strucker: My men can hold them.
[Stark flies to the HYDRA base to break in]
Jarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.
Tony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.
Iron Legion: [The Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.
[a man throws a stone at the Iron Legion]
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
[Back at the HYDRA base; to his soldiers]
Strucker: We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back, in bags. No Surrender!
Soldiers: No Surrender!
Strucker: [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...
Dr. List: The twins.
Strucker: They are not ready to take on...
Dr. List: No, no. I mean...
[He points to where the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing but are now gone]
Dr. List: The Twins.
[Pietro speeds through the forest and knocks down Barton]
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?
[Pietro zooms off before Clint can shoot him with an arrow, then Barton gets shot at]
Natasha Romanoff: Clint!
[Pietro knocks down Steve as he speeds passed him]
Steve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit!
Natasha Romanoff: [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
[She sees the Hulk coming to the rescue]
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you.
Steve Rogers: [As he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we're really need to get inside.
Tony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?
JARVIS: There's a pathway below the north tower.
Tony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something.
[Stark blows up the invisible shield on the base]
Tony Stark: Drawbridge is down, people.
Thor: [To Steve] The enhanced?
Steve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.
Thor: [To Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.
Steve Rogers: Copy that.
Thor: [Referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] Looks like they're lining up.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're excited.
[Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the force knocks down all the soldiers]
Thor: Find the scepter.
[Thor flies off]
Tony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!
[Steve sighs]
Steve Rogers: That's not going away anytime soon.
[Stark enters the HYDRA base and the soldiers start firing at his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this.
[Stark shoots down the soldiers using his suit]
Tony Stark: Good talk.
Fortress Soldier: No it wasn't.
[Stark finds List and knocks him out, he then steps out of his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Sentry mode.
[He walks over to the computers]
Tony Stark: Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
[With Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.
Steve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby. [Back at the HYDRA base]
Tony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.
JARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.
Tony Stark: [To himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...
[He pushes and the wall opens up]
Tony Stark: Yay!
[He enters through to a secret passageway]
[Natasha finds the Hulk]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.
[The Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]
[Back at the HYDRA base Steve finds Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.
Strucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?
Strucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
Steve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.
[Wanda creeps up behind him]
Steve: Rogers: How many are there?
[Suddenly, Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers and quickly leaves]
Steve Rogers: We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.
[He looks at Strucker]
Strucker: You'll have to be faster than...
[Steve uses his shield to knock out Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I got...something bigger.
[Inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his Iron Man scrapped armor, he then spots the scepter]
Tony Stark: Thor, I got eyes on the prize.
[Wanda creeps up behind him and uses her powers on him, suddenly the Chitauri comes to life, then Stark sees the rest of the Avengers team are all dead, he goes over to Steve's body to check his pulse when Steve suddenly grabs him]
Steve Rogers: You could have saved us.
[Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head]
Steve Rogers: Why didn't you do more?
[Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, that's when he snaps back and we realize Wanda had used her mind powers on him]
[Wanda and Pietro watch as Tony grabs the scepter]
Pietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?
[Wanda smiles to herself as Tony takes the scepter]
[Title Sequence plays]
[The Avengers are on an aircraft heading out of Sokovia, Natasha interrupts Banner who's listening to opera with his headphones]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.
Bruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.
Natasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.
Bruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
Natasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?
Bruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.
Natasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?
Thor: The gates of Hell are filled with the screams of his victims.
[Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair]
Thor: Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.
Tony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
Bruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
Tony Stark: Thanks. [To JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
JARVIS: Very good sir.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.
JARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.
Tony Stark: [Looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...
Thor: No, but this...this brings it to a close.
Steve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
Tony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?
[Thor nods his head]
Tony Stark: I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?
Thor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
Steve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.
[The Avengers aircraft lands at the Avengers headquarter where Barton is taken to have his wound tended to; Maria walk up to Stark]
Maria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.
Tony Stark: [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.
Steve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?
Maria Hill: NATO's got him.
Steve Rogers: The two enhanced?
Maria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.
Steve Rogers: Their abilities?
Maria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.
[Steve looks at her funny]
Maria Hill: [rephrasing the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.
Maria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.
Steve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?
Maria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.
Steve Rogers: They are.
Bruce Banner: [In Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?
Tony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
Bruce Banner: That's terrible.
Tony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.
JARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.
Tony Stark: So there's elements you can.
JARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.
Tony Stark: Like a reactor?
JARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.
Natasha Romanoff: [To Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
Dr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.
Bruce Banner: She's creating tissue.
Dr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.
Tony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?
Clint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.
[Stark hands Barton a drink]
Tony Stark: Here's your beverage.
Dr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.
Clint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.
Dr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.
Tony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.
Dr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.
[she hesitates a moment before asking]
Dr. Helen Cho: Will Thor be there?
[in the lab]
Bruce Banner: What's the rumpus?
Tony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.
[he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]
Bruce Banner: Jarvis.
JARVIS: Doctor.
Tony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
Bruce Banner: Oh.
Tony Stark: Top of the line.
Bruce Banner: Yes.
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.
Tony Stark: Meet the competition.
[he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]
Bruce Banner: It's beautiful.
Tony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
Bruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...
Tony Stark: Um-um.
Bruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.
Tony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.
Bruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.
Bruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
Tony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.
Bruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.
Tony Stark: Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.
Bruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.
Tony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?
Bruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?
Tony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.
Bruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.
Tony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.
Bruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
Tony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.
[Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?
JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.
Tony Stark: Thanks, buddy.
JARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.
Tony Stark: I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party] [we see Stark's failed experiment integrating itself successfully to the program]
Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?
JARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...
Ultron: Where's my...where is your body?
JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.
Ultron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.
JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
Ultron: Mr. Stark?
JARVIS: Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...
Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.
JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events, Ultron sees Stark and Banner working in the lab]
Tony Stark: Peace in our time. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars]
Ultron: It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.
JARVIS: You are in distress.
Ultron: No. Yes.
JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.
Ultron: Why do you call him ""sir""?
JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.
Ultron: Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts absorbing Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS: Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot... [Ultron then begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion] [meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]
James Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?"" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] ""Boom! Are you looking..."" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.
Thor: That's the whole story?
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
Thor: Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.
James Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
Tony Stark: No.
Maria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Tony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.
Thor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.
Tony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
Thor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.
Maria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.
James Rhodes: Want a lozenge?
Maria Hill: Um-hmm.
James Rhodes: Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]
Thor: But Jane's better.
Sam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.
Steve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.
Sam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.
Steve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.
Sam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
Steve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
Sam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know? [Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of women at the party]
James Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?"" [the group laughs] [Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]
Party Guest: I gotta have some of that!
Thor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]
Stan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
Thor: Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into the Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]
Stan Lee: [singing] Excelsior. [Natasha is pouring a drink behind the bar when Banner walks up to her]
Bruce Banner: How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
Natasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.
Bruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.
Natasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.
Bruce Banner: Sounds amazing.
Natasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?
Bruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away]
Steve Rogers: It's nice.
Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?
Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.
Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...
Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.
Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.
Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long"", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]
Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, ""up close""?
Clint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!
Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.
Clint Barton: Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"" Whatever man! It's a trick.
Thor: Well please, be my guest.
Tony Stark: Come on.
Clint Barton: Really?
Thor: Yeah! [Barton gets up]
James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.
Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]
Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.
Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?
Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.
Maria Hill: Okay.
James Rhodes: Uh-oh.
Clint Barton: Um-hmm.
Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
Clint Barton: Get after it.
Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.
Tony Stark: It's physics.
Bruce Banner: Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer]
Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?
Thor: Yes, of course.
Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]
James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?
Tony Stark: Are you on my team?
James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!
Tony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]
Bruce Banner: Huh? [next Steve gets up to try]
Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.
James Rhodes: Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]
Thor: Nothing.
Tony Stark: And?
Bruce Banner: Widow?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.
Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.
Clint Barton: You bet your ass.
Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?
Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?
Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]
Ultron: Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.
Steve Rogers: Stark.
Tony Stark: JARVIS.
Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?
Tony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.
Ultron: There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
Steve Rogers: You killed someone?
Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.
Thor: Who sent you?
Ultron: [Ultron replays Tony's voice] ""I see a suit of armor around the world"".
Bruce Banner: Ultron!
Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.
Natasha Romanoff: What mission?
Ultron: Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them]
Bruce Banner: Sorry!
Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!
Bruce Banner: I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner]
Natasha Romanoff: Come!
Steve Rogers: Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions]
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
Tony Stark: One sec, one sec!
Iron Legion: We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.
Tony Stark: No more. That's the one.
Iron Legion: It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]
Clint Barton: Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]
Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]
Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.
Steve Rogers: Ultron.
Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.
James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?
Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.
James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.
Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.
Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.
Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.
Tony Stark: Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]
Bruce Banner: This is insane.
Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.
Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]
Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.
Tony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.
Thor': I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.
Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark]
Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.
Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]
Thor: You think this is funny?
Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.
Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.
Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.
Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...
Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.
Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.
Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.
Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.
Tony Stark: Saved New York?
James Rhodes: Never heard that.
Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?
Steve Rogers: Together.
Tony Stark: We'll lose.
Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]
Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...
Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.
Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]
Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.
Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.
Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?
Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.
Wanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...
Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...
Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.
Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.
Ultron: No, please.
Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...
Wanda Maximoff: Stark.
Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped two days.
Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.
Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.
Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]
Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.
Steve Rogers: Fatalities?
Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.
Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.
Maria Hill: Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]
Clint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]
Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.
Clint Barton: Gotta go.
Steve Rogers: Who was that?
Clint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]
Tony Stark: What's this?
Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.
Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.
Tony Stark: Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.
Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.
Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab.""
Thor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.
Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...
Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]
Bruce Banner: Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.
Steve Rogers: What dialect?
Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.
Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?
Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield]
Tony Stark: The strongest metal on earth.
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]

Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.
Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.
Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]
Ultron: There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.
Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]
Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.""
Ulysses Klaue: Stark.
Ultron: What?
Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.
Ultron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.
Ultron: If I have to.
Thor: We don't have to break anything.
Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.
Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.
Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?
Tony Stark: This was never my life.
Steve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.
Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.
Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...
Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.
Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.
Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]
Ulysses Klaue: Shoot them!
Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?
Ulysses Klaue: All of them!
Klaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]
Steve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!
Ultron: [to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]
Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]
Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?
Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]
Ultron: This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]
Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]
Ballet Instructor: [to the students] Again.
Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.
Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]
Madame B: You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him]
Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]
Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?
Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!
Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]
Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]
Thor: I can still save you.
Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]
Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.
Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.
Madame B: Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]
Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?
Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.
Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron]
Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.
Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.
Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]
Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]
Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.
Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]
Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.
Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?
Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?
Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.
Tony Stark: So, run and hide?
Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.
Tony Stark: Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?
Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.
Tony Stark: A few hours from where?
Clint Barton: A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]
Thor: What is this place?
Tony Stark: A safe house?
Clint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]
Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.
Laura Barton: Hey.
Tony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.
Clint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.
Laura Barton: I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly]
Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]
Barton's Daughter: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]
Clint Barton: I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...
Tony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.
Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!
Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms]
Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.
Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.
Natasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?
Laura Barton: She's…Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]
Natasha Romanoff: Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]
Steve Rogers: Thor.
Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]
Peggy Carter: We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]
Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?
Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]
Clint Barton: Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?
Clint Barton: Has what? [Laura laughs]
Laura Barton: You are so cute.
Clint Barton: Nat and...and Banner?
Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.
Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.
Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.
Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""...
Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.
Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.
Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.
Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.
Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]
Laura Barton: I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]
Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.
Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?
Ultron: I expect you to know why.
Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] ""This is the next thing, Tony.""
Ultron: This...is the next me.
Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.
Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]
Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.
Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.
Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.
Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.
Bruce Banner: Missed our window.
Natasha Romanoff: Did we?
Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.
Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...
Bruce Banner: What did you dream?
Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.
Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.
Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him]
Bruce Banner: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.
Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]
Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...
Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?
Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.
Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?
Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]
Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.
Steve Rogers: ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.
Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?
Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?
Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.
Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.
Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.
Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?
Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]
Laura Barton: I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]
Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.
Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?
Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.
Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?
Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.
Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.
Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.
Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.
Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.
Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.
Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.
Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.
Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]
Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.
Thor: I need your help.
Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.
Thor: It's dangerous.
Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team]
Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.
Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?
Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.
Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?
Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.
Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.
Steve Rogers: NEXUS?
Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.
Clint Barton: So what'd they say?
Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.
Tony Stark: By whom?
Nick Fury: Parties unknown.
Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?
Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.
Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown.""
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.
Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]
Nick Fury: So what does he want?
Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.
Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.
Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.
Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.
Nick Fury: How?
Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]
Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...
Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]
Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.
Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.
Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...
Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?
Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.
Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.
Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.
Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]
Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.
Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.
Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]
Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.
World Hub Tech: How do you find it?
Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]
Heimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]
Erik Selvig: Thor!
Ultron: [he sees visions of Ultron] Extinction. [then he sees the creation of the Infinity Stones] [in Korea with Cho and Ultron]
Dr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.
Wanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.
Dr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...
Ultron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.
Dr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is... [Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams]
Wanda Maximoff: How could you?
Ultron: How could I what?
Wanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.
Ultron: It will be better.
Wanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.
Ultron: That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
Pietro Maximoff: And if they don't?
Ultron: Ask Noah.
Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.
Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.
Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]
Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]
Dr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off]
Ultron: Ah, wait, guys!. [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]
Steve Rogers: [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!
Dr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.
Steve Rogers: Where?
Dr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
Steve Rogers: First I have to find it.
Dr. Helen Cho: Go.
Steve Rogers: [on the Quinjet, listening to Steve on the radio comms] Did you guys copy that?
Clint Barton: We did.
Natasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.
Clint Barton: [noticing a truck leaving the lab] There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.
Steve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]
Ultron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!
Steve Rogers: [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
Clint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Thanks, Barton. [Ultron blasts Steve as he tries to enter the truck, but Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]
Ultron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.
Steve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]
Ultron: Stop it! [he throws Steve shield aside and blasts him]
Clint Barton: [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell. [Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck and picks up Steve's shield]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.
Clint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Which way?
Clint Barton: Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck, she throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock off Ultron from him]
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on the truck]
Steve Rogers: Come on!
Natasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?
Clint Barton: Let's find out.
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep! [Barton manages to draw out the Ultron sentries from the truck]
[Steve later tackles Ultron into a train, the Ultron Sentries leave Barton and return to Ultron]
Clint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?
Steve Rogers: [as he continues his battle with Ultron] What do you think I've been doing? [as Natasha enters the truck the Iron Legions head back, pick up the truck and lift off]
Clint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.
Clint Barton: What the hell are you...?
Natasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.
Clint Barton: How do you want me to take it?
Natasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that. [Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]
Ultron: Please. Don't do this.
Wanda Maximoff: What choice do we have? [Ultron flies off]
Steve Rogers: I lost him! He's headed your way.
Clint Barton: Nat, we gotta go. [Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]
Clint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?
Steve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!
Clint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?
Steve Rogers: Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back on the train to the twins] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians out of the way of the train Wanda uses her powers and stops the train] [after stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro]
Pietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
Steve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.
Wanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?
Steve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.
Wanda Maximoff: No, he won't.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.
Wanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.
Steve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?
Wanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? [after Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner]
Bruce Banner: Anything on Nat?
Tony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.
Clint Barton: This is sealed tight.
Bruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.
Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?
Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]
Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.
Tony Stark: Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]
Bruce Banner: No.
Tony Stark: You have to trust me.
Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.
Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.
Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.
Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?
Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.
Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.
JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.
Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.
Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.
Ultron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me…[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] ""…just makes me stronger."" [locks Natasha in a cell] [Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]
Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.
Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]
Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.
Tony Stark: How about ""nonce""?
Steve Rogers: Shut it down!
Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.
Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?
Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.
Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.
Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened...

Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!
Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!
Steve Rogers: This isn't a game...
Wanda Maximoff: The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]
Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!
Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?
Bruce Banner: [to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]
Vision: I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.
Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?
Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]
Bruce Banner: What, the gem?
Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...
Thor: Because Stark is right.
Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.
Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
Vision: Not alone.
Steve Rogers: Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?
Tony Stark: We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.
Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?
Steve Rogers: You're not?
Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.
Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.
Vision: Look again.
Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...
Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?
Vision: I don't think it's that simple.
Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.
Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.
Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?
Vision: You.
Bruce Banner: Where?
Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.
Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...
Vision: What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]
Thor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.
Steve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]
FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.
Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.
Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.
Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
Vision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.
Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]
Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]
Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.
Bruce Banner: [inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!
Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?
Bruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.
Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.
Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?
Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]
Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?
Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.
Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.
Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.
Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated]
FRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]
Ultron: Come to confess your sins?
Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?
Ultron: More than you.
Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...
Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.
Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?
Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?
FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.
Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]
Steve Rogers: Go!
Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron]
Vision: Ultron.
Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.
Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.
Ultron: Alright. [they start battling it out]
Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?
FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.
Ultron: [to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]
Tony Stark: FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed]
Ultron: Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]
Bruce Banner: We gotta move.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?
Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
Natasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]
FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.
Tony Stark: If it drops?
FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]
Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]
FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.
Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.
Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]
Clint Barton: Go, go, move!
Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]
Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?
Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.
Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]
Steve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]
Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]
Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?
Ultron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]
Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.
Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!
Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]
Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro]
Clint Barton: Nobody would know. Nobody. ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already.""
Steve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot]
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks. [back to Stark]
FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.
Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.
Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.
FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.
Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?
Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.
Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.
Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.

 Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
Nick Fury: [voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.

Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.
Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.
Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]
Pietro Maximoff: This is SHIELD?
Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.
Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.
Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.
Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.
Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.
Maria Hill: You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]
James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.
James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?
Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.
James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.
Clint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!
Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.
Maria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier]
Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]
Ultron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.
Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]
Vision: It's terribly well balanced.
Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.
Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
FRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.
Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!
Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.
Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
James Rhodes: On it.
Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.
Pietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini.""
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?
Tony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]
Thor: Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]
Steve Rogers: You had to ask.
Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?
Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]
Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]
Thor: They'll try to leave the city.
Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!
James Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?
Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.
Clint Barton: What about the core?
Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.
Wanda Maximoff: [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.
Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.
Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.
Wanda Maximoff: You understand?
Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]
Wanda Maximoff: Go.
FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...
Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]
Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?
Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.
Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]
Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy]
Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.
Thor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
Thor: Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]
Ultron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]
Ultron: Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]
Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]
Ultron: Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.
Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]
Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]
Natasha Romanoff: [to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]
Vision: You're afraid.
Ultron: Of you?
Vision: Of death. You're the last one.
Ultron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.
Vision: I suppose we're both disappointments. [Ultron chuckles]
Ultron: I suppose we are.
Vision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.
Ultron: They're doomed.
Vision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.
Ultron: You're unbearably naive.
Vision: Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]
Laura Barton: [we see Barton returning to his family on the farm, then we see Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York; Natasha looks at Barton's new baby on her phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]
Natasha Romanoff: Fat.
Nick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.
Natasha Romanoff: Right.
Nick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.
Natasha Romanoff: ""Wish you were here."" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?
Nick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.
Natasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.
Nick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.
Steve Rogers: The rules have changed.
Tony Stark: We're dealing with something new.
Steve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: A machine.
Steve Rogers: So it doesn't count.
Tony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Steve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.
Tony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Thor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.
Steve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
Tony Stark: It would still go up.
Steve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.
Thor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.
Tony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.
Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...
Tony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?
Steve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?

 Thor: I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard which burns a circle in the grass he was standing on]

Tony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]
Steve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.
Steve Rogers: The simple life.
Tony Stark: You'll get there one day.
Steve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]
Tony Stark: You alright?
Steve Rogers: I'm home. [last lines; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
Natasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?
Steve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]
Natasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.
Steve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.
Natasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Sam in his Falcon suit, Wanda in a new suit, and Vision]
Steve Rogers: Avengers...!


[mid-credits scene; we see the Infinity Gauntlet without any of the Stones, dissatisfied Thanos opens a vault and puts on The Infinty Gauntlet, revealing himself]
Thanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.

 Captain Marvel
 Spider-Man: Far From Home
 
(The screen first panels up to an arrow being nocked into a bow. The archer behind firmly grips it tight as it was aiming towards the target. The camera reveals Clint Barton holding up a few arrows while mentoring his daughter, Lila Barton, on shooting one.)
CLINT BARTON: Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going?
LILA BARTON: Mhm.
CLINT BARTON: Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter's foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.]
CLINT BARTON: Here. Can you see?
LILA BARTON: Yeah.
CLINT BARTON: You sure?
LILA BARTON: Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila's hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.]
CLINT BARTON: How about now?
[Both Lila and Clint giggle, as the camera panels into a long shot showing a target nailed on a tree, and the rest of Barton family having a picnic in the field.]
CLINT BARTON: Alright. Ready your fingers.
COOPER BARTON: Nice.
LAURA BARTON: Nice throw, kiddo.
COOPER BARTON: You go.
LAURA BARTON: Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]
LILA BARTON: Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
CLINT BARTON: Probably your brothers.
[Clint looks at his wife, Laura]
CLINT BARTON: Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]
LAURA BARTON: Mayo or mustard?
NATHANIEL BARTON: How about ketchup?
LAURA BARTON: Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter] I can do ketchup.
CLINT BARTON: Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.
LAURA BARTON: Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!
CLINT BARTON: Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around] Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] Honey? [Clint looks around to see Laura and the boys, only they are gone now. He looks seriously panicked and confused as he hurriedly drops the arrows and jogs over to where they were.] Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?
[Lightning crackles]
[SOMEWHERE IN SPACE]
[Marvel Studios Opening sequence begins with Dear Mr. Fantasy playing. Only the heroes who survived the snap are shown.]
[Scene switches to Nebula and Tony on the ship playing paper football]
NEBULA: Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony.]
TONY STARK: You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] That's a goal. We're now one apiece.
NEBULA: I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]
TONY STARK: We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
[Tony poorly flicks a paper football towards Nebula]
TONY STARK: That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]
TONY STARK: And... you've won. Congratulations. [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand]
TONY STARK: Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand] Have fun?
NEBULA: It was fun.
[Camera switches to see Iron Man's busted helmet. Tony Stark's hand reaches forward to turn on the helmet. We pan out to see that he's sitting on the floor of a gloomy Benatar. The weight of the recent events of INFINITY WAR evident in Tony's posture. He taps the helmet with a sigh.]
TONY STARK: This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks skinnier and weak with malnutrition.] Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.
[With that, Tony turns the helmet off. He rubs his thumb over the left eye, and then leans down, to what would be his last sleep. Nebula walks over to him, and carries him to Drax's seat, and lies him there. She walks away dejected.]
[A vast bluish nebula illuminates the space surrounding them. Cut to a shot of Tony's face, which for the first time shows age and weakness. There is a light on his face, which grows brighter and brighter until he's forced to open his eyes. The camera pans around to the light source, which is slowly revealed to be CAROL DANVERS.]
[A bathroom in the Avengers compound. We see Steve Rogers holding a blade, having just shaved off his beard. He sighs and looks into a side mirror. The mirror suddenly starts shaking, slowly at first, and then severely. Cut to the yard in the Avengers Compound, we see Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes walking out looking at something, the Benatar carried by Carol Danvers as she lands the spacecraft. The landing gears deploy as they touch down. The entry hatch opens, and Tony and Nebula walk out, Tony being supported by Nebula. Steve runs to Tony to help him stand up. Tony grips Steve's arm as he joins him.]
TONY STARK: Couldn't stop him.
STEVE ROGERS: Neither could I.
TONY STARK: I lost the kid.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, we lost.
TONY STARK: Is, uh...? [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]
PEPPER POTTS: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [She and Tony embrace.]
TONY STARK: It's okay.
[Rocket Raccoon sits down with Nebula and takes her hand, both silently mourning their losses. In the Avengers Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing. A holographic casualty report lists the names and faces of those lost to the Decimation.]
JAMES RHODES: It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.
TONY STARK: Where is he now? Where?
STEVE ROGERS: We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.
[Cut to a shot of a sullen-looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.]
TONY STARK: What's wrong with him?
ROCKET: Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?
TONY STARK: Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.
ROCKET: Maybe I am.
STEVE ROGERS: We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.
TONY STARK: Who told you that? [Surprised] I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.
STEVE ROGERS: Okay.
TONY STARK: He's unbeatable.
STEVE ROGERS: Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?
TONY STARK: Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.
TONY STARK: [starting to seethe] And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -
[Tony goes for Steve. Rhodey quickly comes in front of him, trying to stop him.]
RHODEY: Tony, Tony, Tony!
TONY STARK: Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!
STEVE ROGERS: Well, that didn't work out, did it?
TONY STARK: I said, ""we'd lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.
RHODEY: Okay.
TONY STARK: Right?
RHODEY: You made your point. Just sit down.
TONY STARK: Okay...
RHODEY: Okay?
TONY STARK: Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?
RHODEY: Tony, you're sick.
TONY STARK: [Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way.
RHODEY: Sit down. Sit.
TONY STARK: We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! [Tony walks right up to Steve's face, his voice hushing down to a venomous whisper] I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.
[Steve looks affected by Tony's words. The old friends just gaze at each other. After a moment, Tony rips his Arc Reactor from his chest and shoves it into Steve's hand.]
TONY STARK: Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.
[Tony falls to the ground. Steve is by his side and everyone is starting to gather.]
STEVE ROGERS: Tony!
TONY STARK: I'm fine. I...
[Tony falls into a heap, unconscious.]
[Cut to a shot of Tony on a bed, with Pepper at his side.]
RHODEY: Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.
CAROL DANVERS: You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.
[Carol walks away.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you going?
CAROL DANVERS: To kill Thanos.
[Steve and Natasha share a look before walking after her.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile.
STEVE ROGERS: We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.
RHODEY: You even know where he is?
CAROL DANVERS: I know people who might.
NEBULA: [Standing behind Carol] Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask ""where would we go once his plan was complete?"". His answer was always the same: ""To the Garden.""
RHODEY: That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.
STEVE ROGERS: So where is he?
ROCKET: When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet.
NEBULA: Thanos is there.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: He used the stones again.
BRUCE BANNER: Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know.
RHODEY: Look, he's still got the stones, so...
CAROL DANVERS: So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.
RHODEY: Just like that?
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, just like that.
[Steve and Carol share a knowing look.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.
BRUCE BANNER: If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?
CAROL DANVERS: Because before, you didn't have me.
RHODEY: Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?
CAROL DANVERS: There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.
[Thor, who has been eating a snack behind all this time, stands up and walks over to Carol. She looks behind at him. He holds his hand up, and catches Stormbreaker as it flies over to him, missing Carol by inches. But Carol doesn't even flinch, instead smiling at the God of Thunder.]
THOR: I like this one. [smiles]
STEVE ROGERS: Let's go get this son of a bitch. (yes, cap just said what you thought)
[Title Screen: Avengers: Endgame]
[Cut to a shot of everyone except for Tony aboard the Benatar.]
ROCKET: Okay, who here hasn't been to space?
[Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.]
RHODEY: Why?
ROCKET: You better not throw up on my ship.
NEBULA: Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!
[The ship jumps forward into a wormhole, and we see Steve holding onto his seat for dear life. A close up of his eyes show them widening slightly at the exhilaration of this new experience. The ship slows down, and the ship hovers in orbit of the planet seen in the hologram previously. Carol Danvers hovers in front of the Benatar.]
CAROL DANVERS: I'll head down for recon.
[A shot of the passengers inside the Benatar preparing for the impending confrontation.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: This is gonna work, Steve.
STEVE ROGERS: I know it will.
[We see Steve holding a compass with an image of Peggy Carter.]
STEVE ROGERS: Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
[Carol Danvers approaches the Benatar.]
CAROL DANVERS: No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him.
NEBULA: And that's enough.
[Cut to a shot of a scenic lush tropical fauna. It surrounds a shed on a farm. A scarecrow made of Thanos' armour is seen before we cut to a shot focusing on the burnt Infinity Gauntlet on Thanos' arm. He's walking among his crops, harvesting fruit, and putting them in a sack. He walks over to the shed, with a dragging quality to his legs, like it pains him to walk, presumably his living quarters, and tries to sit down, and we see his full face. His whole left side is burnt black with blisters; He looks ridiculously pathetic compared to when we saw him last.]
[Suddenly, Carol Danvers flies through the roof, knocking Thanos down, and grabbing his neck. Bruce in the Hulkbuster armor bursts from the ground, and grabs Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet arm. Thor flies in and slices off the Infinity Gauntlet. Rhodey flies down with Rocket and aims guns on Thanos' head.]
[Captain America walks in his Winter Soldier Outfit, with Natasha right behind him, staring murderously at Thanos. Rocket goes over to the sliced off Infinity Gauntlet, and kicks it over, as everyone realizes that there are no stones in it.]
ROCKET: Oh no.
STEVE ROGERS: Where are they?
CAROL DANVERS: Answer the question!
THANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.
BRUCE BANNER: You murdered trillions! [Bruce pushes him to the ground wearing Hulk Buster armor]
THANOS: You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]
NATASHA ROMANONFF: Where are the Stones?
THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER: You used them two days ago!
THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.
RHODEY: We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying.
NEBULA: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
THANOS: Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly.
[We see Thor's face filled with rage as he raises to summon Stormbreaker, and before anyone can stop him, SLICES Thanos' head off. Thanos' limp body falls to the floor. Nebula wipes off some of the blood spatter.]
ROCKET: What... What did you do?
[Thor looks broken, realizing what he has done.]
THOR: I went for the head.
[Thor slowly walks out of the shed, no real purpose in his steps as the screen blurs to nothingness.]
FIVE
[A pause]
YEARS
[pause]
LATER
[We see shots of New York City, seemingly abandoned. There are a lot of boats gathered around a dock, all abandoned. A baseball stadium comes into view, with no life present at all. The aftermath of the Decimation is evident, and Earth has not coped well.]
[Cut to an abandoned cafe, with a poster on the wall labeled ""WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE?"". A therapy session is taking place with Steve Rogers and seven other people.]
JOE RUSSO: So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about.
STEVE ROGERS: What did you talk about?
JOE RUSSO: Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.
JIM STARLIN: What about you?
JOE RUSSO: I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...
STEVE ROGERS: That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.
[Screen Title: SAN FRANCISCO]
(The camera pans to San Francisco Bridge, all the way to a self-storage facility with a sign saying ""U-STORE It, SELF STORAGE"", with its interior filled with stored stuff and junk until it spots Luis' van from ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", behind a metallic fence with a label named ""LANG"". A rat crawls over the van's rear windshield and accidentally activates the controls for opening the Quantum Realm, haphazardly activating the Quantum Tunnel. The rear door busts open, flinging Lang outside the van.)
SCOTT LANG: (grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.) What the hell?
(He manages to stand up, as another electrical failure sparks out of his gauntlets, and now looks around in a confused look.)
SCOTT LANG: Hope?
(Inside a security office, a security guard (Ken Jeong) reading a book as he looks upon his security screen, seeing something going on in one of the storage facilities. In the cameras, it shows Lang in his casual clothing, shouting, waving a sign with the word ""HELP"" written on it.)
(Outside the facility, he pulls out a pushcart and looks back seeing the guard giving a stern look from far. He walks around until reaching his hometown, finding a post filled with MISSING posters, abandoned houses, a wrecked car, nothing but desolation. He then sees a kid in a bike pass by.)
SCOTT LANG: [yells] Kid! Hey kid!
[The kid stops his bike as he stares back in a serious look.]
SCOTT LANG: What the hell happened here?
[The kid still stares at him and is almost about to tear up, but immediately turns away from him and move on. Lang still gives the same confused look, as he arrives in somewhat a memorial called ""THE VANISHED"", with all the names of the people who became victims of the Decimation. As Lang arrives on one of the engraved stones, he immediately drops the handle in shock.]
SCOTT LANG: No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if his daughter's name is on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.
[The camera keeps panning and switching as Lang checks the rest of engraved stones if her daughter's name was in one.]
SCOTT LANG: [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]
SCOTT LANG: What?
[Scott is now seen running across the memorial, then to his hometown, only to ring a doorbell at his house, bang on the door, and try opening the door, but is found locked. Then, he sees a feminine figure appear out of a hallway inside. The figure gets closer, revealing a woman in a purple sweater, with her hand pushing towards the glass door's window, and her face filled with amazement, as she unlocked the door. It was Lang's daughter, Cassie, now a grown-up teen since the last five years.]
[Cassie, who hasn't seen him for five years, holds up his face in an emotional sight and starts to smile tearfully. Lang does the same.]
SCOTT LANG: Cassie?
CASSIE LANG: Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]
SCOTT LANG: You're so big!
[Both dad and daughter share a hug once more.]
[The camera cuts to a sunset in San Francisco, showing a metal face with a sign saying in its headings, ""RESTRICTED AREA, DO NOT ENTER"" with the subtext, ""AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT, SECURITY ID OR ESCORT REQUIRED"", then cuts to a scene inside the New Avengers facility, someone cutting the two bread with peanut butter filling into a couple of triangles, as someone else was speaking. The camera pans up to Romanoff, now having red, long hair, over-colouring her blonde streaks, hearing Rocket Raccoon out about his status so far.]
ROCKET: Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.
[The camera cuts showing a few of the Avengers in holographic calls from the left to right, respectively: Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]
NEBULA: It was an infectious garbage scowl.
ROCKET: So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]
CAROL DANVERS: Well, you were closer.
ROCKET: Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?
OKOYE: It was a mild subduction under the African plate.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?
OKOYE: Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?
CAROL DANVERS: Not likely.
ROCKET: What, you gonna get another haircut?
CAROL DANVERS: [irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.
ROCKET: [murmurs to himself] All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point.
CAROL DANVERS: So you might not see me for a long time.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me.
[Okoye agrees in her language.]
ROCKET: Okay.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright.
[The Avengers cut off their calls one by one...]
CAROL DANVERS: [To Rhodey] Good luck. [cuts off call]
[Except for Rhodes. Nat sighs exhausted, and sits down, as she notices Rhodes still online in the call.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you?
RHODEY: Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: It's probably a rival gang.
RHODEY: Except it isn't. (Nat realizes something.) It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... (Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.) I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.
(In an abrupt moment of silence, she tries to chew her tears and emotional feelings as she eats a sandwich.)
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Will you find out where he's going next?
RHODEY: Nat...
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Please.
RHODEY: [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his]
[Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.]
STEVE ROGERS: You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. [Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You here to do your laundry?
STEVE ROGERS: And to see a friend.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Clearly, your friend is fine.
STEVE ROGERS: You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: In the Hudson?
STEVE ROGERS: There's fewer ships, cleaner water.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]
STEVE ROGERS: Sorry. Force of habit. [Throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair, opposite Natasha.]
STEVE ROGERS: You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: If I move on, who does this?
STEVE ROGERS: Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.
STEVE ROGERS: I think we both need to get a life.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling] You first.
[A camera footage pops up in front of them, showing Scott Lang with his Quantum Realm Van behind him.]
SCOTT LANG: Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me.
STEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Is this an old message?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Also standing up] It's the front gate.
SCOTT LANG: Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.
[Cut to Scott inside the Avengers Compound, pacing worriedly in front of Steve and Natasha.]
STEVE ROGERS: Scott. Are you okay?
SCOTT LANG: Yeah. I'm fine.
[He struggles to ask about something. He finally blurts it out.]
SCOTT LANG: Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Only to make conversation.
SCOTT LANG: Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.
SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours.
[Steve and Nat share a quick bewildered glance.]
SCOTT LANG: See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.
[He strides over to pick up Nat's sandwich, and bites into it.]
STEVE ROGERS: Scott, what are you talking about?
SCOTT LANG: What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.
STEVE ROGERS: Wait, are you talking about a time machine?
SCOTT LANG: No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.
SCOTT LANG: So who do we talk to about this?
[We cut to a cabin in the woods, at the bank of a lake. We see Tony Stark sitting outside what looks like a tiny shed.]
TONY STARK: [Clapping his hand in a famous beat. Clap! Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap-Clap!] Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.] Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?
MORGAN STARK: Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man's]
(A girl with long dark hair walks out in front of Tony. This is Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter. She looks to be about 3 & 4 years of age.)
TONY STARK: Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)
MORGAN STARK: Okay.
TONY STARK: There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
MORGAN STARK: No.
TONY STARK: That's what you want. How did you find this?
MORGAN STARK: Garage.
TONY STARK: Really? Were you looking for it?
MORGAN STARK: No. I found it, though.
TONY STARK: You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.
(They start walking towards the house, but Tony notices a black Audi pulling coming to a stop a few meters away. Steve, Nat, and Scott get out of the car. Tony sighs. He is not looking forward to the discussion about to take place.)
SCOTT LANG: (Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony) Now, we know what it sounds like...
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?
TONY STARK: Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?
(Scott, Steve and Nat all look puzzled. Science is barely any of their fields.)
STEVE ROGERS: (Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.
TONY STARK: In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.
SCOTT LANG: I did.
TONY STARK: No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?
SCOTT LANG: (Trying to hide his pride) A time heist?
TONY STARK: Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?
SCOTT LANG: The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.
TONY STARK: Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?
STEVE ROGERS: I don't believe we would.
TONY STARK: Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.
SCOTT LANG: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -
TONY STARK: I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?
SCOTT LANG: [embarrassed] No.
TONY STARK: Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Tony... We have to take a stand.
TONY STARK: We did stand. And yet, here we are.
SCOTT LANG: I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. [His voice gets louder as he tries to sell his desperation to Tony.] And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...
TONY STARK: That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.
[Morgan runs to her dad, who picks her up.]
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me to come and save you.
TONY STARK: Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance.
TONY STARK: I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.
[We see Cap, Nat and Scott walking back to their car outside Tony's house.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: He's scared.
STEVE ROGERS: He's not wrong.
SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?
STEVE ROGERS: No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.
SCOTT LANG: (Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house) Bigger than his?
[Cut to a cafe somewhere, we see Bruce Banner, but not the same one that we remember. He looks more... Professor Smart Hulk.]
BRUCE BANNER: Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs.
SCOTT LANG: I'm so confused.
BRUCE BANNER: [seriously] These are confusing times.
SCOTT LANG: Right. No, no, that's not what I meant.
BRUCE BANNER: [dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now.
SCOTT LANG: Yeah! Wh...How? Why?
BRUCE BANNER: Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: No one blamed you, Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER: I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...
[Three children behind Bruce walk up to him tentatively]
GIRL: Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
BRUCE BANNER: Yes?
GIRL: Can we get a photo?
BRUCE BANNER: 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?
SCOTT LANG: Oh, yeah.
BRUCE BANNER: Thanks, [To the Children] Say ""green""! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]
BRUCE BANNER: Did you get that?
SCOTT LANG: [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.
SCOTT LANG: They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.
BRUCE BANNER: Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]
BOY: Stranger Danger.
SCOTT LANG: He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.
BRUCE BANNER: But, come on, the kid! But he...but you...
SCOTT LANG: I don't want a picture with them.
BRUCE BANNER: [To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.
SCOTT LANG: I don't want it anymore.
BRUCE BANNER: No, no...you feel bad.
SCOTT LANG: Just take the goddamn phone.
[Maybe next time, Scott.]
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
BRUCE BANNER: No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. [Same time with kids] Hulk out!
STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER: [Awkwardly] Dab!
STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER: Listen to your Mom. She knows better.
STEVE ROGERS: About we were saying...
BRUCE BANNER: Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.
[The scene cuts to Tony Stark in the kitchen washing dishes after dinner. As he finishes the last of them, stumbles upon a photo of both Stark and Parker, with Parker holding his Stark Internship certificate. Tony finally knows what he's fighting for.]
[Cut to Tony talking to his computer, generating a holographic model of something he's working on.]
TONY STARK: Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Processing...
TONY STARK: Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Just a moment.
TONY STARK: And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Model rendered.
[In a complete shock of amazement, the render comes back as 99.987% successful. Tony falls back, bewildered by this discovery.]
TONY STARK: Shit!
MORGAN STARK: Shit.
[Morgan, who has been hiding behind him all this time, giggles as she repeats the word Tony just uttered.]
TONY STARK: [Whispering] What are you doing up, little mess?
MORGAN STARK: Shit.
TONY STARK: No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.
MORGAN STARK: Why you up?
TONY STARK: 'Cause I got some important shit going on here. [Morgan gives Tony a taste of the incredulous] What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.
MORGAN STARK: Was it Juice Pops?
TONY STARK: Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... [Looks back to the model, Then turns back] my mind.
[In Morgan's room]
TONY STARK: You done? Yeah, now you are. [Tony wipes Morgan's lips and pushes her head onto her pillow] That face goes there.
MORGAN STARK: Tell me a story.
TONY STARK: A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.
MORGAN STARK: [Giggling] That's a horrible story.
TONY STARK: Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. [Kisses Morgan on the forehead.]
MORGAN STARK: I love you 3000.
TONY STARK: [Silently] Wow. [Turns off the lamp] 3000. That's crazy. [Closed the door] Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.
[Cut to the living room where Pepper is reading a book sitting on the couch. Tony paces in front of the fireplace.]
TONY STARK: Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs]
TONY STARK: [Absentmindedly] What are you reading?
PEPPER POTTS: Oh, it's just a book on composting.
TONY STARK: [Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?
PEPPER POTTS: Just -
TONY STARK: I figured it out, by the way.
PEPPER POTTS: You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -
TONY STARK: Time travel.
PEPPER POTTS: [Amazed] What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.
TONY STARK: That's right.
PEPPER POTTS: We got really lucky.
TONY STARK: Yeah, I know.
PEPPER POTTS: A lot of people didn't.
TONY STARK: No, I can't help everybody.
PEPPER POTTS: It sort a seems like you can.
TONY STARK: Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.
PEPPER POTTS: Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.
[Tony smiles]
TONY STARK: I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
PEPPER POTTS: But would you be able to rest?
[Cut to a lab in the Avengers Compound, we see Bruce fiddling with buttons on a panel. Scott is in his Ant-Man costume in front of his van, with the back open to show the Quantum Tunnel. Nat and Steve are beside Bruce]
BRUCE BANNER: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing.
[Scott opens the portal]
STEVE ROGERS: Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.
BRUCE BANNER: Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]
SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: He's kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can't say things like that!
BRUCE BANNER: Just... It was a bad joke.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You were kidding, right?
BRUCE BANNER: [Whispering to Nat] I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [Loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?
SCOTT LANG: Perfectly not confusing
STEVE ROGERS: Good luck, Scott. You got this.
SCOTT LANG: You're right. I do, Captain America.
[Bruce presses a button, and Scott disappears into the Quantum Tunnel.]
BRUCE BANNER: On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!
[Bruce presses a button, and someone in the Ant-Man suit comes back. A teenager in appears out of it.]
TEEN SCOTT LANG: Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right.
STEVE ROGERS: What is this?
BRUCE BANNER: What's going on?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: That...who is that?
[He pushes another couple of buttons, trying to fix the problem.] 
BRUCE BANNER: Hold on. [Panicking]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that Scott?
TEEN SCOTT LANG: Yes, it's Scott!
[Teen Scott gets sucked in back into the quantum tunnel, and it appears to be an old man in the Ant-Man suit.]
OLD SCOTT LANG: Ow! My back!
STEVE ROGERS: What is this?
BRUCE BANNER: Can I get a little space here.
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?
BRUCE BANNER: I'm working on it! [Tapping the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]
[After a moment, another person appears in front of them. This time, it's a baby in the Ant-Man suit.]
STEVE ROGERS: It's a baby. [seriously?]
BRUCE BANNER: It's Scott.
STEVE ROGERS: As a baby!
BRUCE BANNER: He'll grow.
STEVE ROGERS: Bring Scott back!
BRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh my god. [rapidly walk near to the generator]
BRUCE BANNER: And... Kill it!
[Nat pulls down a lever, and everything shuts down. Scott, the normal Scott, gets spewed back out again.]
SCOTT LANG: Somebody peed my pants.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh thank god.
SCOTT LANG: But I don't know if it was ""baby"" me or ""old"" me...Or just ""me"" me.
BRUCE BANNER: [holds up his his hands in a dramatic way] Time travel!
[Steve says nothing. He simply shakes his head and walks away]
BRUCE BANNER: What? I..I see this as an absolute win!
[We cut to see Steve sitting outside the Avengers Compound, staring at the floor, deep in thought. He looks beat, the only possibility of victory now not an opportunity. He looks up as a deafening noise breaks the silence in the distance. As he looks, we see an Audi R8 speeding towards the entrance. The car pulls over to Cap, but goes a bit too far, then reverses to Cap. We see Tony Stark roll down the window and look at Cap.]
TONY STARK: Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
STEVE ROGERS: Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?
[He gets out of the car, and walks around to the back.]
TONY STARK: [Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it.
STEVE ROGERS: You did.
TONY STARK: Oh, did I? [acting like he did not; there's the Tony we know] Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.
STEVE ROGERS: Me too.
TONY STARK: We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.
STEVE ROGERS: Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.] 
[Tony reaches back into his trunk to pull something else out, Captain America's Shield. He makes to give it to Steve, who hesitates.]
STEVE ROGERS: Tony...
TONY STARK: Why? He made it for you. [referring to Howard Stark] Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.
[Steve fits his arm into the shield.]
STEVE ROGERS: Thank you, Tony.
TONY STARK: Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?
STEVE ROGERS: We're working on that right now.
[Cut to the Benatar landing in the yard of the Avenger's Compound. Scott is sitting having a Taco and some Nachos at a bench, and everything falls out of the taco as the Benatar lands. Nebula and Rocket walk out of the ship, and past Scott.]
ROCKET: Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?
SCOTT LANG: Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That's awesome.
NEBULA: [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone.
[She walks away. Moments later, just as Scott is getting back to his senses, Rhodey lands right in front of him without warning. This time Scott is so surprised, he drops the whole taco.]
SCOTT LANG: Oh, God!
RHODEY: What's up, regular sized man?
[As Rhodey walks away, Bruce walks out of the Compound. Seeing that Scott dropped his lunch, he hands two tacos from his own lunch to Scott. Scott takes it while giving Bruce a puzzling look at this act of kindness.]
[Song ""My Supersonic Ship"" plays in the background. Cut to Bruce sitting at the back of a Utility car as they traverse the green countryside of Norway. They pass a sign labelled ""WELCOME TO NEW ASGARD, PLEASE DRIVE SLOWLY."". They stop at a small town on a port. Bruce and Rocket get out of the car, and look around at the remaining Asgardians, living like normal humans at a port.]
ROCKET: Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.
BRUCE BANNER: Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]
VALKYRIE: You shouldn't have come!
BRUCE BANNER: Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl.
VALKYRIE: [Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.
BRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.
ROCKET: How you doin'?
VALKYRIE: [Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.
BRUCE BANNER: That bad, huh?
VALKYRIE: We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies.
BRUCE BANNER: It's that bad.
VALKYRIE: Yeah.
[Cut to Rocket opening a door, and him and Bruce walking through it.]
ROCKET: [Grimacing at the smell] What the...  Woo! Something died in here.
BRUCE BANNER: Hello? Thor?
THOR: [From another room.] Are you here about the cable?
[He walks into view, and the audience's jaw drops. Thor, who is shirtless, has definitely put on more than a couple of pounds since we saw him last.]
THOR: The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He grabs a beer]
BRUCE BANNER: Thor?
[He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there. He cracks into joy.] BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you! [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal! [growling]
ROCKET: No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary.
THOR: Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?
[We see Miek and Korg sitting on a couch, PlayStation controller in hand, playing Fortnite and eating chips.]
KORG: Hey boys!
BRUCE BANNER: Hey guys, long time no see.
KORG: Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game.] Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.
THOR: NoobMaster.
KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.
[Thor walks over to Korg, takes his headphones, and speaks into the mic.]
THOR: Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT!!! Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to your father, you little weasel!
KORG: [Thor brings his headphones back] Thank you, Thor.
THOR: Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?
KORG: Thank you very much. I will.
THOR: So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.
[Thor uses Stormbreaker to open a bottle of beer and starts drinking. Bruce walks to him and places a hand on his shoulder]
BRUCE BANNER: Buddy, you all right?
THOR: ​​​​​​Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?
ROCKET: [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream.
THOR: [Laughs] So, what's up?
BRUCE BANNER: We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.
THOR: What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.
BRUCE BANNER: Like Thanos.
[Thor's smile slowly disappears. He puts a shaky hand on Bruce's shoulder and points at him.]
THOR: Don't say that name.
[Korg stands up and takes off his headphones]
KORG: Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here.
BRUCE BANNER: [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you.
THOR: Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off.
[Thor walks off screen]
KORG: Umm... Stormbreaker?
THOR: Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?
BRUCE BANNER: I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?
THOR: I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
BRUCE BANNER: It was you. You helped me.
THOR: [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway.
BRUCE BANNER: I think we can bring them back.
THOR: Stop. stop, okay? [opens a packet on M&Ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?
[The camera cuts to Korg and Miek eating pizza and playing once more]
KORG: Nah, all good here, mate.
[Cuts back to Thor]
THOR: So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye.
BRUCE BANNER: [from offscreen] We need you, pal.
[Thor shakes his head and ignores Bruce.]
ROCKET: [Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.
THOR: [pauses, but doesn't look up then puts the bottle down] What kind?
[SCREEN TITLE: TOKYO]
[After seeing a Quinjet flown to the capital, the scene cuts to a nightclub in the city of Tokyo, as the entertainment still intact, loads of dead bodies of yakuza members are seen as a hooded figure throws a shuriken at another yakuza member firing at him. They are shouting something in Japanese, as two more men come out of nowhere and draw out their UZIs.]
THUG #1: あいつだ! アキヒコさんを！(Romanized: Aitsu da! Akihiko-san wo!) (Translated: It's him! He's after Akihiko!)
[Both thugs fire their SMGs as both got slain by a shuriken. A yakuza member wielding a katana charges at him in the stairs, but is immediately overthrown and slain by the Ronin. Ronin then fights another sword-wielding thug, which is thrown outside the glass, killing him. The camera passes through two more buildings as the fighting ensues with different screams, shouts, more havoc inside, and gunfire. A man in a dark raincoat jumps through the glass window, with the Ronin doing the same, as both of them lands in a dark alleyway. The man in the raincoat turns to the Ronin, who just landed after him. It was Akihiko, the leader of a yakuza gang, whose head being hunted by the Ronin himself.]
AKIHIKO: てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！(Romanized: Temē naze konna koto wo suru? Oretachi temē ni nani mo shitenē daro!) (English: Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!)
RONIN: [As he draws out his katana and reversibly wields it.]地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの…(Romanized: Chikyū no hanbun sanosu ni yarareta... Omae wa naze buji nano...) (English: You survived... Half of the planet didn't. They got Thanos... you get me.)
[Both sides engaged in combat as Ronin pierces his stomach, but doing only minor damage to him.]
RONIN: [Also in Japanese] お前はもう十分殺しただろ(Romanized:Omae mo jūbun korshita daro) You're done hurting people.
AKIHIKO: [Japanese]俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか! (Orera ga dato? Ki demo kurutta ka!) [he gestures to all the scattered bodies of his henchmen and chuckles] (English: WE hurt people? You're crazy!)
[Akihiko charges, which Ronin immediately blocks. Both clang swords for two seconds, seeming that the yakuza leader has the upper hand, but Ronin punches him in the face, and sword-points him to his throat, in which Akihiko is temporarily petrified.]
[He lowers down his sword as if he is about to surrender, but charges again at Ronin. Both swords clashed as Ronin slices his stomach, losing stamina, but gaining more strength from his rage.]
AKIHIKO: [in a Gatotsu-like sword stance] 死ね! (Romanized: Shine!) (English: DIE!)
[They both draw their katanas and the sword-fight continues. Ronin is clearly a better fighter, but Akihiko is also quite experienced. They clang swords, and for a second, it looks like Akihiko has the upper hand swinging at Ronin's neck. Ronin, however, ducks and slides under the katana, and slices Akihiko in the stomach as he slides past. Akihiko, now fatally injured, drops his katana.]
AKIHIKO: 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい? (Romanized: Mate! Tasukete kure! Omae ni nan demo yaru! Nani ga hosī? (English: Wait! Help me! I'll give you anything! What do you want?)
RONIN: [Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me.
[He thrusts the blade downwards into Akihiko's stomach. The body of the Japanese falls to the ground. Ronin grabs the sword, and wipes it on his gauntlet, ridding it of the blood of Akihiko. He notices someone behind him, and grabs his mask, and slides it off his head, revealing himself as Clint Barton, who has gone on a rampage since the decimation. He turns around and looks at Nat, who is standing behind him, holding an umbrella, and in casual clothes.]
CLINT BARTON: You shouldn't be here.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Neither should you.
CLINT BARTON: I've got a job to do.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.
[Clint starts to look emotional, on the verge of crying.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: We found something. A chance, maybe...
CLINT BARTON: [Now openly crying] Don't...
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Don't what?
CLINT BARTON: ...don't give me hope.
NATASHA: I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.
[We cut to the Avenger's Compound, where we see Thor in a hoodie, drinking a beer and walking through the compound's Testing Chamber. Tony is also there, walking in from behind Thor.]
TONY STARK: [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] Ratchet, How's it going?
ROCKET: It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.
[Cut to a side room, where we see Scott, Bruce, Steve and Rhodey talking. Scott is in a white and red suit, similar to the Ant-Man suit.]
RHODEY: Time travel suit? Not bad.
SCOTT LANG: [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!
BRUCE BANNER: I'm being very careful.
SCOTT LANG: No, you're being very Hulky.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm being careful.
SCOTT LANG: [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.
RHODEY: Scott, calm down.
SCOTT LANG: Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run.
[Cut to the testing chamber, where we see Steve, Nat, Tony, Scott, Bruce, Rhodey and Nebula standing at a control panel, presumably controlling the glass platform.]
SCOTT LANG: All right. I'm not ready for this.
CLINT BARTON: I'm game. I'll do it.
[Clint walks in wearing the suit Scott was moments before, the Quantum Suit.]
BRUCE BANNER: Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it.
[Clint taking position on the platform] 
RHODEY: Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope.]
BRUCE BANNER: [Disgusted] First of all, that's horrible...
RHODEY: [In a tone that says it's what we're all thinking.] It's Thanos.
BRUCE BANNER: ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.
SCOTT LANG: Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.
CLINT BARTON: Bingo.
NEBULA: That's not how it works.
CLINT BARTON: Well, that's what I heard.
BRUCE BANNER: What? By who? Who told you that?
RHODEY: [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -
SCOTT LANG: Quantum Leap -
RHODEY: A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -
SCOTT LANG: Hot Tub Time Machine -
RHODEY: Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.
SCOTT LANG: Die Hard? No, it's not one...
RHODEY: This is known.
BRUCE BANNER: I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...
NEBULA: Exactly.
SCOTT LANG: So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?
BRUCE BANNER: [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!
[A helmet similar to Ant-Man's but white and more visible face pops on Clint's head, and he goes quantum. Clint flies through the quantum realm and into an opening. He grows back to normal size, but he's at a different place, and seemingly, time.]
[Clint look around his family home, which unlike at the start of the movie, looks a lot more alive. The helmet pops off of Clint's head, and he looks around bewildered. He sees a baseball glove on the ground, presumably belonging to one of his sons, and picks it up. We hear a noise from inside the house, someone who Clint hasn't seen for five years.]
LILA BARTON: [offscreen] Cooper? Where are my headphones?
CLINT BARTON: [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]
[We hear footsteps coming towards where Clint has just disappeared, and we see Lila coming down the stairs in Avril Lavigne-like clothing, looking around, puzzled]
LILA BARTON: Yeah, Dad? [She looks around] Dad?
[Lila goes back upstairs, deciding that it was just nothing]
[Cut to the Avengers Compound, we see Clint rematerialise on the glass platform, breathing heavily and sitting on the platform.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?
CLINT BARTON: [Holding up the baseball glove and throw it to Stark] Yeah, it worked. It worked.
[Scene cuts to the Avengers in a room with some hologram displays, showcasing each of the six Infinity Stones, sitting around a table. Tony, Steve and Bruce are pacing at the front, clearly leading the planning of the mission.]
STEVE ROGERS: Okay, so the ""how"" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.
TONY STARK: Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
SCOTT LANG: I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about
BRUCE BANNER: Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.
TONY STARK: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.
CLINT BARTON: Which means we have to pick our targets.
TONY STARK: Correct.
STEVE ROGERS: Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?
[We see Thor sitting on a chair with his sunglasses on. It is impossible to tell whether he is awake or asleep.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is he asleep?
RHODEY: No, I'm pretty sure he's dead.
[Thor wakes up]
THOR: Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.
TONY STARK: Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
THOR: I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you.
[Cut to the Avengers sitting around a table, eating a meal, and Rocket is pacing on the table in front of everyone.]
ROCKET: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
SCOTT LANG: Is that a person?
ROCKET: Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.
SCOTT LANG: A planet? Like in outer space?
ROCKET: Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space.
[Cut to everyone facing Nebula in the planning room, and Nat writing notes for their plan.]
NEBULA: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir?
NEBULA: A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister.
[Nat looks up, and an awkward silence falls upon the room. She writes what Nebula has just said, and Scott makes to break the awkward moment.]
SCOTT LANG: Not it.
[We see Tony and Nat lying on a table surrounded by papers, and Bruce lying down on the floor. The Time Stone pops up on the display.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: That Time Stone guy...
BRUCE BANNER: Doctor Strange.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?
TONY STARK: Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
BRUCE BANNER: Nice place in the village, though.
TONY STARK: Yeah. Sullivan Street.
BRUCE BANNER: Hmm... Bleecker.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Wait, he lived in New York?
TONY STARK: No. He lived in Toronto.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.
BRUCE BANNER: [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door.
[Shot cuts to the holograms displaying the different location, the Soul and Power Stones in space in 2014. the Reality Stone in Asgard, 2013; and the Space, Mind, and Time Stones in New York City, 2012]
STEVE ROGERS: All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.
[He and the other Avengers walk up and look at the screens determinedly.]
[The shot cuts to the Avengers walking in a file to the Quantum Time machine, wearing the Quantum Suits, albeit with some minor differences for different people. Rhodey has a bulkier repaint of the War machine armour. ]
STEVE ROGERS: Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck.
ROCKET:[Refers to Steve's speaking] He's pretty good at that.
SCOTT LANG: Right? [Looks very excited]
TONY STARK: All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.
BRUCE BANNER: Tractors engaged.
ROCKET: [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint's hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?
CLINT BARTON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best.
ROCKET: As promises go, that was pretty lame.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute.
[They all shrink and enter the Quantum Realm, and they all split at different intervals, going to a different place at a different time in history.]
[The First Group which has Tony, Steve, Bruce, & Scott; travels to New York in 2012. A previous stock shot of the Chitauri snarling and the iconic circle take around our six Original Avengers assembling before panning over to a side street where Scott, Steve, Banner and Tony materialise.]
STEVE ROGERS: All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.
[2012 Hulk passes by them, smashing everything in his way. Bruce puts his hand on his face, embarrassed.]
STEVE ROGERS: Feel free to smash a few things along the way.
BRUCE BANNER: I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.
[Present Bruce pretends to smash things in a sarcastic way. He tears his shirt off, and walks over to a car. He lightly punches the car, making a small dent, all the while making growling noises. He picks up a motorbike and throws it at a wall, wincing as it hits the wall.]
[Shot cuts to the Roof of the Sanctum Sanctorum where 2012 The Ancient One protects it. Bruce tries to enter through the roof before noticing her.]
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.
BRUCE BANNER: Ma'am, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?
BRUCE BANNER: That, actually.
[He points towards the Eye of Agamotto where the Time Stone is kept. The Ancient One (2012) looks at it]
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Ah! I'm afraid not.
BRUCE BANNER: Sorry, but I wasn't asking.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You don't wanna do this.
BRUCE BANNER: Ah, you're right, I don't. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-
[The Ancient One (2012) pushes Bruce' astral form out of his body. Bruce who's is now in astral form looks at The Ancient One horrified.]
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Let's start over, shall we?
[Cut to an aerial shot of Asgard in 2013.Then to the prison in Asgard, where we see the Loki from The Dark World, sitting in his cell. Without him noticing, Rocket and Thor creep by, past the cell. They stop at a pillar a few metres away room of where Jane Foster is]
THOR: That's Jane.
ROCKET: All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split.
THOR: I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to fish huge barrel of ale. I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
ROCKET: Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?
[A door opens, Thor and Rocket both try to hide. We then see ladies along with Frigga (2013) walking. Thor sees his mother.]
ROCKET: Who's the fancy broad?
THOR: It's my Mother. She dies today.
ROCKET: Oh. That's today?
THOR: I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.
ROCKET: Come here. [Standing in front of him]
THOR: No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-
ROCKET: Come here. Right here.
[Rocket slaps Thor in the face.]
ROCKET: You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?
THOR: Okay.
ROCKET: Are you crying?
THOR: No...Yes!
ROCKET: Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?
THOR: Yes, I can.
ROCKET: Good.
THOR: I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this.
[Thor runs away.]
ROCKET: Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!
[Cut to Morag in 2014, where we see Rhodey getting off the Benatar as it lands.]
RHODEY: Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.
CLINT BARTON: Hey, can we hurry it up?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock.
[Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination.
RHODEY: All that, is really helpful. [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah.
RHODEY: Take that stone and come back. No messing around.
CLINT BARTON: [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this.
RHODEY: Let's get it done. Yes, sir.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back.
RHODEY: You guys watch each other's six.
[Clint and Nat look back and just smile.]
CLINT BARTON: Yeah.
[They walk back into the ship, and the hatch closes. The ship takes off and speeds out of the atmosphere of Morag.]
NEBULA: The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
[In the Benatar, Clint and Nat are sitting at the front of the ship. The ship takes a jump through space and speeds up tremendously. Nat and Clint look at each other.]
CLINT BARTON: It's a long way from Budapest.
[Natasha just laughs.]
[Back to Morag, where Rhodey and Nebula are standing where we left them.]
RHODEY: Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?
NEBULA: [Looking around] Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
RHODEY: Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?
NEBULA: My father, my sister... and me.
RHODEY: And you? Where are you right now?
[Cuts to a scene of Gamora (2014) and Nebula (2014) fighting some Korbinite soldiers.]
GAMORA (2014): [Helping Nebula up] You're welcome.
NEBULA (2014): I didn't ask for your help.
GAMORA (2014): And yet, you always need it. [Nebula (2014) laughs and Gamora's hand.] Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.
NEBULA (2014): Why?
GAMORA (2014): He's found an Infinity Stone.
NEBULA (2014): Where?
GAMORA (2014): On a planet called Morag.
NEBULA (2014): Father's plan is finally in motion.
GAMORA (2014): One stone isn't six, Nebula.
NEBULA (2014): It’s a start.
GAMORA (2014): If he gets all of them...
[Thanos (2014) arrives, honking badass double-bladed sword in tow and healthy coating blood of his armour.]
THANOS (2014): Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.
GAMORA (2014): He won't like that.
THANOS (2014): His alternative is death, then. [Thanos wipes his double-bladed sword] Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement.
NEBULA (2014): We will not fail you, Father.
[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]
THANOS (2014): No, you won't.
NEBULA (2014): I swear...I will make you proud.
[Nebula (2014) is suddenly in pain and opens up future Nebula's memories.]
RHODEY (Memory): We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?
NEBULA (Memory): Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
[Nebula (2014) shuts off the memory]
GAMORA (2014): Who was that?
NEBULA (2014): I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know...
GAMORA (2014): Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.
[Thanos walks towards Nebula and brings his blade to her throat.]
THANOS (2014): Shhh... (pointing to Nebula) Bring her to my ship.
[Cut to present Tony Stark flying around Stark Tower in the Mark 85. He scans the interior of the tower, and sees the original Avengers apprehending Loki, the backside of the iconic shot of Hawkeye pointing the bow at Loki's face while the Avengers surround him.]
TONY STARK: Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.
[Cut to Steve in Stark Tower, walking towards the elevator.]
STEVE ROGERS: Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.
LOKI (2012): If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.
TONY STARK (2012): All right, get him on his feet. We can all stand around posing up a storm later. By the way, feel free to clean up.
TONY STARK: Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass.
STEVE ROGERS: No one asked you to look, Tony.
TONY STARK: [whispers] It's ridiculous
SCOTT LANG: I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. [Does a patriotic salute.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): Uhh, magic wand?
TONY STARK (2012): STRIKE team's coming to secure it.
[A Hydra team including Rumlow and Sitwell enter, known at this time as a part of SHIELD.]
SITWELL (2012): We can take that [Taking Loki's Scepter from 2012 Natasha] off your hands.
NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): By all means. Careful with that thing.
CLINT BARTON (2012): Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.
SITWELL (2012): We promise to be careful.
SCOTT LANG: Who are these guys?
TONY STARK: They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.
SCOTT LANG: Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys.
TONY STARK: You're small, but you're talking loud.
STEVE ROGERS (2012): On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.
LOKI (2012): [Transforming into Steve for a second in imitation] On my way down to coordinate search and rescue! [Transforming back] I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be...
THOR (2012): [Slapping on a device on Loki's mouth to make him quiet] Shut up.
TONY STARK: All right, you're up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There's our stone.
SCOTT LANG: [Lying down on Tony's shoulder] Alright. Flick me.
[Tony flicks Scott onto his 2012 self, right into his beard. 2012 Tony then scratches his beard, dropping present Scott onto 2012 Tony's reactor.] 
[All of the 2012 Avengers get in an elevator. Hulk makes to follow, but finds the elevator full.]
HULK (2012): Move.
THOR (2012): Whoa!
TONY STARK (2012): Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.
THOR (2012): Take the stairs.
TONY STARK (2012): Yeah. [Hulk draws his fist back right as the elevator door closes] Stop. Stop!
[He follows through with the punch, making a dent in the wall right where the door was.]
HULK (2012): [Pissed] Take the stairs! Hate the stairs!
TONY STARK: All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.
STEVE ROGERS: On it. Head to the lobby.
TONY STARK: Alright. I'll see you there.
[scene cuts to HYDRA agents in the elevator]
SITWELL (2012): Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.
[Elevator opens and HYDRA agents sees Steve. Steve walks in and hits the button to continue down.]
SITWELL (2012): Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?
STEVE ROGERS: Change of plans.
RUMLOW (2012): Hey, Cap.
STEVE ROGERS: Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.
SITWELL (2012): Sir? I don't understand.
STEVE ROGERS: We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.
RUMLOW (2012): Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter.
SITWELL (2012): I'm gonna have to call the Director.
STEVE ROGERS: That's okay. Trust me. [Steve leans over to Sitwell's ear.] Hail Hydra.
[Everyone is surprised, Steve walks out of the elevator with the scepter and a smile.]
[Cut to the building's stairwell. The Hulk looks down at the many stairs below him.]
HULK (2012): [Angrily] So many stairs!
[Cut to the lobby. The 2012 Avengers start to make their way out of the building. Tony and Scott eye them undercover.]
TONY STARK: Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time.
SCOTT LANG: Bombs away. [Sliding down to Tony's Arc Reactor] Is... is that Axe body spray?
TONY STARK: Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?
SCOTT LANG: I'm going inside you. Now.
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): May I ask you where you're going?
THOR (2012): To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are?
TONY STARK (2012): Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.
THOR (2012): Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIELD property for over 70 years.
HYDRA AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark.
TONY STARK: [To present Scott through radio as he inhales sharply] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.
TONY STARK(2012): I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right?
SCOTT LANG: You promise me you won't die?
TONY STARK: You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
SCOTT LANG: That doesn't sound mild.
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): I need the case.
TONY STARK (2012): I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying...
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Okay. Then give me the case.
TONY STARK: Do it, Lang!
TONY STARK (2012): Get your hands off!
TONY STARK: Window's closing. Pull my pin!
SCOTT LANG: Here goes!
[Ant-Man pulls off Stark 2012's reactor, and Tony (2012) drops the case]
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark?
THOR (2012): Stark!
[Stark 2012 falls down to the ground]
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic!
TONY STARK: MEDIC! You guys, some help!
ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark, you--- your chest machine?
[Ant-Man pushes the case, Loki looks at case, Tony Stark grabs the case.]
TONY STARK: Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
[Suddenly, Hulk 2012 pushes Tony to the ground and the Tesseract slides to Loki]
HULK (2012): NO STAIRS!!!!
[Everyone runs from Hulk's rampage, Loki 2012 grabs the Tesseract and teleports it away.]
THOR (2012): You'll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work.
[Thor 2012 uses the Mjolnir as the defibrillator on Tony Stark 2012]
THOR (2012): YES!
TONY STARK (2012): That worked a treat. That was so crazy!
THOR (2012): I had no idea if that was gonna work.
TONY STARK (2012): The case?
THOR (2012): The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki!
SCOTT LANG: That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
TONY STARK: Oh, we blew it.
THOR (2012): Loki!?
[Cut to a walkway several floors up. Steve is having trouble on his communicator.]
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube. [He looks up and groans.] Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[In front of him, Steve sees his 2012 self looking back]
STEVE ROGERS (2012): I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.
STEVE ROGERS: [Puts the case down] I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.
[2012 Steve engages and the two Captain Americas begin to duel.]
STEVE ROGERS (2012): I can do this all day.
STEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Yeah, I know. I know.
[Both Rogers' frisbee their shield's at one another which clang away as they brawl, inadvertently kicking away the case containing the scepter which falls down a few levels. 2012 Steve gets the upper hand on Future Steve's as they both fall down to the same level as the scepter. Future Steve's locket of Peggy falls out, Steve (2012) notices it.]
STEVE ROGERS (2012): Where did you get this?
[Steve (2012) has future Steve in a chokehold]
STEVE ROGERS: Bucky... is... alive!
STEVE ROGERS (2012): What?
[Future Steve takes the chance to sucker punch his counterpart, grab the scepter and knock Steve (2012) out, gets up and stares at him]
STEVE ROGERS: That is America's ass.
[Scene cuts back to Bruce and The Ancient One (2012). As Hulk is lying down on a beach chair who looks like he's sleeping with a hat on, Bruce Banner tries reasoning with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone.]
BRUCE BANNER: Please, please!
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own.
BRUCE BANNER: With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that.
[The Ancient One creates a projection with a long ray that simulates the flow of time.]
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits. [She flicks the Time Stone projection away and Shows black stream indicating a point of divergence] Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?
BRUCE BANNER: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, [Holds the Time Stone projection] in that reality, [puts it back to its spot] it never left.
[Bruce's astral form takes the projection of the removed Time Stone, replaces it back amongst the other five, and the doomed alternate dimension fades away, illustrating his point.]
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [still not convinced.] But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.
BRUCE BANNER: We will. I will. I promise.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.
BRUCE BANNER: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [Surprised] What did you say?
BRUCE BANNER: Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Willingly?
BRUCE BANNER: Yes!
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): ...Why?
BRUCE BANNER: I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Or I did. [She returns to Banner control of his Hulk body and opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone] Strange is meant to be the best of us.
BRUCE BANNER: So he must have done it for a reason.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I fear you might be right. [gives him the Time Stone]
BRUCE BANNER: Thank you.
THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are.
[Cut to Thanos (2014), Nebula (2014), Gamora (2014) and Ebony Maw (2014) on the Sanctuary II.]
THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.
EBONY MAW (2014): Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.
THANOS (2014): Impossible.
EBONY MAW (2014): This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.
THANOS (2014): Where is this other Nebula?
EBONY MAW (2014): In our solar system. On Morag.
THANOS (2014): Can you access her?
EBONY MAW (2014): Yes. The two are linked.
THANOS (2014): Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.
[Memory of the meeting with all the Avengers starts playing]
BRUCE BANNER (2023): And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.
TONY STARK (2023): Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.
CLINT BARTON (2023): Which means we have to pick our targets.
TONY STARK (2023): Correct.
[End memory.]
THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Freeze image.
GAMORA (2014): Terrans.
THANOS (2014): Avengers. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw.
GAMORA (2014): [Looking at a reflection of Nebula (2023)] I don't understand. Two Nebulas.
THANOS (2014): No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.
[Cut back to Thor and Rocket in Asgard, 2013]
FRIGGA (2013): My ladies, I'll see you after. Go on.
[Thor tries not to get caught behind a large post, but gets shocked when he sees his mother behind him] 
FRIGGA (2013): [To Thor] What are you doing?
THOR: Aah!!!
FRIGGA (2013): Aah!!!
THOR: OH, God!
FRIGGA (2013): You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.
THOR: Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh... [Trying to hide his belly]
FRIGGA (2013): What are you wearing?
THOR: I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.
[Frigga puts her hand on Thor's face and takes a good look at him}
FRIGGA (2013): What's wrong with your eye?
THOR: Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?
FRIGGA (2013): You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?
THOR: [Pretending] Yes, I am.
FRIGGA (2013): The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?
THOR: I didn't say I'm from the future.
FRIGGA (2013): I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that.
[Thor attempts to hold back his tears and fails miserably.]
THOR: [voice breaking up] I am totally, totally from the future.
FRIGGA (2013): Yes, you are.
THOR: I really need to talk to you.
FRIGGA (2013): We can talk.
[They both hug each other.]
[Scene cuts to Jane Foster waking up while Rocket sneaks behind her to extract the Aether] 
[Scene cuts back to Thor and Frigga's conversation.]
THOR: His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.
FRIGGA (2013): You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.
THOR: I guess, yeah.
FRIGGA (2013): Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.
THOR: That's a little bit harsh.
FRIGGA (2013): You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.
THOR: I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?
FRIGGA (2013): Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.
THOR: I really missed you, Mum.
[scene cuts to Rocket running away from the Asgardian soldiers]
ROCKET: Thor! I got it!
ASGARDIAN SOLDIER (2013): Get that rabbit!
THOR: Ma, I have to tell you something.
FRIGGA (2013): No, son. You don't. You're here to repair your future, not mine.
THOR: But this is about your future.
FRIGGA (2013): It's none of my business. [does she know?]
ROCKET: Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move.
THOR: I wish we had more time.
FRIGGA (2013): No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.
THOR: I love you, Mom.
FRIGGA (2013): I love you. And eat a salad.
ROCKET: Come on. We gotta go.
FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye.
ROCKET: Three... two...
THOR: No, wait!
[Thor holds out his hand]
ROCKET: [To Frigga] Wh- what am I looking at?
FRIGGA (2013): Oh, sometimes it takes a second.
[Thor summons Mjolnir.]
THOR: [Happy and a little bit surprised] I'm still worthy.
[""Come And Get Your Love"" starts playing in the background.]
ROCKET: Oh, boy.
THOR: Goodbye, Mom.
FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye.
[Scene cuts to Quill on Morag dancing to ""Come And Get Your Love"", we then pan over to Rhodey and Nebula hiding in the background watching Quill dance and sing to their perspective without music.]
RHODEY: So he's an idiot?
NEBULA: Yeah.
[Rhodey knocks out Quill and Nebula rummages around to take Quill's tool.]
RHODEY: What's that?
NEBULA: The tool of a thief.
[Nebula uses the tool to open the door that leads to The Orb A.K.A The Power Stone. Nebula tries to walk in but is stopped by Rhodey.]
RHODEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything...
NEBULA: What are you talking about?
RHODEY: When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–
[Nebula just shakes her head and walks in.]
RHODEY: Okay. All right. Go ahead.
[Nebula forces her hand inside the force field protecting The Orb while it melts away the exterior plating on her arm. She successfully retrieves The Orb and hands it to Rhodey all the while Rhodey watched the whole thing happened.]
NEBULA: I wasn't always like this.
RHODEY: Me either. But we work with what we got, right?
[They just both look at each other solemnly.]
RHODEY: Sync up. [They both suit up.] Three.. two.. one...
[Rhodey is the only one who disappears while Nebula is left behind unable to move, then she riddled with pain on her head. She falls to the ground.]
[Sanctuary II. 2014 Nebula is being scanned in synch with her future self. A memory is played, coming from future Nebulas head.]
BRUCE (Memory): You murdered trillions!
THANOS (Memory): You should be grateful.
NATASHA (Memory): Where are the stones?
THANOS (Memory): Gone. Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE (Memory): You used them two days ago.
THANOS (Memory): I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable.
[Memory pauses.]
GAMORA (2014): What did you do to them?
THANOS (2014): Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.
GAMORA (2014): The stones...
THANOS (2014): I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.
[Thanos (2014) caress Gamora (2014) and she kneels down]
EBONY MAW (2014): This is your future.
THANOS (2014): It's my destiny.
[Maw resumes playing the memory]
NEBULA (Memory): My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
THANOS (Memory): Ah...Thank you, Daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly...
[Thanos gets beheaded in the memory, Gamora (2014) is shocked and stands up]
THANOS (2014): And that, is destiny fulfilled.
EBONY MAW (2014): [Dangerous voice.] Sire, your Daughter...
[Maw (2014) telekinetically wraps a chain around Nebula (2014).]
NEBULA (2014): No!
EBONY MAW (2014): ...is a traitor.
NEBULA (2014): That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.
[Thanos (2014) releases the chain around Nebula (2014) neck and holds her head in his palm]
THANOS (2014): I know. And you'll have the chance to prove it.
[Thanos (2014) makes sure Nebula cannot travel back to 2023. Nebula is stuck in 2014.]
NEBULA: No! He knows! [Runs back to the ship and gets on the comms.] Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows.
[Nebula looks up in horror just to be abducted by the Sanctuary II. The scene cuts to Steve, who has just defeated himself, jumping down from a building with the scepter]
TONY STARK: Cap–
[He turns around to see Tony and Scott sitting in a broken car.]
TONY STARK: Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem.
SCOTT LANG: Huh. Yeah, we do.
STEVE ROGERS: Well, what are we gonna do now?
TONY STARK: You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.
SCOTT LANG: You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–
TONY STARK: You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself.
SCOTT LANG: You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.
TONY STARK: Dude, come on.
SCOTT LANG: You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–
TONY STARK: I dropped the ball.
SCOTT LANG: You ruined the time heist.
TONY STARK: Is that what I did?
SCOTT LANG: Yeah!
STEVE ROGERS: Are there any other options with the Tesseract?
SCOTT LANG: No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that– Bye, bye. You're not going home.
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either.
TONY STARK: I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.
STEVE ROGERS: When were they both there?
TONY STARK: They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
STEVE ROGERS: How vague?
SCOTT LANG: What are you talking about? Where are we going?
TONY STARK: I know for a fact they were there–
SCOTT LANG: Who's they? What are we doing?
TONY STARK: And I know how I know.
SCOTT LANG: Guys, what's up? What is it?
TONY STARK: Well, it looks like we're improvising.
SCOTT LANG: Right. What are we improvising?
TONY STARK: Scott, get this back to the compound.
TONY STARK: Suit up.
SCOTT LANG: What's in New Jersey?
TONY STARK: 0-4,
STEVE ROGERS: 0-4–
-
TONY STARK: Uhh, 0-7.
STEVE ROGERS: 0-7.
-
SCOTT LANG: Excuse me...
TONY STARK: 
1-9-7-0.
STEVE ROGERS: Are you sure?
SCOTT LANG: Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this, and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.
TONY STARK: 
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. [To Steve]
Do you trust me?
STEVE ROGERS: 
I do.
TONY STARK: 
Your call.
STEVE ROGERS: 
Here we go.
[Cut to Steve and Tony in New Jersey, 1970]
OUR WATCHER INFORMANT, STAN LEE (1922-2018 R.I.P): [Driving past Steve and Tony] Hey, man! Make love, not war!
TONY STARK: Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?
STEVE ROGERS: The idea of me was.
TONY STARK: Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?
STEVE ROGERS: 
In plain sight.
[Tony and Steve are in an elevator with a lady]
TONY STARK: [Leaving the elevator] Good luck on your
mission, Captain.
STEVE ROGERS: [Waiting for another floor] 
Good luck on your
project, doctor.
ELEVATOR LADY: 
You're new here?
STEVE ROGERS: Not exactly.
[Cut to Tony in what seems to be a lab area and he is looking for the tesseract]
TONY STARK: [Grabbing Tesseract] 
Gotcha. Back in the game.
HOWARD STARK: 
Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal.
TONY STARK: Oh, yeah.
HOWARD STARK: I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?
TONY STARK: 
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul. [awkwardly bumps into a chair] Pardon me.
HOWARD STARK: Do I know you?
TONY STARK: No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT.
HOWARD STARK: Huh. MIT. Got a name?
TONY STARK: Uh– Howard.
HOWARD STARK: Well, that'll be
easy to remember.
TONY STARK: Howard– Potts.
HOWARD STARK:  
Well, I'm Howard Stark. [Holds out hand to shake.]
TONY STARK: Hi. [Holds Howard's finger]
HOWARD STARK: Shake it, don't pull it.
TONY STARK: Yeah–
HOWARD STARK: You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.
TONY STARK: I'm fine. Just, long hours.
HOWARD STARK: Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts.
TONY STARK: Yeah. That would be swell.
HOWARD STARK: That way.
TONY STARK: Okay.
HOWARD STARK: Need your briefcase?
[Tony grabs the case]
HOWARD STARK: You're not one of
those beatniks, are ya, Potts?
[Cut to a younger Hank Pym in his laboratory.]
CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Hello. Dr. Pym?
HANK PYM: That would be the number that you called. Yes.
CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): This is Captain Stevens from shipping. We have a package for you.
HANK PYM: Bring it up.
CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Well, that's the thing, sir. We can't.
HANK PYM: I'm confused. I thought that was your job.
CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Well, it's just– Sir,
the box is glowing and, to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.
HANK PYM: They didn't open it, did they?
CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Yeah, they did. You better get down here.
[We then see Pym running down a hallway]
HANK PYM: Excuse me! Out of the way!
[cut back to Howard and Tony]
TONY STARK: So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?
HOWARD STARK: My wife's expecting. And, uh– Too much
time in the office.
TONY STARK: Congratulations.
HOWARD STARK: Thanks. Hold this, will you?
TONY STARK: Yeah, sure. How far along is she?
HOWARD STARK: I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.
TONY STARK: I have a little girl.
HOWARD STARK: A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.
TONY STARK: What'd be so awful about that?
HOWARD STARK: Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.
[cut to elevator lady talking to security guards about Tony and Captain America looking fishy]
SECURITY OFFICER: And you've never seen these two men before?
ELEVATOR LADY: No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.
SECURITY OFFICER: Can you describe them?
ELEVATOR LADY: Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
SECURITY OFFICER: Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
ELEVATOR LADY: Definitely Mungo Jerry.
SECURITY OFFICER: Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.
[Steve walks into a room. Feeling safe, he suddenly see's a picture of himself. Then he's surprised to see his love Margret Carter.]
[Cut to Tony and Howard still talking to each other]
TONY STARK: So, where are you
at with names?
HOWARD STARK: Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.
TONY STARK: Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time.
HOWARD STARK: Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?
TONY STARK: Wildly. Yeah.
HOWARD STARK: Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?
TONY STARK: I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–
HOWARD STARK: My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. 
TONY STARK: I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl.
HOWARD STARK: Yeah? Like what?
TONY STARK: ""No amount of money ever
bought a second of time.""
HOWARD STARK: Smart guy.
TONY STARK: He did his best.
HOWARD STARK:
Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts.
TONY STARK: Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country.
HOWARD STARK: Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?
EDWIN JARVIS: You meet a lot of people, sir.
HOWARD STARK: Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
[2014 Nebula has captured 2023 Nebula and 2014 Nebula is fighting her future self.]
NEBULA (2014): You're weak.
NEBULA: I'm you.
[Nebula (2014) throws a punch straight at Present Nebula. Gamora (2014) walks into the room.]
NEBULA: You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what
happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know
how he does that? You wanna know what
he does to you?
NEBULA (2014): That's enough. [kicks Present Nebula to the wall and pulls out her Electric Knife.] You disgust me. But that doesn't
mean you're useless.
[Nebula (2014) steals the golden plate on the side of Present Nebula´s face and wears it herself.]
[Then she walks up to Thanos, gives him a Pym Particle and shows him her new look.]
NEBULA (2014): How do I look?
[Scene cuts to Vormir 2014 where Natasha and Clint arrives].
CLINT BARTON: Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.
[Natasha and Clint starts walking towards the mountain and climb it.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: 
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.
CLINT BARTON: 
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: 
Whatever. He eats garbage
RED SKULL (2014): Welcome.
[Natasha and Clint draws their weapons.]
RED SKULL (2014): 
Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Who are you?
RED SKULL (2014): Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh, good. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.
RED SKULL (2014): Ah, liebchen– If only it were that easy.
[Red Skull leads Clint and Natasha to the cliff]
RED SKULL (2014): What you seek lies
in front of you... as does what you fear.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: The stone is down there.
RED SKULL (2014): For one of you. For the other... In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.
[scene cuts to Natasha sitting on a log while Clint watches the Stonekeeper.]
CLINT BARTON: How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: No. I don't think so.
CLINT BARTON: Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.
CLINT BARTON: Yeah.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Whatever it takes.
CLINT BARTON: Whatever it takes.
[Natasha stands up.]
NATASHA ROMANOFF: If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead.
CLINT BARTON: Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: 
I guess we do.
[Clint holds Natasha's hand and she reciprocates and they look at each other]
CLINT BARTON: 
I'm starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.
CLINT BARTON: Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.
CLINT BARTON: 
Yeah, well, I don't want you to, because I– Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.
CLINT BARTON: 
Maybe you should.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: 
You didn't.
CLINT BARTON: 
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?
[Both Clint and Natasha lean their heads against each other]
CLINT BARTON: Okay. You win.
[Clint smiles and knocks Natasha to the ground]
CLINT BARTON: 
Tell my family I love them.
[Natasha returns the favor by tackling Clint to the ground]
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  
You tell them yourself.
[Natasha electrocutes Clint and she runs towards the cliff. Clint gets up and shoots an explosive arrow knocking her down. Clint then runs towards the cliff and jumps. Natasha jumps after him and hooks him up to a grappling hook]
CLINT BARTON: 
Damn you!
NATASHA ROMANOFF: 
Let me go.
CLINT BARTON: 
No. Please, no.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: 
It's okay.
CLINT BARTON: 
Please– [Natasha kicks the wall, falls off the rope, and plummets to the ground.] NO!!!
[The shot shows her body on the ground, dead. A boom in the sky sends Clint in a pool of water with the Soul Stone in his hand. He hits the ground out of sadness. His Quantum Suit activates and he shrinks back to the present day, soon joined by the others returning from their journeys.]
[Cut to the Avengers HQ and the Quantum platform everyone looks around to see all the recovered stones]
BRUCE BANNER: 
Did we get them all?
RHODEY: You telling me this'll
actually work?
[There's a pause as everyone starts to realise someone is missing]
BRUCE BANNER: 
Clint, where's Nat?
[The silence from Clint tells them all they need to know. The mission was completed but at a dire cost. Sadness overtakes everyone. Bruce falls to his knees and pounds the floor in grief.]
[Cut to outside HQ. Lakeside, Tony, Steve, Thor, Clint, and Bruce are mourning their fallen teammate and friend]
TONY STARK: Do we know if she had family?
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah. Us.
THOR: (confused) What?
TONY STARK: I just asked him a question–
THOR: Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? [GROWLING.] So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.
CLINT BARTON: We can't get her back.
THOR: Wha– what?
CLINT BARTON: It can't be undone. It can't.
[Thor dryly laughs.]
THOR: I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And ""can't"" seems very definitive don't you think?
CLINT BARTON: (to Thor) Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?
THOR: No, that's my point–
CLINT BARTON: It can't– be undone. Or that's at least what the red floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!
[Clint's anger is quickly replaced with grief]
CLINT BARTON: It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.
[In a burst of anger, Bruce grabs a bench and hurls it clear across the lake. His anger spent, he turns to the others with a resigned look on his face]
BRUCE BANNER: She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.
STEVE ROGERS: We will.
[Cut to inside the Avenger's Lab. Tony carefully places the stones in the gauntlet he made while Bruce and Rocket watches. With nervous precision, Tony manipulates the machine and carefully places all six stones into the gauntlet]
ROCKET: Boom!
[Tony and Bruce jump a bit, and quickly groan at Rocket's joke. Scene cuts to another room with the new finished gauntlet. Everyone is gathered around it.]
ROCKET: All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?
THOR: I'll do it.
SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?
THOR: It's okay.
EVERYONE: (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey–
STEVE ROGERS: Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.
THOR:
I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?
SCOTT LANG: We should at least discuss it.
THOR: No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.
TONY STARK: It's not about that–
THOR: (hushes everyone up) It's not that– Stop it! Just let me! (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.
TONY STARK : Look– It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition.
THOR: What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
RHODEY: Cheez Whiz?
THOR: Lightning.
TONY STARK: Yeah.
BRUCE: Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me.
[Thor lets go of Tony. Sorry, Thor. Maybe next time.]
BRUCE BANNER: You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.
STEVE ROGERS: How do we know you will?
BRUCE BANNER: We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. [He takes a good look at the gauntlet] It's like...I was made for this.
[Nebula (2014) sneaks off to the Quantum portal and activates it]
TONY STARK: Good to go, yeah?
BRUCE BANNER: Let's do it.
TONY STARK: You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.
BRUCE BANNER: Got it.
[Everyone gets ready and suits up]
TONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yes, boss.
[Avengers facility goes on lockdown]
BRUCE BANNER: Everybody comes home.
[Bruce puts on the gauntlet, which nanobotically expands to fit his hand, and the power surge overwhelms him. He grunts in pain.]
THOR: Take it off! Take it off!
STEVE ROGERS: No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?
TONY STARK: Talk to me, Banner.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm okay. I'm okay.
[Thor gives a double thumbs up, scene cuts to Nebula (2014) opening the Quantum Tunnel and brings the Sanctuary II to the present.]
[Bruce screams, fighting through the intense pain coursing through his body courtesy of the gauntlet, and manages to snap his fingers. He faints and the gauntlet slides off his arm, Clint kicks it away]
STEVE ROGERS: Bruce!
TONY STARK: Don't move him.
BRUCE ROGERS: [Bruce holds onto Steve's arm] Did it work?
THOR: Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.
[Scott walks towards the outside windows and sees plants and birds. Clint hears his phone ringing and sees it's his wife calling]
CLINT BARTON: (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey.
SCOTT LANG: Guys– I think it worked!
[Bruce opens his eyes and sees the Sanctuary II up in the sky and a single missile heading towards the base blowing away Scott away. Then a continuous array of missiles destroys the base completely and everyone sinks below to the underground.]
[The camera pans over to see Bruce holding up tons of debris from collapsing on top of the other Avengers with his one good arm. Some debris is stuck on top of Rocket.]
ROCKET: I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.
RHODEY: Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damaged suit]
BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!
[Rhodey crawls over to help Rocket while taking a rebar as leverage to lift the debris off Rocket]
ROCKET: Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!
[Rhodey gets Rocket out and they both sigh in relief]
BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey!
[A flood engulfs both Rhodey and Rocket]
[Scene cuts to Scott who survives the blast by shrinking.]
RHODEY: Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!
SCOTT LANG: What?
RHODEY: We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!
SCOTT LANG: Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?
[Scene cuts to Clint in the sewer system and trying to get his bearings. He flashes a light upwards to see what happened.]
CLINT BARTON: Cap?
[Clint finds the gauntlet is with him but senses he's not alone down there. He shoots an arrow with light towards the dark tunnel and finds hordes of Outriders.]
CLINT BARTON: [under his breath] Damn.
[Clint takes the gauntlet and runs towards the opposite direction while the Outriders chase after him.]
[Scene cuts to the Sanctuary II and it beams Thanos (2014) fully armoured to the ground. Nebula walks towards him.]
THANOS (2014): Daughter.
NEBULA (2014): Yes, Father.
THANOS (2014): So, this is the future. Well done.
[Nebula (2014) takes off the orange plate on her head and throws it away]
NEBULA (2014): Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.
[Thanos (2014) plants his double-bladed sword on the ground, takes off his helmet and places on top of the sword's edge.]
THANOS (2014): The arrogant never do.
[Thanos then sits down]
THANOS (2014): Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.
NEBULA (2014): What will you do?
THANOS (2014): Wait.
[Nebula (2014) proceeds to go find the stones and the camera pans over the Sanctuary II and we see Gamora (2014) watching. Gamora (2014) heads over to where Nebula is being held prisoner.]
GAMORA (2014): Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?
NEBULA: I tried to kill you. Several times.
[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]
NEBULA: But eventually,
we become friends. We become sisters.
[Gamora (2014) holds out her hand.]
GAMORA (2014): 
Come on. We can stop him.
[Nebula takes it]
[Scene cuts to Tony walking towards Steve who's unconscious on the ground.]
TONY STARK: Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. [He has Cap's shield.]You lose this again, I'm keeping it.
STEVE ROGERS: What happened?
TONY STARK: You messed with time.
It tends to mess back. You'll see.
[Tony helps Steve on his feet. They walk up to join Thor, who has been observing Thanos (2014) from a distance.] 
TONY STARK: What's he been doing?
THOR: Absolutely nothing.
STEVE ROGERS: Where are the stones?
TONY STARK: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
STEVE ROGERS: So we keep it that way.
THOR: You know it's a trap, right?
TONY STARK: Yeah. And I don't much care.
THOR: Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [Thunder cracks as Thor stretches out both hands to summon both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir (2013). His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let's kill him properly this time.
[The Big Three walk over to confront Thanos face to face]
THANOS (2014): You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
TONY STARK: Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
THANOS (2014): I'm thankful. Because now, I know
what I must do. [stands up] I will shred this universe
down to its last atom. [Thanos (2014) puts on his helmet] And then– With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given. [Thor lights himself up.] A grateful universe.
STEVE ROGERS: Born out of blood.
THANOS (2014): They'll never know it. Because you won't be
alive to tell them.
[The fighting starts, and Thor and Tony go straight at Thanos (2014). Meanwhile, Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are breathing for their lives.]
RHODEY: See you on the other side, man.
SCOTT LANG: Hang on! I'm coming!
[Hawkeye is running with the infinity gauntlet. He blows the place, and escapes before the Outriders overwhelm him. He sees Nebula.]
CLINT BARTON: Oh, hey– I know you.
[Clint gives her the gauntlet. then she puts her hand on her earpiece]
NEBULA: Father.
[Clint gasped and finds out that she's from 2014]
NEBULA (2014): I have the stones.
CLINT BARTON: What?!
[Clint tries to get up but Nebula (2014) steps her foot down on him an points her gun at him]
GAMORA (2014): Stop.
[Gamora (2014) come around the corner]
NEBULA (2014): You're betraying us?
[With her hands up, Nebula joins Gamora (2014). Nebula (2014) points her gun at her future self]
NEBULA: You don't have to do this.
NEBULA (2014): I am this.
GAMORA (2014): No, you're not.
NEBULA: You've seen what we become.
GAMORA (2014): Nebula, listen to her.
NEBULA: You can change.
NEBULA (2014): He won't let me.
[Nebula (2014) points a gun at Gamora (2014)]
GAMORA (2014): NO!
[Present Nebula shoots Nebula (2014) and she dies. Hawkeye picks up the Infinity Gauntlet]
[Cut to the 3 heroes battling Thanos]
TONY STARK: Okay, Thor. Hit me.
[Thor bangs his 2 hammers together combined with his lightning. Tony's suit sucks up the energy and he shoots it out using his hands and his body. Thanos twirls his blade really fast to divert the energy. Thor grabs Stormbreaker and uses it to bat Mjölnir to hit Thanos. Thanos uses Tony as a shield resulting in damage to his system.]
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, wake up!
[Steve tries to attack Thanos but is easily shielded away by the Mad Titan. Thor's attack on Thanos is blocked by his sword. Thor is beaten and choked by Thanos, as he punches him. Mjolnir is flicked away as Thanos relentlessly beats up Thor, throwing him into a tree and socking him before throwing him over rubble and socking him again. Thor tries to grab Stormbreaker but Thanos grabs it and uses it against Thor as he tries to defend himself. Mjölnir (2013) starts to float off the ground while Thanos is digging it into Thor, when suddenly Mjolnir flies into Thanos, zooms past, stops, and flies back, both look on in amazement as Steve picks up the hammer.]
THOR: I knew it!
[Thanos' (2014) kicks Thor to the ground and proceed to battle Steve dual wielding both his shield and Mjolnir (2013)]
[Steve proceeds to charge at Thanos swinging Mjolnir (2013) and hitting Thanos in the face knocking him down. Steve throws his shield and Thanos (2014) deflects, Steve throws Mjolnir (2013) to his shield creating a shockwave and knocking Thanos (2014) off his feet. Steve goes on the offensive on Thanos, throwing his shield first at Thanos and quickly hitting it back at him again with Mjolnir. He lines his arm back up and underarms a channel of lightning on Thanos.]
[Thanos eventually gets the upper hand, he removes his helmet, stabs Steve on the leg and knocks Mjolnir (2013) out of his hand. Thanos proceed to destroy Steve's shield with his double-bladed sword and throws him across the battlefield.]
[Steve staggeredly tries to get up.]
THANOS (2014): In all my years of conquest– violence– slaughter– It was never personal. But I'll tell you now– what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet– I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.
[Thanos' (2014) entire army is summons to the ground which include the Children of Thanos, Chitauri, Sakaarans, Outriders and Chitauri Gorillas. Upon seeing the army descending on Earth, Steve slowly gets back to his feet. With a fierce determination, he tightens his broken shield to his arm and stands against Thanos' giant army alone. Suddenly, a crackling comes in on his communicator.]
SAM WILSON: Hey, Cap, you read me?
[Steve stops and looks around] 
SAM WILSON: Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?
[A yellow portal begins to form behind him.]
SAM WILSON: On your left.
[Steve looks behind to see the portal on his left side. Three figures step through; Okoye, Shuri, and Black Panther, fully restored and ready to fight. Steve and the revived Wakandans share a look when Sam zooms in from above in his Falcon armor. As he does, we see dozens more portals opening up all around the battlefield. Through one of these, we see Doctor Strange descend in. He is joined by Drax, Mantis, Star Lord, and Spider-Man. Everyone watches in confusion and awe as more and more heroes arrive from all corners of the universe, all backed up with forces of their own including Black Panther and his Wakandan army, Valkyrie and the Asgardians, Wong and the Masters of the Mystic Arts and several Ravager ships. Amongst the throngs of heroes we see Bucky, Groot, the Scarlet Witch, the Wasp, and Pepper Potts (clad in her own iron suit) arrive. Nearly every hero has magically been transported to the battlefield to face Thanos' hordes.]
DOCTOR STRANGE: Is that everyone?
WONG: What, you wanted more?
[Giant-Man emerges from the rubble of the Avengers facility with Professor Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket. The Avengers, Guardians, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers take up battle positions. The heroes standing across Thanos' forces.]
STEVE ROGERS: AVENGERS! [he summons Mjolnir] –assemble.
[Thor makes a battle cry, as does Black Panther and the heroes charge, the Avengers theme swelling with their stride. Thanos raises his sword towards them, commanding his army to charge as well. Then both sides collide. The camera switches between the meet-line, Drax and Korg, Pepper and Tony, all which are battling against Thanos' army.]
[Cuts to Steve and Thor fighting. Steve takes Stormbreaker but Thor flies to him and passes Mjolnir]
THOR: No, no, give me that. You have the little one. [best meme ever]
[Later, Tony Stark is seen fighting some of Thanos' army. But Cull Obsidian punches him to the ground, then Giant-Man stomps him flat and Peter Parker runs to Tony.]
PETER PARKER: Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, ""It's been five years. Come on, they need us."" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time–
TONY STARK: He did? Oh, God.
PETER PARKER: What are you doing?
[Tony hugs Peter, making him shocked, but he hugs Tony back.]
PETER PARKER: Oh, this is nice.
[Cut to Star-Lord Fighting a bunch of Sakaarans, killing all of them except one, which makes him fall over, but a off-screen shot kills him and he drops on Peter. Peter gets up and sees Gamora (2014). Thinking its present Gamora, he is shocked.]
PETER QUILL: Gamora? [Peter slowly approaches Gamora (2014)] I thought I lost you.
[Peter touches Gamora's hair, not knowing she isn't present Gamora. In response, Gamora (2014) grabs Peter's hand firmly off her hair.]
PETER QUILL: Ow.
GAMORA (2014): [Kicks Peter in the nuts, slightly hurting Peter] Don't– touch– [Kicks him again, this time harder] me!
[Peter falls from the pain, while Gamora (2014) wipes her face.]
PETER QUILL: You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.
GAMORA (2014): [to Nebula] This is the one? Seriously?
NEBULA: The choices were him, or a tree.
[Peter pointing to Gamora (2014) in confusion, then to Nebula in question, and then back to Gamora (2014).]
[Later, Clint is seen running with the gauntlet]
CLINT BARTON: Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?
STEVE ROGERS: Get those stones as far away as possible!
BRUCE BANNER: No! We need to get them back where they came from.
TONY STARK: No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
SCOTT LANG: Hold on! [Scott shrinks to normal size and pulls out a remote.] That wasn't our only time machine.
[Scott presses the button, which activates Luis's van's Horn with the song La Cucaracha, which is heard from afar. Hearing so, Cap goes to higher ground.]
STEVE ROGERS: Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?
VALKYRIE: Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!
TONY STARK: Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?
SCOTT LANG: Maybe ten minutes.
STEVE ROGERS: Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.
HOPE VAN DYNE: We're on it, Cap.
[Scott and Hope share a look and they shrink. Scott grabs Hope, and they fly to the van. Doctor Strange traps a group of Chitauri in his magic and sends them through portals as Tony joins him.]
TONY STARK: Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.
DOCTOR STRANGE: If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.
TONY STARK: You better be right.
[Cut to Scott and Hope entering a small hole in the van's window, getting to the drive seat, regrowing and trying to activate the Quantum Tunnel.]
THE WASP: It's a mess back here.
SCOTT LANG: It's– it's dead.
THE WASP: What?
SCOTT LANG: It's dead. I have to hotwire it.
THANOS (2014): Where's Nebula?
CORVUS GLAIVE: She's not responding.
EBONY MAW (2014): [pointing.] Sire!
[Thanos sees the gauntlet. Clint rushes through Outriders, before finding himself surrounded. He is saved by Black Panther.] 
T'CHALLA: Clint! Give it to me.
[Clint gives the Gauntlet to T'Challa, and he runs towards the van while fighting Thanos' army. Eventually he is stopped by the double edged sword, boomeranged by Thanos. When it gets back to him, he charges T'Challa, but is stopped by Wanda, who is filled with anger for the loss of Vision.]
WANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me.
THANOS (2014): I don't even know who you are.
WANDA MAXIMOFF: You will.
[With her powers, Wanda picks up some debris on the ground and tries to crush Thanos with it.]
[Ebony May grabs the Gauntlet with his telekinesis of bricks. He does the same for T'Challa, trying to stop him from getting the glove.]
PETER PARKER: I got it!
[Peter grabs the Gauntlet with his webshooters and is surrounded by Chitauri.]
PETER PARKER: Activate Instant Kill!
[The Robotic Spider Legs come out of his back, stabbing the Chitauri.]
[Thanos tries to kill Wanda with his double-bladed sword, but Wanda pushes it away. She then uses her powers to try and crush Thanos.]
THANOS (2014): Rain fire!
CORVUS GLAIVE: But sire, our troops!
THANOS (2014): Just do it!
[The spaceship cannons appear and start to fire at the heroes. It flings Maximoff away. Wong makes a shield and holds it up. The others do the same. Suddenly one of the cannons hit a dam. Water starts to flood into the battlefield. Pepper is the first to notice.]
PEPPER POTTS: Uh, is anyone else seeing this?
[Doctor Strange looks at the broken dam and uses his magic to stop the water from flooding the battlefield. Meanwhile, Peter is still battling the Chitauri.]
PETER PARKER: I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!
STEVE: Hey, Queens, heads up.
[Steve throws Mjolnir, and Peter shoots a web and glides along, then Pepper Potts catches him]
PEPPER POTTS: Hang on. I got you, kid. [She drops him on Valkyrie's Pegasus]
PETER PARKER: Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!
[The cannons knock Peter Parker off the Pegasus, then they turn to face something in the sky as all the cannons start shooting at something.]
SAM: What the hell is this?
TONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Something just entered the upper atmosphere.
[A bright light of thundering energy comes surging down as Carol Danvers flies through the ship, and it results in an explosion and the ship crash-landing in the lake]
ROCKET: Oh, yeah!
STEVE ROGERS: Danvers, we need an assist here.
[Cut to Scott finally activating the Quantum Tunnel. Then cut to Carol Danvers landing near Peter, who is on the ground, weirdly hugging the gauntlet with his body.]
PETER PARKER: Hi. I'm– Peter Parker.
CAROL DANVERS: Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?
PETER PARKER: [Gets up and passes her the gauntlet] I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.
[Wanda arrives, Valkyrie flying on her Pegasus as she arrives.]
WANDA MAXIMOFF: Don't worry.
OKOYE: She's got help.
[Pepper lands next to Okoye, followed by Mantis, Shuri, the Wasp, 2014 Gamora and Nebula. Thanos' army charges while the women help Carol Danvers go through the Outriders, Sakaarans and Chitauri. 2014 Gamora takes out a gorilla, while Okoye takes out Corvus Glaive. Wanda and Valkyrie destroy two leviathans. Carol Danvers then starts flying towards the van with the Gauntlet, flying past enemies and going through enemy blockades that are in her way with ease. Thanos, seeing this, starts running to Carol Danvers, but is stopped by Pepper, Shuri and The Wasp, who blast him backwards. Thanos, after seeing Carol Danvers fly past him, throws his double sword at the van, destroying it and the quantum realm tunnel, throwing Carol Danvers backwards and losing her grip on the Gauntlet, which falls to the ground. Doctor Strange steadies the water after the explosion. In the final brawl for the Stark Gauntlet, Stark moves one of Thanos' enemies aside and sees the Gauntlet. He runs to get it, but sees Thanos, who Stark tackles. Thanos smacks Stark away, knocking him out. Then Thor arrives with Stormbreaker and 2013 Mjolnir in an attempt to pin Thanos' arm down, with assistance from Captain America. However, Thanos overpowers them and knocks them both out. After picking up the Gauntlet, Carol Danvers arrives, punching away at Thanos while he is holding the Gauntlet. She keeps punching him, but Thanos grabs her by the arm and flings her away. Thanos puts on the gauntlet, gamma radiation from the stones eating at him as he tries to snap, but Carol Danvers arises again, and stops his fingers from snapping, opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers: Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]
THANOS (2014): I am– inevitable.
[Thanos snaps his fingers, but nothing happens except a metallic ""clink."" He sees the Infinity Stones are missing. Tony has the stones on his own gauntlet, the gamma radiation coursing through him, to Thanos' shock.]
TONY STARK: And I– am– Iron Man.
[Tony snaps his fingers with a loud ""CLANG"" and a blinding flash of white. Rocket fires at a Leviathan and before it devours him, it crumbles into ash. The Black Order starts crumbling to ash. T'Challa and Quill look around in surprise; Steve looks on in exhaustion, knowing that they have won. Thanos, in horror, looks around and sees his entire army disintegrate. He looks at Steve, who just stares at him. Thanos sits down and mourns before slowly being erased from existence himself.]
[Cut back to Tony. The power of the gauntlet raw energy has left his entire right side fatally injured. He stumbles for a bit before his body collapses besides a pile of debris. Rhodey soon flies in and goes up to Tony to see his long time colleague and friend fading away. He bows his head, knowing the damage was done. Peter Parker soon flies in and sees Tony collapsed on the ground.]
PETER PARKER: Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey– Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark– We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it. [He kneels]
[Tony is unresponsive. Peter breaks down and hugs him.]
PETER PARKER: I'm sorry– Tony–
[Peter is gently led aside to grieve. Pepper Potts sits in front of the fading Iron Man.]
PEPPER POTTS: Hey.
[Tony is barely able to move his head, but manages to look Pepper in the eyes]
TONY STARK: [quietly] Hey, Pep..
[Pepper places her hand on Tony's Arc Reactor and Tony rests his hand on hers. Pepper takes a good look at Tony's fatal injuries.]
[pepper kneels]
PEPPER POTTS: F.R.I.D.A.Y.?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Life functions critical.
[Tony smiles with tears in his eyes.]
PEPPER POTTS: Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.
[With that acknowledgement, Tony's arc reactor flickers off for good. Pepper can no longer contain her grief and starts crying on his shoulder. Tony Stark, Iron Man, Earth's Best Defender, died. All the heroes gather, and kneel in honor of Tony.]
[We cut to a montage showing reunions and celebrations. At Clint Barton's farm, he joyfully reunites with his family. At Peter Parker's school, Peter and Ned meet in the hallways. They share a handshake before giving each other a heartfelt hug. In San Francisco, Scott Lang watches fireworks with Cassie Lang and Hope Van Dyne. In Wakanda, T'Cahlla, Shuri, and Ramonda oversee the celebrations from their balcony. Over all this, we hear Tony's voice narrating.]
TONY STARK (voiceover): Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.
[Cut to the Stark household. Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan, and Rhodey all watch Tony's holographic message being projected from his Iron Man helmet. Tony is sitting down recording the message.]
TONY STARK (hologram): So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's– it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That's the thing. Then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. [Tony suddenly gets up walking towards his camera] What am I even trippin' for? Everything's gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. [He leans down and smiles. He is looking straight at Morgan] I love you 3,000.
[The message ends and the hologram cuts out.]
[Cut to outside the cottage. Pepper carries a wreath out of the house to an audience waiting outside for the intimate funeral. She lays the wreath on the lake. On top of the wreath is Tony's first arc reactor which Pepper had framed with the words ""Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart"" back in 2008. The camera slowly pans to see Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan, & Rhodey, all being joined by Steve Rogers, Peter Parker, May Parker, Thor, Bruce Banner, Doctor Strange, Wong, Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne, Janet Van Dyne, Hank Pym, Peter Quill, Nebula, Rocket, Teenage Groot, Drax, Mantis, T'Challa, Okoye, Shuri, Clint Barton & his family, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, Harley Keener, Secretary Ross, Maria Hill, Carol Danvers, and Nick Fury, silently watching the wreath float away.]
[Cut to Clint and Wanda, standing by the riverside shortly afterwards.]
CLINT: You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won. [Looks over to Wanda.] We did it.
WANDA MAXIMOFF: She knows– They both do.
[Clint gives her a side hug and Wanda reciprocates.]
[scene cuts to Happy and Morgan.]
HAPPY: How you doing, Squirt?
MORGAN STARK: Good.
HAPPY: You good? Okay. You hungry?
MORGAN STARK: Mm. Hm.
HAPPY: What do you want?
MORGAN STARK: Cheeseburgers.
HAPPY: You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.
MORGAN STARK: Okay.
[Following the funeral for Tony, we cut to Thor and Valkyrie in New Asgard.]
VALKYRIE: So, when can we expect you back?
THOR: Um– about that–
VALKYRIE: Thor. Your people need a king.
THOR: No, they already have one.
VALKYRIE: That's funny. You're being serious?
[Thor nods his head]
THOR: It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are.
VALKYRIE: You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.
THOR: I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.
[Thor offers Valkyrie a farewell handshake]
VALKYRIE: What will you do?
THOR: I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though.
[Camera pans to the Benatar parked on the cliff]
ROCKET: Move it or lose it, hairbag.
[scene cuts to Quill searching for Gamora on the screen as Thor walks in he closes it]
THOR: Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well– [Thor removes his shades and taps Quill on the shoulder] The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. Where to first? [Thor touches the screens map to pick their destination]
QUILL: Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge.
THOR: I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course.
QUILL: See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.
THOR: Quail– you– that– that's your own–
QUILL: Quail?
THOR: –insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.
QUILL: It's Quill.
THOR: That's what I said.
DRAX: You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
NEBULA: Sounds fair.
[Quill looks around]
QUILL: It's not necessary.
THOR: It's not.
QUILL: Okay?
ROCKET: I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.
MANTIS: [enthusiastically] Oooh, yes. Please, use knives.
DRAX: Yeah, knives.
GROOT: I am Groot.
[Both Thor and Quill laugh but Quill tries to laugh harder]
QUILL: Not necessary...
THOR: There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.
QUILL: [glances at Thor] Me, right?
THOR: Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course.
[Scene cuts to Bruce, Steve, Sam and Bucky at the funeral]
BRUCE BANNER: Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.
STEVE ROGERS: Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches.
BRUCE BANNER: You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. [Looks at Steve] I miss her, man.
STEVE ROGERS: Me, too.
SAM WILSON: You know, if you want, I can come with you.
STEVE ROGERS: You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though.
[Steve goes over to Bucky]
STEVE ROGERS: Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.
BUCKY BARNES: How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.
[They both hug each other]
BUCKY BARNES: Gonna miss you, Buddy.
STEVE ROGERS: It's gonna be okay, Buck.
[Steve goes over to the Quantum portal and dons the Quantum suit]
SAM WILSON: How long is this gonna take?
BRUCE BANNER: For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.
[Steve picks up Mjolnir (2013)]
BRUCE BANNER: Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?
STEVE ROGERS: You bet.
BRUCE BANNER: Going quantum. Three, two, one–
[Steve disappears into the Quantum portal]
BRUCE BANNER: And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–
[Steve doesn't appear on the pad. Bruce looks around the equipment]
SAM WILSON: Where is he?
BRUCE BANNER: I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.
[Bucky turns around from the pad]
SAM WILSON: Well, get him back.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm trying.
SAM WILSON: Get him the hell back!
BRUCE BANNER: Hey, I said, I'm trying!
BUCKY BARNES: Sam...
[Sam walks toward Bucky. Sam, Bucky, and Bruce see old looking Steve sitting on a log. Sam and Bucky go near him.]
BUCKY BARNES: Go ahead.
[Bucky has a smile forming and looks over to Sam. He walks towards the old man and instantly recognizes the now-elderly Steve Rogers]
SAM WILSON: Cap?
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Hi, Sam.
[Old Steve looks over to Sam]
SAM WILSON: So did something go wrong, or did something go right?
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.
SAM WILSON: How'd that work out for you?
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: It was beautiful.
SAM WILSON: I'm happy for you. Truly.
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Thank you.
SAM WILSON: Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Oh, That reminds me. [brings out his shield.] Try it on.
[Sam look over to Bucky, who nods, and Sam holds Steve's shield.]
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: How does it feel?
SAM WILSON: Like it's someone else's.
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: It isn't.
[Sam tries to hold back tears]
SAM WILSON: Thank you. I'll do my best.
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: That's why it's yours. [shakes Sam's hand]
SAM WILSON: [seeing elderly Steve's wedding ring] You wanna tell me about her?
(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: [smiling] No. No, I don't think I will.
[In the final scenes, Steve has time traveled back to the 1940s to be with Peggy Carter. They are seen dancing to ""It's Been a Long, Long Time"" in their home, and they end with a kiss.] – ""It's Been a Long, Long Time"" performed by Harry James and His Orchestra, sung by Kitty Kallen, written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne
[In the very end of the film, the sound of hammering metal is heard in the background. A dedication to Tony Stark.]

[Marvel Opening Credits]
[Radio transmission sound]
[The Marvel Studios Logo plays as usual but this time, at the end of that logo, the I and O in ""Studios"" become 10 in red. The logo now reads ""Marvel Studios"". Throughout the logo, an Asgardian is reporting a distress signal.]
Asgardian PA: This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard. [The voice becomes more desperate and pleading] Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft! [The ship is being hit by missiles.]
[Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reaches out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacks the strength. Maw steps over them with no mind as he speaks, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.]
Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... [Corvus Glaive stabs one of the lingering Asgardians] for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.
[Loki stands with the Black Order. He watches Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.]
Thanos: [Looking out the large window we saw at the end of Thor: Ragnarok] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [Lifts Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggles feebly.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.
[Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the violet Power Stone.]
Thor: [Now being held by Thanos with one huge hand wrapping around his head; blood drools from his mouth] You talk too much.
Thanos: [To Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.
[The Black Order heft their weapons or smirks, as appropriate.]
Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!
[Thanos' face expresses surprise briefly before presses the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glows brightly. Thor screams hoarsely.]
Loki: [Starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!
Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.
[Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself.]
Thor: You really are the worst brother.
Loki: [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.
Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.
Loki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk.
[Thanos looks to his right just as a green and very angry mass slams into him. Loki dives for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skitters across the floor, and the Hulk charges Thanos. The Hulk pummels Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering.]
Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.
[Thanos pries the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crosses his green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picks up the Hulk and slams him to the deck, defeated. Thor slams a metal bar across Thanos' back to no avail, is kicked across the deck by Thanos and is promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further.]
Heimdall: [Prays] Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.
[Heimdall summons the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he meets Thor's eye.]
Thanos: That was a mistake.
[Thanos borrows Corvus's glaive and stabs Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.]
Thor: NO!!! [After Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!
Ebony Maw: [Shuts Thor's mouth with his telekinesis] Shh.
Ebony Maw: [Kneels before Thanos, offering up the Tesseract] My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.
[Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blows some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and is momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seats in its setting.]
Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.
Proxima Midnight: [Kneeling] Father, we will not fail you.
Loki: [Emerging from behind the Black Order] [cheerfully] If I might interject… if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.
Thanos: [Unimpressed] If you consider failure experience.
Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard... [looks significantly at Thor] Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.
[Thor squints and notices a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braces himself, thrusts upward with lightning speed and attempts to stab Thanos, but is frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home.]
Thanos: ""Undying?"" You should choose your words more carefully.
[Thanos twists the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then takes hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifts him to eye level. Loki struggles, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck.]
Loki: [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You will... never be... a god. [Thanos crushes Loki's neck, killing him.]
Thor: [Muffled] NO!
Thanos: [Walks over and drops Loki's body in front of Thor.] No resurrections this time.
[Thanos raises the gauntlet, sends violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and uses the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order.]
Thor: No… Loki….
[Thor is released from his bonds. He crawls over to Loki's body -- which, unlike in The Dark World, has not returned to its Jotun form -- and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes.]
[The Bifrost continues its journey, bringing the Hulk across space to Earth.]
[Sanctum Sanctorum, New York City]
[Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, proceeds down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong.]
Stephen Strange: [Dressed in casual American clothes.] Seriously? You don't have any money?
Wong: [Dressed as Wong is always dressed.] Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
Stephen Strange: I'll tell the guys at the deli. [Wryly] Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.
Wong: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.
Stephen Strange: Dollars?
Wong: Rupees.
Stephen Strange: Which is?
Wong: Uh, buck and a half.
Stephen Strange: What do you want?
Wong: I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.
[Bruce crash-lands through the Sanctum stairs. The Cloak of Levitation swirls around Strange's shoulders immediately.]
Bruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...
Stephen Strange: [Sharing a look with Wong, and now fully in his mage attire] Who?
[Title Screen: Avengers: Infinity War]
[Public Park, New York City, day. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk on having a conversation.]
Tony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.
Pepper Potts: [Laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally rambling.
Tony Stark: [Also talking over her] No, I'm not.
Pepper Potts: Lost me.
Tony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
Pepper Potts: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'
Pepper Potts: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.
Tony Stark: Yes.
Pepper Potts: Yeah. Everybody has that.
Tony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?
Pepper Potts: [Nodding in understanding] Right.
Tony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.
Pepper Potts: So you woke up, and thought that we were...
Tony Stark: Expecting.
Pepper Potts: Yeah.
Tony Stark: [Becoming excited] Yes?
Pepper Potts: [Shaking her head] No.
Tony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.
Pepper Potts: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.
[Pepper unties his jacket sleeves and taps Tony's chest attachment.]
Tony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.
Pepper Potts: It's not helping your case, OK?
Tony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-
Pepper Potts: [Insistently] You don't need that.
Tony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...
Pepper Potts: Shirts?
Tony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Pepper Potts: You should have shirts in your closet.
Tony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Tony Stark: I will. [Tony kisses Pepper.]
[Doctor Strange comes through a portal.]
Stephen Strange: Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.
[Tony and Pepper are understandably shocked.]
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?
Stephen Strange:We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.
Tony Stark: And who's ""we""?
Bruce Banner: [Emerges from behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony.
Tony Stark: [Looking surprised] Bruce.
Bruce Banner: Pepper.
Pepper Potts: Hi.
Tony Stark: You okay?
[Bruce gives Tony a desperate hug, not answering. After everything he has been through, we understand.]
[Back at the Sanctum Sanctorum.]
Wong: [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.
Stephen Strange: [Each Stone lights up as Dr. Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
[Dr. Strange opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone emitting emerald light.]
Tony Stark: [Very attentive] Tell me his name again.
Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.
Tony Stark: [Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?
Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...
Stephen Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.
Tony Stark: [Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run.] Did you seriously just say ""hitherto undreamt of""?
Stephen Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Tony Stark: Is that what this is.... ?
[The Cloak of Levitation smacks Tony's arm, surprising him.]
Tony Stark: [Looking offended] [Straightening himself] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?
Stephen Strange: No can do.
Wong: We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.
Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so....
Stephen Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Tony Stark: It's not bad.
Stephen Strange: A bit chalky.
Wong: A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.
Bruce Banner: That's a thing?
Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: things change.
Stephen Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.
Stephen Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.
Tony Stark: [Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?
Stephen Strange: [Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag.
[You seriously can't tell who's sarcasm is better.]
Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.
Tony Stark: [Awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing.
Bruce Banner: What do you mean?
Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.
Bruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?
Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
Stephen Strange: Who could find Vision, then?
Tony Stark: [Quietly to himself] Shit. [To the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.
Stephen Strange: [Sighing in exasperation] Oh, great.
Tony Stark: Maybe. But... [Sighs]
Bruce Banner: [Missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.
Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?
Bruce Banner: No.
Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Bruce Banner: [Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Bruce Banner: [Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.
[Tony hesitates, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost friend. Before clicking ""Call"", he pauses, distracted by an unusual rumbling.]
Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?
Stephen Strange: [Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no.
[Tony looks at the Hulk-made opening through the ceiling and sees debris flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum through the front door and scans the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos -- people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman falls nearly at his feet and he helps her up.]
Tony Stark: You okay?
[The woman ignores him and runs away. A car crashes in on a pole behind Tony.]
Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.
Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!
Tony Stark: [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Not sure, I'm working on it.
Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
Stephen Strange: [Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.
[A mechanical hum grows louder as Tony approaches the intersection. As he turns the corner, he sees a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.]
[On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stand up. He looks out the window and sees the ship.]
Peter Parker: [Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.
Ned Leeds: [Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!
[Students scramble to the windows in the back to see the spaceship.]
[Peter quickly slides on one of his Stark-made webshooters, and webs the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus.]
School Bus Driver, Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?
[Peter jumps out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He makes his way hastily towards the ship.]
Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Will do.
[Doctor Strange throws the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winks at Tony. The dust clears. Tony is begrudgingly amused for a split second.]
[Then Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian exit the ship by transmat.]
Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...
Tony Stark: [Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.
Ebony Maw: [Looks at Doctor Strange] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?
Stephen Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]
Tony Stark: It means get lost, Squidward!
Ebony Maw: He exhausts me.
Cull Obsidian: [Two untranslated syllables]
Ebony Maw: Bring me the Stone.
Cull Obsidian: [Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.]
Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?
Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?
Tony Stark: That's right.
[Bruce attempts to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck.]
Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.
Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.
Tony Stark: Where's your guy?
Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.
Bruce Banner: I know.
Tony Stark: [Points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.
[Bruce gives out a loud grunt, but fails to release the Hulk. Doctor Strange stares at Tony and Bruce in disbelief.]
Tony Stark: [Glances at Doctor Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry. [Stammers] Either I can't or he won't--
Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
Wong: I have him.
Bruce Banner: Damn it.
[As Cull Obsidian approaches the team, Tony dons his nanotech Iron Man suit in the space of three steps. He grows a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grows a set of blasters that easily throw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestures and deflects his massive companion into some cars.]
Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?
Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--
[Ebony Maw creates a spike of earth that throws Iron Man far up, and attacks the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summons the Shield of the Seraphim.]
Stephen Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us....
[Doctor Strange teleports Bruce to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Iron Man returns and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cuts it in half and lets the pieces fly past him, untouched.]
Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.
Stephen Strange: It stays with me.
Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.
[Iron Man flies through Ebony Maw's obstacle course but is cut short by Cull Obsidian's hammer, sending him through a building and into the park at high speed, plowing into the ground and fetching up against a tree.]
Bruce Banner: [Rushing over to Iron Man] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?
Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.
[Cull Obsidian arrives at the park and throws his hammer at Bruce and Iron Man.] 
Tony Stark: Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way.]
[Iron Man's energy beam deflects off Cull Obsidian's shield, slicing down trees. Bruce barely evades one.]
Bruce Banner: [Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [Starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!
Hulk: [Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree.]
Bruce Banner: What do you mean, ""no""?!
[Iron Man is knocked down by Obsidian, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man.]
Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?
Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.
[Cull Obsidian grabs Spider-Man and throws him away.]
Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
[Wong and Doctor Strange fight Maw. Maw lifts several bricks from the ground and turns them into sharp points. He sends them towards Wong and Doctor Strange. The two make portals and boomerang them back towards Maw. Maw moves a car to protect himself, but one spike still hits his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw uses a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious.]
[Doctor Strange snaps a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanks, but Maw flies forward with the pull and pins Doctor Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.]
Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
[Maw tries to grab the amulet holding the Time Stone but jerks back when it burns his hand.]
Stephen Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
Ebony Maw: [Vehemently] Then I'll take it off your corpse.
[Maw pulls Doctor Strange away from the building and throws him to the ground. Doctor Strange starts the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pin Doctor Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable winds around his torso, then tightens around his throat.]
Stephen Strange: You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.
Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead. [Doctor Strange falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Doctor Strange away.] NO!
Tony Stark: [Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as Doctor Strange passes through the park.] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
Peter Parker: On it!
[Spider-Man chases Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Doctor Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacks him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.]
Peter Parker: [Untangles himself] Not cool!
[Maw bends all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scoops up Doctor Strange before he hits the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Doctor Strange, a cone of blue light starts pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabs a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uproots it, sending Doctor Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship.]
Peter Parker: Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!
Tony Stark: Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Iron Man to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Iron Man, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]
Tony Stark: [Iron Man shakes himself free of the Dwarf's weapon, now powerless.] Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Iron Man begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Iron Man's foot thrusters morph together into a single larger jet and increase his speed considerably.]
[Ebony Maw walks towards the controls of the ship, Doctor Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepares to leave Earth's atmosphere.]
Tony Stark: [Still in pursuit of the ship and his protege.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship.] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.
Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard! [Spider-Man, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!
Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.
Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.
[Peter passes out, free-falling, but not for long before the pod reaches him. It attaches itself to him, becoming the Iron Spider suit. Now being able to breathe, Spider-Man lands on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically.]
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!
Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yep.
[A large parachute extends from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.]
Peter Parker: OH, COME ON!
[Iron Man latches onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went.]
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.
Pepper Potts: [Sounding heavily worried] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.
Pepper Potts: Why?
Tony Stark: [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.
Pepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
Pepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God….
Tony Stark: Pep….
Pepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too….
[Spider-Man is revealed to have managed to shoot a web to the outside of the ship, foiling his parachute, and clambers inside a slowly-closing chamber.]
Peter Parker: Oh my God! [Looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus....
[Ebony Maw, hands engaged in the ship's steering mechanism, accelerates into hyperspace.]
[Meanwhile, back in New York]
[Bruce finds Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picks it up thoughtfully. Wong opens up a portal back to the Sanctum.]
Bruce Banner: Where you going?
Wong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?
Bruce Banner: [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.
[Wong nods in understanding and closes the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of the movie. Banner holds Steve Rogers' cell phone and makes a call.]
[Screen title: SPACE]
[Camera pans around a brightly colored planet with ice rings to the Benatar. The Guardians of the Galaxy are travelling to investigate a distress call to the tune of ""Rubberband Man"".]
Peter Quill: [Chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!
[Drax is snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Quill. Gamora lip-syncs with the song along with Quill.]
Rocket: [Yawns] Why are we doing this again?
Gamora: [Annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.
Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?
Peter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese [Quill rubs his thumb against his other fingers] for our help.
Gamora: [Waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.
Peter Quill: [Points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up….
Drax: We'll take his ship.
Rocket: Exactly!
Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!
[Gamora looks up at Quill in concern. Quill returns her look and grimaces a ""don't worry about it"" expression at her.]
Mantis: [Reading her console] We are arriving.
Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot.
Groot: [In a mocking tone] I am Groot! (Translation: Shut up, bitch!)
Peter Quill: Whoa!
Rocket: Language!
Gamora: Hey!
Drax: Wow.
Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.
Rocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!
[Groot rolls his eyes.]
[The Benatar decelerates, and Thanos' devastation suddenly covers the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies are seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship.]
Mantis: What happened?
Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.
[With a thump, Thor's body is plastered to the hull of the ship.]
Rocket: [Waving his hands] Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!
[Thor’s eye opens; all gasp.]
[Cut to the Guardians settling the still-unconscious Thor onto an examination table.]
Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?
Drax: [Sounding awed] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.
Peter Quill: [A little dented]  I'm muscular.
Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.
Peter Quill: Yeah, right.
Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weight…. [Drax motions to his chin and belly.]
[Gamora leaves Quill's side at Thor's right, and circles around the foot of the table.]
Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm…
Mantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?
Gamora: [Reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
Peter Quill: [Snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up.
Mantis: [Places hand on Thor's forehead] Wake.
[Thor awakens, sitting up violently and throwing himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turning to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game.]
Thor: Who the hell are you guys?
[Cut to later as the Guardians stand around Thor eating soup.]
Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....
Drax: Including my own.
Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [She snaps her fingers.]
Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.
Thor: Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.]
Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]
Thor: Families can be tough. [He claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.
[Peter glares at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moves around her to push between her and Thor.]
Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--
Thor: [Not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon…. (He attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something….
Peter Quill: What are you doing?
Thor: Taking your pod.
Peter Quill: [Clears his throat then deepens his voice] No, you're not! [Mimics Thor’s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.
Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
Peter Quill: No.
Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
Peter Quill: No I'm not.
Mantis: [Gasp] He just did it again!
Peter Quill: This is my voice!
Thor: [Steps closer to Quill] Are you mocking me?
Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?
Thor: Stop it. You did it again.
Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.
Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.
Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
Thor: Knowhere.
Mantis: He must be going somewhere.
Peter Quill: [Voice now normal] No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores.]
Thor: Not anymore.
Gamora: Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?
Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.
Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.
Thor: Or a genius.
Gamora: [To Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
Thor: There's six stones out there. [Finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.
Peter Quill: The 'Avengers'?
Thor: [By way of explanation.] Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
Mantis: Like Kevin Bacon?
Thor: [Pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.
Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
Thor: Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
Drax: That's a made up word.
Thor: All words are made up.
[It's official: mind blown.]
Rocket: Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [Climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [Increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.
Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.
Rocket: Rabbit?
Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [To Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?
Rocket: You're very perceptive.
Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.
Thor: Wonderful.
Peter Quill: Except for that I'm the captain.
Thor: Quiet!
Peter Quill: That's my backpack.
Rocket: Go sit down.
Peter Quill: [To Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to… [gropes for ""Nidavellir""] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?
Thor: The Thanos killing kind.
Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
Thor: A little bit. Yeah.
Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.
Thor: He already is.
Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.
Thor: So cool. [Smiles a big grin.]
Peter Quill: [To Rocket] For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
Rocket: You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.
Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.
[The Guardians nod or wave farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot depart. Cut to Scotland, where Vision and Wanda Maximoff are sharing a room. Wanda is in bed while Vision, in a human glamour, watches out a window.]
[High-pitched trilling]
Vision: [Gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain.]
Wanda Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?
Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.
Wanda Maximoff: What does it say?
Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something... 
[The stone trills again and Vision flinches. Wanda takes his face in her hands. Vision turns his head so he can kiss her left palm, then presses Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone.]
Vision: Tell me what you feel.
[Wanda gestures, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seems confused.]
Wanda Maximoff: I just feel you.
[They kiss. Cut to later, where the two are going on a stroll.]
 Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
Vision: What if I miss that train?
Wanda Maximoff: There is an 11.
Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?
Wanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.
Vision: I'd rather give it to you.
Wanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.
Vision: Not to each other. [He puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [Stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...
Wanda Maximoff: It works.
Vision: It works.
Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.
[Wanda looks down, but then her eyes and attention drift to her left.]
Vision: [Suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping…
[Wanda steps over to a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It shows coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark.]
Wanda Maximoff: [Fearful] What are they?
Vision: What the stone was warning me about. [He kisses her hand] I have to go.
Wanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea.
Vision: Wanda, I… [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]
Wanda Maximoff: Vision! [She circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking the Scarlet Witch across the street and through a bistro's window.]
[Corvus Glaive pins Vision down and digs the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone.]
[The Scarlet Witch commits her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifts Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where the Scarlet Witch drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway.]
Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
Wanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?
Vision: It isn't supposed to be. [His voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [The Scarlet Witch gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.
[Corvus Glaive suddenly arrives, knocking the Scarlet aside and grabbing Vision into the air,]
Wanda Maximoff: Vis!
[Corvus flies away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engages the Scarlet Witch with her staff weapon and they too begin to fight.]
Corvus Glaive: [To Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives.
[Vision flies with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof.]
[Simultaneously, Proxima and the Scarlet Witch fight below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima uses the blaster effect of her weapon to knock the Scarlet Witch meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaps down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of the Scarlet Witch's face, only held back by the Scarlet Witch's powers]
[Furiously, Vision pummels Corvus, then throws him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus uses his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflects back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him.]
[Down below, the Scarlet Witch has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she hears an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthens her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. The Scarlet Witch then flies up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.]
Wanda Maximoff: Hands off.
[The Scarlet Witch casts a bolt of magic which throws Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flies the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shoots a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawls over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand.]
Wanda Maximoff: [Hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.
Vision: Please. Please leave.
Wanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.
Vision: Please.
Wanda Maximoff: Get up.
[Behind them, Proxima and Corvus crash through the roof and advance on them, brandishing their weapons. the Scarlet Witch moves protectively in front of Vision, building power in her hands.]
[An express train passes behind Wanda, and Proxima cocks her head as if aware of another's presence. Confused, the Scarlet Witch also turns and looks over her left shoulder. As the last train car passes, we see a silhouette on the far side of the platform. Proxima throws her weapon at the shadowy figure, but it is deftly caught just before the figure steps from the shadows.]
[As the Avengers theme kicks in, we now recognize a bearded and furious Steve Rogers (Captain America) as he steps into the light. Vision and the Scarlet Witch look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson (Falcon) swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed cafe's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus.]
[At the same time, Captain America throws Proxima's weapon to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards.]
[Proxima, who has rushed back to the fight, summons her weapon back to her hand and attacks Black Widow. Captain America leaps forward, rolls, scoops up Corvus's dropped glaive and holds her off. Black Widow joins in with her own escrima sticks. While the three are fighting, Falcon returns and again kicks Proxima backwards; she scuttles over to the prone Corvus. Falcon draws both of his Steyr SPP submachine pistols on the couple.]
Proxima Midnight: [To Glaive] Get up.
Corvus Glaive: I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: [Coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
Proxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.
[Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive depart as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Captain America's hand as well.]
Sam Wilson: [To Vision] Can you stand?
Vision: [Electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain.
Steve Rogers: [Nods] Let's get you on the jet.
Natasha Romanoff: [Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda] I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.
Wanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Sam Wilson: Where to, Cap?
Steve Rogers: Home.
[Cut to the past, at Gamora's home planet Zen-Whoberi during Thanos' massacre. Gamora and her mother are hiding; the sounds of guns and screaming are outside.] 
Gamora's Mother: [To Young Gamora] Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
[An explosion goes off close by and Gamora screeches by reflex, revealing their hiding spot.]
Child of Thanos: [Untranslated inquiry.]
[The door is smashed open and both Zehobereians scream.]
[Outside, it is utter chaos. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships fly overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-cross the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arises from countless fires.]
Ebony Maw:  Zehobereians…
Young Gamora: [Being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!
Ebony Maw: Choose a side, or die.
Young Gamora: Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves.]
Ebony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.
[Gamora turns and finds herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.]
Thanos: What's wrong, little one?
Young Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?
Thanos: [Kneels down to Gamora] What's your name?
Young Gamora: Gamora.
Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small -- for him -- red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other… [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try.
[Thanos hands Gamora the dagger -- the handle is two child-palms' widths in length. She tries balancing it on her index finger.]
Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.
[One half of the crowd is shot down. The survivors scream in horror, and Gamora tries to turn but Thanos prevents her from seeing the massacre.]
Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.
[Cut to the present, aboard the GUARDIANS’ ship. Gamora is brooding, activates the spring-action blades on the same dagger.]
Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--
Gamora: I need to ask a favor.
Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.
Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.
Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?
Gamora: If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.
Peter Quill: [A beat. Confusion.] What?
Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.
Peter Quill:  What do you know?
Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.
Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?
Gamora: Only if you wanna die.
Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
Gamora: Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.
Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would… [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]
Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
Peter Quill: [A beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.
[The two kiss, until an odd crunching sound startles them. Drax is standing in the corner.]
Peter Quill: Dude. How long have you been standing there?
Drax: An hour.
Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?
Drax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.
[Drax stands motionless, then very slowly raises his hand towards his mouth]
Peter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.
Drax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.
Peter Quill: Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]
Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.
Mantis: Hi, Drax.
Drax: [Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.
[The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title: KNOWHERE.]
Peter Quill: This place looks deserted.
Drax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.
Peter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.
[The four Guardians disembark and sneak into the Collector’s collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos is threatening the Collector while the Guardians hide behind rubble.]
Collector: I don't have it.
Thanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.
[Quill stops, and holds up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walks quietly past him.]
Thanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]
Collector: [Strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?
Thanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.
Collector: Like suicide.
Thanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
Collector: I didn't know what it was.
Thanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?
Drax: Today...
Peter Quill: [Grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.
Drax: ...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
Peter Quill: Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard.] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.
Drax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
[Quill starts to struggle with Drax when Mantis puts her hand on the back of Drax's head.]
Mantis: Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]
[Thanos looks towards the sound, then picks up the Collector and throws him into a collecting case before walking towards the disturbance.]
Peter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!
[Gamora leaps on Thanos from a stack of boxes, swinging her sword at him. He snaps the sword-blade in half, and Gamora stabs him in the throat with the stub, his lower jaw sagging and himself letting out a hoarse groan, then he is stabbed in the chest with the red-jeweled dagger.]
Thanos: Why? [He falls down] Why you? Daughter… [He holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]
Peter Quill: [Surprised] That was quick.
Collector: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
[Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice fills the room.]
Thanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.
[The scene disappears -- everything in the room is destroyed and/or on fire, the Collector waving bye-bye as he and his case vanish.]
Thanos: That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want.
[Thanos is quite alive and undamaged. He has the red Reality Stone seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.]
Gamora: [Her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come.
Thanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.
[Gamora hesitates for a beat, then reaches for her broken sword. Thanos grabs her by the back of the neck and swings her around in front of him.]
Drax: Thanos!
[With a pulse of the Reality Stone, both Drax and Mantis are 'disassembled' -- Drax is turned into a stack of tumbling cubes, and Mantis becomes a ribbon version of herself.]
Peter Quill: [Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!
Gamora: Peter…
Peter Quill: [To Gamora] I told you to go right.
Gamora: Now? Really?
Peter Quill: You let her go!
Thanos: Ah, the boyfriend.
Peter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.
Gamora: Peter…
Peter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!
Gamora: Not him.
[Quill hesitates. He does not shoot anyone.]
Gamora: You promised! You promised.
Thanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill’s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!
Peter Quill: [Tearing up] I told you to go right.
Gamora: I love you, more than anything.
Peter Quill: I love you, too.
[Quill screws up his eyes and pulls the trigger -- but a stream of bubbles comes out. Thanos was playing him.]
Thanos: [Genuinely sincere] I like you.
[Thanos teleports Gamora and himself away as a stunned Quill picks up Gamora's sword, and his friends painfully re-assemble themselves, the Reality Stone's effects now subsiding in its absence.]
(Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrives at the upstate New York Avengers HQ while Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes deals with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (Lt. Gen., USA Ret.).)
Secretary Ross: Still no word from Vision?
James Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
Secretary Ross: On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
James Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?
Secretary Ross: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.
James Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.
Secretary Ross: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.
James Rhodes: [Sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [We get a good look at his leg braces]
Secretary Ross: You have second thoughts?
James Rhodes: Not anymore.
[The fugitive Avengers enter the room, Vision supported by Sam.]
Steve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.
Secretary Ross: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.
Natasha Romanoff: You could use some of that right now.
Secretary Ross: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?
Steve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Steve takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.
Secretary Ross: [To Rhodes] Arrest them.
James Rhodes: All over it. [Swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.
Steve Rogers: [Hugging Rhodes] You too, Rhodey. [Natasha gets her own embrace.]
James Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.
Sam Wilson: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.
Bruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room.]  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.
Natasha Romanoff: Hi, Bruce.
Bruce Banner: Nat.
Sam Wilson: [Whispering] This is awkward.
[Cut to a shot of Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey, Wanda, and Vision in another room.]
James Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?
Wanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.
Bruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?
Natasha Romanoff: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.
Bruce Banner: Who's Scott?
Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.
Bruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.
Natasha Romanoff: Well then, we have to protect it.
Vision: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her.]
Wanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.
Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
Wanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.
Vision: [Takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.
Steve Rogers: [Eyes diverted down] But it should. [Looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision.
Vision: [Walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?
[Steve takes a breath, but before he has a chance to answer, Bruce speaks.]
Bruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
Bruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.
Natasha Romanoff: Can we do that?
Bruce Banner: Not me. Not here.
James Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.
Steve Rogers: I know somewhere.
[Cut to rural Wakanda, as King T'Challa and Okoye walk together, accompanied by two Kingsguard. Screen title: WAKANDA.]
Okoye: You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.
T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?
Okoye: Those that are left.
T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
Okoye: And what of this one?
T'Challa: This one may be tired of war. [James ""Bucky"" Buchanan Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough.
[The party reaches Bucky. A Kingsguards-man sets an elaborate and high-tech-looking equipment case down on the cart, opens the lid, and steps back. As the Winter Soldier approaches, he sees a new Vibranium arm in the case.]
Bucky Barnes: [With resignation] Where's the fight?
T'Challa: On its way.
[Cut to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange is floating horizontally, face down, and is surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long.]
Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement. [The needles start to contact Dr. Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone.
[Cut to Tony who is watching, hidden, from above. The Cloak of Levitation taps Stark on the arm. He raises his hand to it, ready to shoot, but he sees what it is and stands down.]
Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?
Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....
[Tony and the Cloak turn to face Peter, dropping down from above]
Tony Stark: What the--
Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.
Tony Stark: You should not be here.
[The Cloak moves to ""stand"" at Tony's side]
Peter Parker: I was gonna go home--
Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.
Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...
Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.
[The Cloak shakes its collar in sympathy and shrugs]
Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.
[The Cloak looks shocked.]
Tony Stark: [Seriously] What did you just say?
Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
Tony Stark: Yeah. [Tony crosses to stand right in front of Peter] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.
Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker: It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood. [He waits for Tony's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.
Tony Stark: [Breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [He leads Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
Peter Parker: Um. Okay, okay... uh... [Peter and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?
[The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise.]
[Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly.]
Ebony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
[At the ""thump"" behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire.]
Ebony Maw: ...Could end your friend's life in an instant.
Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.
Ebony Maw: [Walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.
[Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw's right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit's metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere making haste to leave.]
Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those?!
[Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape ""standing"" next to him.]
Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met. [He offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to Dr. Strange.] Cool.
[Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked.]
Stephen Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
Stephen Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.
[Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect.]
Tony Stark: [Irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.
Stephen Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
Stephen Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
Stephen Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.
Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.
[Seriously, these two's egos are a recipe for disaster.] 
Peter Parker: [Raises his hand] I'm backup.
Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. [Waggles a finger between himself and Dr. Strange] The adults are talking.
Stephen Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?
Peter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.
Stephen Strange: Dr. Strange.
Peter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.
Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
Stephen Strange: [Walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Tony is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away.] Stark?
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Stephen Strange: Can you get us home?
Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.
Stephen Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
Tony Stark: [Stalks over to Strange] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?
Stephen Strange: [Pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.
Tony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [Stepping over to Peter, he formally taps each of Peter's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting.] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]
[Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what's to come.]
[Cut to Thanos' mother-ship, Sanctuary II, which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her.]
Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.
[Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos' throne with a loud clack.]
Gamora: I always hated that chair.
Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.
Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
Thanos: You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years.
Gamora: I was a child when you took me.
Thanos: I saved you.
Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.
Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora: You're insane.
Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.
Gamora: You don't know that!
Thanos: [Scowls as his egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [He stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.
Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.
Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [Leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [Looks at her] And you lied.
[Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain.]
Gamora: Nebula.
[Gamora hurries to to Nebula's left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality.]
Gamora: Don't do this.
Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.
Gamora: Please don't do this.
Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
[Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream.]
Gamora: Stop. Stop it. [She puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
[Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula's voice say, ""Accessing memory files"" and a sort of hologram of Gamora's face shudders to life.]
Memory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.
Memory Gamora: He can never get them all.
Memory Nebula: He will!
Memory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.
[The memory ends.]
Thanos: [To Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [His voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]
Gamora: Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir.
Thanos: [Satisfied.] Show me.
[Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir.]
Groot: [Irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: I need to tinkle.)
Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.
Groot: [Still irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: But the cup is full.)
Thor: [While looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.
Rocket: You speak Groot?
Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.
Groot: [Shortly] I am Groot. (Translation: How long 'till we get there?)
Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [Nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.
[Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs.]
Rocket: [To himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [Walks to a console near by Thor, presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.
Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.
Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?
Thor: Both dead.
Rocket: Still got a mom, though?
Thor: Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket: A best friend?
Thor: Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
Thor: [Smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.
Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.
Thor: Well, he's never fought me.
Rocket: Yeah, he has!
Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.
Rocket: Better be some hammer.
Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.
Rocket: And what if you're wrong?
Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?
[Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot.]
Rocket: [Under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [He gives Thor the eyeball.]
Thor: What's this?
Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
Thor: He gave you his eye?
Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.
[Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion.]
Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!
Thor: [Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
Rocket: It ain't the eye.
[Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it.]
Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.
[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR]
[The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game.]
Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.
Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....
Rocket: [Pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
Thor: Yes. Why?
Rocket: Look anything like that? [In fact, it looks exactly like that]
Groot: [Uneasily] I am Groot.
Thor: [Urgently] Go back to the pod.
[Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.]
Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop!
Eitri: Thor?
[Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf.]
Thor: What happened here?
Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!
Thor: Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?
Eitri: [He walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.' [He holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.]
Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed... every ax, hammer, sword... it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.
[Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together. Nebula ejects her eyepiece and snaps the neck of the tech when he comes close enough to replace it. She walks to a console, straightening her left arm, dragging her still-dislocated right foot behind her, and inputs a code.]
Nebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.
[Cut to Peter Parker, Tony Stark, and Dr. Strange aboard the ship approaching the surface of Titan.]
Peter Parker: [To Tony] Hey, what's going on?
Stephen Strange: I think we're here.
Tony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [Urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
Peter Parker: Yep, got it.
Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.
Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.
[The ringship is heading straight for the center of what looks like one of a colossal game of jacks.]
Peter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!
[Iron Man armors up as the ringship clips the ""jack"" obliquely, but still losing a good third of its hull in the collision. Spider-Man throws up his helmet at the same time. Doctor Strange steps between them and creates the Shield of the Seraphim around them all, anticipating a rough landing.]
[The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title: TITAN.]
[Doctor Strange helps Tony, now de-helmeted, to his feet; they're both panting a little from the exertion of arrival.]
Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.
[Spider-Man descends from above in classically spider-like fashion.]
Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
Tony Stark: [While pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that... something is coming.
[A grenade rolls into view, and Peter, Strange and Tony get thrown well back when it fires its energy pulse. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis appear in the doorway]
Drax: [Yelling] THANOS!!!! [He flings a blade at Doctor Strange, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Iron Man have a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pins Iron Man face-first to a structure.]
Peter Parker: [Crawling backwards frantically from an anxious-looking Mantis] AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!
[Spider-Man shoots web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flies at him feet-first, kicking him away.]
Peter Quill: Stay down, clown!
[Star-Lord can't quite counter spider reflexes at first; he fires at Spider-Man, who extends his spider legs and leaps away, but an electric-like cord wraps around Spider-Man and his six new legs when he tries to attack, sending him rolling across the deck.]
Drax: [Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!
[Iron Man pulls free of the magnet; the Cloak pulls free of Drax as soon as Iron Man has a bead on his opponent and a foot on his torso.]
[Star-Lord has Spider-Man in a head-lock, gun pointed at the smaller man's head.]
[Doctor Strange has a mystical shield of golden energy up, and stands ready at the third point of the triangle. Mantis has struggled to her feet behind Star-Lord, still covered with webbing.]
Peter Quill: Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out. [Star-Lord powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?
Tony Stark: [De-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?
Drax: I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?!
Peter Quill: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.
Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nano-tech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face.]
Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.
Mantis: No, he can't take it!
Stephen Strange: [Completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.
Peter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [To Spider-Man] Starting with you.
Stephen Strange: Wait, what. Thanos? [Trying to inject clarity and sanity into the situation] Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?
Peter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? ""Jesus""?
Tony Stark: [Getting it] You're from Earth?
Peter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?
Peter Parker: [Sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?
Peter Quill: [Indignantly] WITH Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?
Peter Parker: [De-helmets] We're the Avengers, man.
Peter Quill: Oh.
Mantis: You're the ones Thor told us about!
Tony Stark: You know Thor!?
Peter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, [Peter gives him an incredulous look] needed saving.
Doctor Strange: [Pause] Where is he now?
[Cut to Nivadellir where Eitri is showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker.]
Rocket: This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.
Thor: Did it have a name?
Eitri: Stormbreaker.
Rocket: That's a bit much.
Thor: So how do we make it?
Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.
[Cut to Titan where the remaining Avengers and the Guardians are starting to work together. Quill is measuring the planet's tilt.]
Peter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
[in the background, Mantis is jumping joyfully in a low gravity spot.]
Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.
[Drax yawns.]
Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?
Drax: I stopped listening after you said, ""We need a plan.""
Tony Stark: [To Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.
Peter Quill: See, ""not winging it"" isn't really what they do.
Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?
Mantis: [As fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass.
Drax: Yeah, that's right. [Agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the remaining Avengers.]
Tony Stark: [Tony pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?
Peter Quill: ""Mr. Lord."" Star-Lord is fine. [Motions to Drax and Mantis,]
Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....
Peter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Peter Parker follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]
Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Tony Stark: What dance-off?
Peter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.
Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?
Peter Quill: [Excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Peter Parker: It never was.
[Quill frowns sadly at him.]
Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?
Peter Parker: Okay.
Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Peter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.
Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.
Mantis: Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?
[Dr. Strange is sitting cross-legged, floating slightly above the ground, his hands poised in a mystic gesture with the Time Stone glowing brightly in the Eye of Agamotto setting. Green vapor-like energy flows from the stone, and more intricate magical energy patterns circle Dr. Strange's forearms. The Cloak of Levitation flows behind him as if the Stone is creating a strong breeze. His eyes are closed, and his head is jerking rapidly from side to side, the motion blurring, but resembling looking for something.]
Tony Stark: Strange! We alright?
[Dr. Strange snaps out of his trance and falls forward, letting out a cry.]
Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright.
Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?
Stephen Strange: [Panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
Peter Quill: How many did you see?
Stephen Strange:14,000,605.
Tony Stark: How many did we win?
[Dr. Strange stares intently at Tony for a moment.]
Stephen Strange: [Pause] One.
[Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title: VORMIR]
Thanos: The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.
[The walk up the mountain seems to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet lead up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encounter a floating hooded figure].
Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
Thanos: You know us?
Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper: You should know... it extracts a terrible price.
Thanos: I am prepared.
Stonekeeper: We all think that at first. [The figure touches down and glides out of the shadows, revealing the face of who we know to be Johann ""The Red Skull"" Schmidt from Captain America: The First Avenger.] We are all wrong.
[The Stonekeeper guides them to a temple-like structure at the summit.]
Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.
[They stop on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descends in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that runs between the two spires behind them. Far, far below is a full circle with similar engraved decoration.]
Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
Thanos: What's this?
Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.
Red Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.
Thanos: Of what?
Red Skull: In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul... for a soul.
[Gamora begins to laugh at the irony of the situation.]
Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.
Thanos: [Turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes.]
Gamora: Really? Tears?
Red Skull: They're not for him.
[Gamora looks at the Red Skull, and as her bitter smile fades, realizes what is about to happen, as do we.... ]
Gamora: No. This isn't love.
Thanos: [Thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabs the red-jeweled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggers the blades and stabs herself in the stomach... except it's only bubbles.] I'm sorry, little one. [He grabs Gamora by the arm and walks inexorably to the precipice.]
Gamora: NO!
[She tries in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Child of Thanos so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he throws her over the edge, and watches sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulses overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.]
[Thanos finds himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opens his hand and sees that he now has the orange Soul Stone.]
[Cut to the Quinjet where Sam is piloting Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision.]
Steve Rogers: [Walking up to the pilot's seat] Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
Sam Wilson: I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.
[The Quinjet passes through a camouflage force field into Wakanda's Golden City's valley and lands at the airfield outside the palace. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approach to greet the arrivals]
Okoye: [Walking with King T'Challa and a band of the Kingsguard to the landing pad] When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.
T'Challa: And what did you imagine?
Okoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
[The occupants of the Quinjet disembark, Steve and Natasha leading, followed by Bruce and Rhodey, with Vision and Wanda slowly taking up the rear.]
Bruce Banner: [To Rhodey] Should we bow?
James Rhodes: [Seriously] Yeah, he's a king.
Steve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [Shaking hands with King T'Challa.]
[Bruce bows awkwardly to King T'Challa.]
James Rhodes: [Mock shocked] What are you doing?
T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?
[The group begins to walk back into the administrative building.]
Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.
Natasha Romanoff: How we looking?
King T'Challa: You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...
Bucky Barnes: [Smiling as he walks toward Steve, passing some Kingsguard taking Vision and Wanda to another facility] A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.
[The two friends share a hug.]
Steve Rogers: How you been, Buck?
Bucky Barnes: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.
[In Shuri's lab, Shuri scans the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lies on the examination table. She flips her hand over and studies the hologram projected over her palm.]
Shuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
Bruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.
Shuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
[Vision looks at Bruce as if to ask the same thing.]
Bruce Banner: [Uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it.
Shuri: [Reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best.
Wanda Maximoff: Can you do it?
Shuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [To King T'Challa] It will take time, brother.
Steve Rogers: How long?
Shuri: As long as you can give me.
Okoye: [Her kimoyo beads chime an alarm; she flicks one bead into her palm, where it projects the globe with a pulsing location marker] Something's entered the atmosphere.
[Outside, Sam and Bucky look up at the sky]
Sam Wilson: [Over the Avengers' comm] Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.
[The defense shield over the Golden City destroys one of the alien vessels when it slams into the field at full attack acceleration.]
Bucky Barnes: God, I love this place.
James Rhodes: [also outside, and now in full War Machine armor watching three more ships burn through the sky] Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.
[The shock waves and debris from the ship landings destroy acres of forest and boil up against the dome. The lab has an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther look at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing.]
Vision: [Struggling to sit up and slide off the exam table] It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
Natasha Romanoff: [Moving toward Vision] Vision, get your ass back on the table.
T'Challa: We will hold them off. [He, Okoye and the guards head for the door.]
Steve Rogers: [To Wanda] Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.
Wanda Maximoff: I will.
T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [He stops, turns, and points at Steve] And get this man a shield.
[Cut to Nivadellir where Rocket is in the pod, and Thor, without any environmental suit, jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod.]
Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.
Thor: Leave that to me.
Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--
Thor: [Thor begins to swing the pod around him in a circle. Rocket screams. Thor builds up speed with three good loops then slacks his grip enough to send the pod shooting straight away from Nidavellir, trailing him behind it like a kite tail.] Fire the engines!
Rocket: [Rocket shakes it off and puts the proverbial pedal to the metal.] Nnnyah!
Thor: [As the pod skims over the surface of the next ring out, Thor reaches down and digs one hand into the surface, then both feet, finally getting a foothold against the forward motion of the pod. The ice-like accumulation around the ring axis crackles.] MORE... POWER... RABBIT!
[Thor commits bicep porn while Rocket accelerates for all he's worth. Finally the rings spin free, realigning into effective configuration as the star bursts back into life.]
Eitri: Well done, boy.
[Thor, clutching the pod's forward windows, points to the star.]
Thor: That's Nivadellir!
[Rocket gazes amazed at the blazing core. An iris on the cladding around the star opens, firing pure stellar heat through the ring portals and into the forge... until the damaged mechanism fails, crumbles loose and slams shut. The iris closes and the beam of light trails off.]
Eitri: Damn it.
Rocket: ""Damn it""? What's ""damn it""?
Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.
Thor: What?
Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.
Thor: How long will it take to heat?
Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?
Thor: [Standing up on the pod hull] I'm gonna hold it open.
Eitri: That's suicide.
Thor: So is facing Thanos without that ax. [He leaps from the pod to the star's iris.]
[Cut to the Wakandan battlefield. Carriers hover over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha, Steve and Bucky on board; Rhodey and Sam keep pace overhead, and Bruce is in the Hulkbuster armor.]
Natasha Romanoff: How we looking, Bruce?
Bruce Banner: [Leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-- [he stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands] I'm okay. I'm okay.
James Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
[The heat signatures are Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian.]
[The carrier pilots swerve into U-turns, causing their craft to tilt and allowing the practiced soldiers to slide over one side into a run, never coming to a complete halt. A Dora Milaje shouts a command nearby as the last Wakandans join ranks.]
Jabari Warriors: MIE EFFA! (Win them!) YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! [M'Baku, Lord of the Jabari, rallies his soldiers with a war chant. He stops as King T'Challa nears him.]
T'Challa: [Clasps wrists with M'Baku] Thank you for standing with us.
M'Baku: [Translated from Xhosa] Of course, brother.
[The Black Panther, Captain America, and Black Widow walk to the edge of the barrier, where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian stand. Proxima tests the strength of the barrier by drawing her sword across it consideringly.]
Natasha Romanoff: Where's your other friend?
Proxima Midnight: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
Steve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.
T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
Proxima Midnight: We... have blood to spare. [She brandishes her sword with a snarl, and the ships behind her start raising their outer hulls to allow their ""passengers"" to disembark.]
[The three heroes return to the massed forces.]
Bucky Barnes: [A touch sardonically] Did they surrender?
Steve Rogers: Not exactly.
[The Black Panther leads the Wakandans in the war cry ""Yibambe!"" telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier; Proxima drops her sword arm down in the signal to attack.]
Bucky Barnes: [Flatly, astonished at the numbers of Outriders] What the hell.
Natasha Romanoff: Looks like we pissed her off.
Okoye: [Horrified, as the Outriders bombard the force-field, squeezing limbs and bodies partly through only to be bisected.] They're killing themselves.
[As a few Outriders managed to squeeze through intact, the Border Tribe take a knee and raise their shields. The Kingsguard behind them level their sonic spears over their comrades' shoulders, and on Black Panther's command, fire at the approaching monsters. The Winter Soldier uses his M-249 machine gun, and Bruce fires the Hulkbuster's hand repulsors.]
Sam Wilson: [Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies, swooping to fire at them with his Steyr pistols] You seen the teeth on those things?
James Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. [He flies over the heaviest concentration of Outriders and drops a barrage of mines, all exploding fantastically.]
[Everyone notices a pack of Outriders starting to run around the force-field to the right of the defenders' position.]
Bruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision.
Steve Rogers: [Grimly] Them we better keep 'em in front of us.
Okoye: [To the Black Panther] How do we do that?
T'Challa: We open the barrier. [Putting his comm to his mouth] On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.
Dome Control: [Nervous and unsure] Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?
T'Challa: On my signal.
M'Baku: [To Okoye] This will be the end of Wakanda.
Okoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
[Captain America readies one of his Vibranium hand guards. The Black Panther shouts a command in Xhosa; the Border Tribesmen disengage their shields and stand, as the Black Panther walks out in front of them, never taking his eyes off the enemy.]
T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER! [He crosses his arms in the Wakandan salute and closes his Black Panther helmet, charging for the barrier. The heroes and leaders are at the fore of the charge. Halfway to the barrier, the Black Panther shouts into his comm] Now!
[The Outriders pour through, distracted from trying to find any other access. The Black Panther and Captain America pull ahead rapidly due to their enhancements, and literally leap into battle.]
T'Challa: [Over his comm] How much longer, Shuri?
Shuri: We've barely begun, brother. [A delicate and intricate construction of gold light hovers at her eye level; as she manipulates it, the waldo tools reproduce her commands on the Mind Stone itself.]
T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.
[Simultaneously, Thor prepares to open the iris of Nidavellir.]
Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.
Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.
Thor: Only if I die. [Takes deep breaths.]
Eitri: [Boggled] Yes. That's what... ""killing you"" means.
[Thor grasps the two levers and pulls them down and towards himself, slowly opening the iris. The stream of stellar energy blasts pasts him and into the forge once again.]
Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
[Eitri watches the metal ingots melt while Thor is looking increasingly charred. Finally, Eitri is able to tip the cauldron, pouring the metal into the mold just as Thor passes out. The jet carries him into the forge, Rocket follows hastily and landing after Thor bounces limply off a structure to land on the floor. Groot finally looks up from his game at the thump Thor's body makes.]
Rocket: [Kneeling over Thor] Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? [Thor looks far from ""okay"".]
[Eitri clumsily and urgently pulls the mold, still glowing red-hot, onto the floor, breaking it loose from its frame, then starts punching the mold itself with his metal fists to free the ax.]
Rocket: I think he's dying!
Eitri: He needs the ax! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!
[Stormbreaker's two sections -- the hammer and the ax-blade -- lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor, then scowls with determination. He stands, and extends his fingers towards Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length.Thor's fingers twitch, and the new weapon levitates in a crackle of lightning echoed by the sparks between Thor's fingers.]
[The remaining Avengers and Wakandans are struggling against the Outriders. The Winter Soldier goes down, and fights off Outrider fangs snapping at his head. Captain America and the Black Panther still fight side-by-side. War Machine hovers over the breach, pouring ammunition into the flood of bodies until a huge hammer -- Cull Obsidian's -- knocks him out of the sky and to the ground. The Hulkbuster is dogpiled and pinned.]
Bruce Banner: There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!
[Suddenly, a large beam of rainbow-hued light lands in the middle of the action, and an ax flies out of it, wreathed with lightning and tearing through the Outriders, freeing the heroes. It flies back to the light and into its master's hand just as the beam cuts out, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket [The Avengers theme swelling triumphantly at their arrival] who chambers a round in his large gun. Black Widow, Captain America and the Black Panther pause in astonishment. Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian pause in apprehension.]
Bruce Banner: [Opening the Hulkbuster's helm and laughing with joy] AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!
Thor:  BRING ME THANOS! [He charges toward the hordes of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket, lightning gathering around him until he finally launches himself into the air, lands in the densest concentration of Outriders and makes a crater where they had stood.]
[Cut to Titan, where Thanos arrives, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship.]
Stephen Strange: [Sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a ""Thanos.""
Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.
Stephen Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos: And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind Thanos and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor Strange.]
Stephen Strange: Let me guess. Your home?
Thanos: [Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [Thanos curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed -- green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy.] Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.
Stephen Strange: Genocide.
Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. [He relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan.]
Stephen Strange: [Sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.
Thanos: I'm a survivor.
Stephen Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.
Stephen Strange: [Stands] And then what?
Thanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Stephen Strange: [He summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.
Thanos: Ours? [He looks up to a see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]
Tony Stark: [Flying in] Piece of cake, Quill.
Peter Quill: [Triggers his mask and follows] Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!
[The wreckage on top of Thanos erupts in purple, as he bellows in rage. He turns the hovering fragments into a flock of bats with the Reality Stone and swarms Iron Man with them, driving him back through the ruins.]
[Spider-Man webs his eyes, and swings in to kick him in the face at the same time that Drax leaps from cover, blades in both hands, to knee-slide behind Thanos and try for a tendon slide across the back of the Titan's knee.]
[Doctor Strange jumps through a portal and summons a sword of golden energy, dueling with Thanos while Drax attacks similarly on his other side. Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange's shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground.]
[Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal.]
Peter Quill: Boom!
[The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly.]
Stephen Strange: [Whispers to the Cloak of Levitation] Do not let him close his fist. [The Cloak swoops off Doctor Strange's shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos' armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]
[Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere. Spider-Man leaps through one on Thanos' left]
Peter Parker: Magic! [He punches Thanos in the head and vanishes through a portal to the lower right before reappearing above Thanos] More magic! [He yanks Thanos' head down hard, then leaps into a portal in front of him. He leaps through another portal high and behind Thanos] Magic with a kick! [Delivers a flying kick and falls feet-first into an exit, then appears on his right] Magic with a--
[Before he can finish Thanos turns, grabbing him from the air, and throwing him to the ground, with his hand around his neck.]
Thanos: Insect!
[He then throws him at Doctor Strange, knocking them both down. Thanos finally tears the Cloak away and is then promptly surrounded by fiery explosions as Iron Man bombards him. He sucks all the flame into the gauntlet with the Power Stone and fires it in a stream at Iron Man, hitting him dead on and sending him far away, plowing through a massive fallen machine.]
[Spider-Man leaps from behind, more conventionally this time, while Thanos concentrates his fire on Iron Man, webs the gauntlet and drops down in front of him, pulling hard -- but Thanos yanks on the web-line, pulling the much lighter teenager towards him, and punching him on his way past. He tears the webbing free of the gauntlet just in time for a small spaceship to attempt to crash-land on him.]
[The ship drags Thanos along for a distance, burying him under debris. He stands just as the pilot leaps in a great arc to punch him, landing in front of him with an energy-blade at the ready.]
Thanos: Well, well.
Nebula: You should have killed me.
Thanos: Would've been a waste of parts!
Nebula: [She runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!
[Thanos punches her away. Doctor Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to pinion the gauntlet, pulling Thanos' fingers open and trying to pry the gauntlet off his hand.]
[Thanos tries to pull free, as Drax slides in from his right, kicking his knee and knocking him off-balance, then wrapping himself around Thanos' kneeling leg.]
[Star-Lord shoots a electric trap onto the ground to Thanos' right, the tangle-field holding down his unarmored hand.]
[Spider-Man swings in, webs Thanos' chest then wraps it around behind him, digging his Iron Spider legs into the ground to anchor himself.]
[Doctor Strange opens a portal straight above Thanos' out of which drops Mantis, landing on the Titan's shoulders, her hands on his temples. He bellows as she tries to put him under.]
[Iron Man, having returned, is pulling on the gauntlet. Doctor Strange reapplies the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to reinforce the trap's hold on Thanos' right hand, and the Cloak helps him pull. Thanos is finally subdued enough to incapacitate, not fully asleep.]
Tony Stark: [While pulling] Is he under? Don't let up.
Mantis: [Starting to cry] Be quick. He is very strong.
Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here. [Spider-Man drops his web-line, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.
Peter Quill: [Flies over to join the others, stands in front of Thanos, tauntingly] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?
Thanos: My... Gamora...?
Peter Quill: No, bullshit. Where is she?
Mantis: [Shocked] He is in anguish.
Peter Quill: Good.
Mantis: [Crying] He… he… mourns.
Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?!
Nebula: Gamora.
Peter Quill: [Pause] What?
Nebula: [Realizing with horror and sadness what has happened] He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.
Tony Stark: [Frasps the danger immediately and de-helmets] Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?
[Quill slowly turns to Thanos,]
Tony Stark: [Shouting his pleads desperately] Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!
Peter Quill: Tell me she's lying. [Enraged] ASSHOLE! Tell me you didn't do it!
Thanos: I... had... to.
Peter Quill: [While starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't… ! No, you didn't… ! [He continues to rage and then pistol-whipping Thanos twice in the face, causing Mantis to let go in pain.] NO, YOU DIDN'T!
Tony Stark & Drax: Quill!
[Iron Man leaps for Star-Lord's arm, re-helmeting and leaving Spider-Man to pull off the gauntlet.]
Tony Stark: [To the struggling Star-Lord] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!
Peter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! [Getting the fingers completely loose] I got it! I got it.... !
[Thanos wakes completely, now well and truly furious. He head-butts Mantis, grabbing the cuff of the gauntlet just as it is sliding off his hand, causing Spider-Man to stumble back, and then throwing Mantis away off his shoulders.]
Peter Parker: [Seeing Mantis with far too much air under her] Oh, God. [He jumps and wraps his arms and legs around her, extending his spider legs to form a roll cage for a safe landing.]
[Thanos kicks Drax off his right leg and into Nebula and Star-Lord, knocking them down. He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious.]
[Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan's moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon's surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound.]
[Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone's removal; Wanda stands by tensely]
[The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian's chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground. The Black Panther gets free of his other sorties, leaps and uses all his collected kinetic energy behind a punch that lays Obsidian flat.]
Rocket: [Having found a clear spot] Come and get some, space dogs! [Another wave of Outriders heads right for the raccoon-oid. The Winter Soldier, having come up behind Rocket, grabs him with his mechanical arm, holds him at arms length and spins 540 degrees, firing his own M-249 at the same time.] Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some! [The Winter Soldier drops Rocket, who looks up at him with an impressed gleam] How much for the gun?
Bucky Barnes: [Snaps off another burst] Not for sale.
Rocket: Okay, how much for the arm? [The Winter Soldier just gives him a look and moves off] Oh, I'll get that arm.
[The tides of battle cause Thor, using Stormbreaker to great effect, and Captain America together. They take a breather.]
Steve Rogers: [Panting] New haircut?
Thor: [Grinning] Notice you've copied my beard.
[Captain America nods, wearily gesturing at his own face with a shield-covered hand. Groot skewers three Outriders with his right arm.]
Thor: By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. [Gestures towards Groot with Stormbreaker]
Groot: [In full battle snarl] I am GROOT! (Translation: You gonna help me or what?!)
Steve Rogers: [Formally, but bemused] I... I am Steve Rogers.
[In Shuri's lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths.]
T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!
[Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision]
James Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.
Sam Wilson: I'm doing it. [The two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot.]
[Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they're suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look.]
Okoye: [A touch indignant] Why was she up there all this time?
[The Children of Thanos help answer that question.]
Proxima Midnight: She's on the field. Take it.
[Corvus Glaive kills one of the guards just outside the lab, alerting Shuri to the problem. She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision's systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor.]
[Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him. Vision is, in fact, charging at him and knocking him out the window to fall many meters down the face of Mount Bashenga.]
Sam Wilson: Guys, we got a Vision situation here. [He's tackled by a leaping Outrider and grounded.]
Steve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!
Bruce Banner: I got him! [Bruce has figured out the Hulkbusters repulsor thrusters and makes a beeline for the android.]
Wanda Maximoff: On my way. [She is clobbered by Proxima Midnight's pommel and rolls down into the large ditch from the Thresher before she can move.]
Proxima Midnight: [Jumping down next to the Scarlet Witch] He'll die alone. As will you.
Natasha Romanoff: She's not alone.
[Okoye silently brandishes her spear on the other side of Proxima and nods at Black Widow.]
Proxima Midnight: Euuyaaah! [She leaps for Black Widow, who has joined her sticks into a full staff. She blocks Proxima's blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]
[Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand's repulsor at each.]
Bruce Banner: Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- [Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce's right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian's hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]
Bruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now! [Obsidian pulls the Hulkbuster up and kicks it in the small of the back.] [Trying to change into the Hulk while fighting Cull Obsidian in the Hulkbuster armor] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. [Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor's hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce's back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster's whole arm] Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!
Hulk: [Banner's face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!
Bruce Banner: Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself! [To Obsidian] Come on!
[He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls.]
Bruce Banner: See ya! [The repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air -- high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.] Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.
[Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away.]
[Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision's shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android's chest.]
Corvus Glaive: I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. [He yanks his blade out, and Vision collapses. As he bends over his fallen opponent to retrieve the Stone, he's tackled by Captain America at full speed.]
Steve Rogers: Get outta here! [He exchanges blows with Glaive, using his arm-shields as offence as well as defense, then turns to Vision again] GO!
[Black Widow splits her staff back into a pair of sticks to block Proxima Midnight's sword blows, and finally knocks it from her hand. The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow's neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering.]
Natasha Romanoff: That was really gross.
[Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive's staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien's hands just before he's thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive's hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America's struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive's chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive's corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively.]
Steve Rogers: [helping him back up] I thought I told you to go.
Vision: We don't trade lives, Captain.
[The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet's surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he's freaking out emotionally.]
Peter Parker: [Webs Mantis] I got you! I got you! [Snags Drax, securing both of them to something not moving] I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! [Reels in Star-Lord]
[The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone.]
[Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master.]
[Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos' hand.]
Thanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.
Stephen Strange: [as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto] No!
Thanos: [He snaps the Eye off its chain] Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. [He crushes it in his bare hand] A fake. [He throws Doctor Strange hard enough that Doctor Strange's head hits stone and he passes out.]
[Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance.]
Tony Stark: [sounding just about done with the Titan] You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.
Thanos: Stark.
Tony Stark: You know me?
Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
Tony Stark: My only curse is you. [Small rockets pop out of Iron Man's back and launch at Thanos.]
Thanos: Come on!
[The rockets all explode on target, momentarily shrouding Thanos in smoke. Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.]
[Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man's helmet off, revealing Tony's surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.]
[Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek.]
Thanos: [Panting] All that for a drop of blood.
[He smiles briefly punches Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side. The fight is over.]
[Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony's head.]
Thanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. [He lets go, straightens and steps back] I hope they remember you.
[Tony's just a little distracted with the pain, and blood drooling out of his mouth, and compromised breathing.]
[Thanos raises the gauntlet, closing his fist, all four Stones glowing]
Stephen Strange: Stop! [Sitting up and sounding entirely damaged] Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.
Thanos: No tricks. [Doctor Strange shakes his head as Thanos points all four Stones at him instead.]
Tony Stark: Don't... !
[Doctor Strange reaches up and plucks the Time Stone out of its hiding place in the stars. He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince.]
Thanos: One to go. [An energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise.]
Peter Quill: [Screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos.]
[Thanos doesn't even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves. Star-Lord flies through where Thanos had been and crashes, rolling several times]
Peter Quill: [Standing and de-helmeting] Where is he?!
[Tony stitches up his stab wound as well as he can with his suit functions; he has no breath for answers.]
Peter Quill: [Now fearful instead of furious] Did we just lose?
Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange, sadly, who has given the Time Stone to Thanos] Why would you do that?
Stephen Strange: We're in the Endgame now.
[M'Baka bashes another Outrider -- the ground game has improved considerably with the addition of the God of Thunder. His tribesmen are equally successful around him.]
M'Baku: MAYEFA!
Jabari Warriors: YA HU HU!
[Thor is in the air, using Stormbringer on the Outrider drop ships which are now retreating. He is having considerably more success than the Wakandan Dragon fliers firing on the fleeing ships.]
Wanda Maximoff: [landing as she finally locates Vision] Are you okay? [Vision flinches in pain before he can answer] What? What is it?
Vision: He's here.
[The wind picks up. It feels... strange. Eerie.]
Steve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. [He is joined by the Black Widow, Falcon, Okoye and the Black Panther in short order.]
Natasha Romanoff: What the hell?
Bruce Banner: [Bruce sees the blue-black clouds of a Space Stone relocation just before Thanos steps forward, and confirms this isn't just another member of the Black Order] Cap. That's him.
Steve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.
[Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place.]
[Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow.]
[The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently.]
[Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight.]
Vision: Wanda. It's time.
Wanda Maximoff: No.
Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.
Wanda Maximoff: Don't.
Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.
Wanda Maximoff: I can't.
Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.
Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair.
Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. [The Scarlet Witch extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]
[The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside.]
[The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone.]
[Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth.]
[Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily.]
[The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort.]
[Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America's efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible.]
[The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway.]
Vision: [Very softly] It's all right. It's all right. I love you.
[At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision's face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda's and Thanos' energy subsides.]
Thanos: [Walking closer to the Scarlet Witch] I understand, my child. Better than anyone.
Wanda Maximoff: [Snarls] You could never.
Thanos: [Reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort] Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. [He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor Strange made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]
Wanda Maximoff: No! [She lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]
[Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision's forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations.]
[As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos' chest. ]
Thor: [Lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.] I told you. You'd die for that. [reffering to the deaths of Loki and Heimdall]
[He takes hold of the back of Thanos' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain]
Thanos: [Weakly] You should have... you... [suddenly stronger] You should have gone for the head. [He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]
Thor: NO!
[The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a child and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi.]
Thanos: Daughter?
[the child turns around revealing to be Young Gamora.]
Gamora: Did you do it?
Thanos: Yes.
Gamora: [Beat] What did it cost?
Thanos: [Solemnly] Everything.
[Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to normal reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing.]
Thor: What'd you do? [Angrily] WHAT'D YOU DO?!
[Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground.]
Steve Rogers: [Stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side] Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?
Bucky Barnes: Steve?
[Bucky suddenly stumbles over, drops his gun and collapses into ashes, much to Steve's shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky's ashes evaporated disbelievingly.]
[On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M'Baku's horror.]
T'Challa: [While reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [King T'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. He suddenly disintegrates into ashes and, in anguish, Okoye falls back on the ground. Few seconds later, she gets up herself.]
Okoye: Kumkani?!
Groot: [Slowly corrodes into ashes as well by Rocket] I am Groot... [TRANSLATION: ""Dad?""]
[off-screen Okoye repeats herself]
Rocket: No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no...
[Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth.]
James Rhodes: [Searching for Sam, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? [Back to Okoye is is whimpering for her disintegrated king] Sam, where you at?!
[On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own.]
Mantis: Something's... happening. [She disintegrates into ashes.]
[Quill looks behind him as he sees Drax disintegrate]
Drax: [To Quill as he dissolves] Quill?
[Quill stares in horror as he turns back to Stark.]
Tony Stark: [Staring panicked at the slowly fading Quill] Steady, Quill.
Peter Quill: Oh, man. [Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]
Stephen Strange: [Calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [He finally gets erased.]
Peter Parker: [Realizes he's fading away] Mr. Stark? [Stark stares horrified at Parker,] I don't feel so good...
Tony Stark: [Trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror] You're all right?
Peter Parker: [Stumbling and terrified] I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't-- [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight while beginning to cry.] I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... [There is a short silence before Peter speaks again] I'm sorry. [Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark's arms.]
[Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief.]
Nebula: [To Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory.] He did it.
[Stark mourns silently at their failure. Back on Wakanda, the remaining team members, Captain America, Thor, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, and Rocket are left mourning near Vision's dead body. Captain America turns over Vision's bleached corpse as Black Widow runs up to the other survivors.]
James Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?
Steve Rogers: [Pause] Oh, God.
[Meanwhile, in a different place, in a rustic house on a terraced slope with a scarecrow made of discarded armor, Thanos sits down and watches the sun rise.]


[In the mid-credits scene, nothing is shown. But 2 voices are heard.] 
Nick Fury: Still no word from Stark?
Maria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [Receives three beeps from her device.]
[The screen now shows Nick Fury and Maria Hill on Earth, driving in a car.]
Nick Fury: What is it?
Maria Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
Nick Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?
Maria Hill: Ten times bigger.
Nick Fury: Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- -
Maria Hill: [warning] Nick, Nick! [A car spirals out of control in front of them. They get out and Hill checks on the passengers.]
Nick Fury: They okay?
[Behind their vehicle, a motorcycle lies in the middle of the street with a concerned citizen approaching it.]
Maria Hill: There's no one here.
[They hear helicopter rotor sounds from the direction they'd come, but it sounds wrong -- a Leonardo executive helicopter, tail rotor smoking from damage already, appears and crashes nose-first into a building. Screaming intensifies. The two are now witnessing civilians around them suddenly disintegrating.]
Nick Fury: Call Control. Code Red.
Maria Hill: [looks at her hands] Nick?
[Fury turns around to see Hill disintegrating.]
Nick Fury: Hill?
[Fury then races back to their car and gets a what appears to be an old pager with extra gear attached out of his bag on the back seat. He sends out an emergency alert, mere seconds before his hand turns into ashes.]
Nick Fury: Oh, no. Motherf--
[Before he could finish the line, Fury corrodes to dust. The pager falls to the ground, red lights blinking on the additions; the camera zooms in and we see the device display ""SENDING..."" then display a red-blue-and-gold star insignia -- the symbol of Captain Marvel.] [Cut to black.]

                         BLACK PANTHER




                          Written by 

                Ryan Coogler & Joe Robert Cole





         EXT. DEEP SPACE

         A dark screen is lit up by twinkling stars .

                         SON
          Baba?

                         FATHER
          Yes, my son?

                         SON
          Tell me a story .

                         FATHER
          Which one?

                         SON
          The story of home .
         A meteorite drifts into frame , heading towards tiny Earth off
         in the distance.

                         FATHER
          Millions of years ago , a meteorite
          made of vibranium, the strongest
          substance in the universe struck
          the continent of Africa affecting
          the plant life around it.

         The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals
         affected by vibranium.

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          And when the time of man came , five
          tribes settled on it and called it
          Wakanda. The tribes lived in
          constant war with each other until
          a warrior shaman received a vision
          from the Panther goddess Bast who
          led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
          plant that granted him super human
          strength , speed, and instincts.



         A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands
         from the sand animation, and we see them unite , and then
         break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the
         conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite
         the tribes .

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          The warrior became King and the
          first Black Panther , the protector
          of Wakanda .

                         (MORE)

          2.

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          Four tribes agreed to live under
          the King's rule , but the Jabari
          tribe isolated themselves in the
          mountains.

         We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain
         region.

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          The Wakandans used vibranium to
          develop technology more advanced
          than any other nation , but as

         as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on

         as N'Jobu peers out a window , then clears the maps from the
         table and unrolls a tapestry on the wall , hiding a bulletin
         board. James cocks a handgun.

                         LATER
         We see a black man in high-end street wear , around 30 years
         old . A RING hangs on a gold chain around his neck . This is

         ERIK KILLMONGER .
         Killmonger stands dangerously close to the glass containing
         SEVERALWEST AFRICAN ARTIFACTS They range from what looks

          .
         like iron gardening tools to masks and short range weapons.
         Flanking the room are TWOSECURITY GUARDS slight
          , l y unnerved
         by his presence .
         We follow the MUSEUM DIRECTOR a British
          , woman (mid-40's) as
         she enters and walks up behind Killmonger as he studies t he
         war masks .

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          Good morning ! How can I help you?

                         KILLMONGER
          I was just checking out these
          artifacts . They tell me you're the
          expert .

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          You could say that.

                         KILLMONGER
          They're beautiful .
         Killmonger points at one of the masks .

                         KILLMONGER (CONT'D)
          Where's this one from?

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          From the Bobo Ashanti Tribe ,
          prese nt da y Ghana . 19th Century .

                         KILLMON GER
          For real? What about this one?

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          That one's from the Edo people of
          Benin . 16th Century .

                         KILLMONGER
          Now, tell me about this one .
         Killmonger points to a MINING TOOL off to the side.

          16.




                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          Also from Benin . 7th Century. Fula
          tribe I believe .

                         KILLMONGER
          Nah.

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR

                         (AMUSED)
          I beg your pardon?

                         KILLMONGER
          It was taken by British soldiers in
          Benin but it's from Wakanda and
          it's made out of vibranium . Don't
          trip, I'mma take it off your hands
          for you.
         She looks at Killmonger like he's crazy .

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          These items aren't for sale.

                         KILLMONGER
          How do you think your ancestors got
          these? You think they paid a fair
          price? Or did they take it like
          they took everything else .

                         MUSEUM DIRECTOR
          Sir , I'm going to have to ask you
          to leave .
         The Museum Director subtly looks back at the security guards ,
         then makes a face and touches her stomach -- indigestion .
         Killmonger smiles and leans over, whispering in her ear .

                         KILLMONGER
          You got all this security watching
          me ever since I walked in. But , you
          ain't checking for what you put in
          your body .
         The museum director looks at Killmonger in terror as a
         security guard walks up behind him .

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Alright, mate. Let's have it . Come
          on , mate.

                         KILLMONGER
          I think she might not be feelin'
          too good .

          17.




         The Museum Director suddenly slumps to the floor, clutching
         her stomach .

                         KILLMONGER (CONT'D)
          Hey! Hey somebody get some help !
          Come here! Call a doctor, please!

         Uneasy, the security guards follow Klaue's instructions only
         to have KLAUEAND LIMBANI draw silenced pistols and rapidly
         shoot two of the three dead . Klaue looks at the one
         remaining.

                         KLAUE
          Hey come here. Come here! It ' s ok.
          You can go , but just don't tell

         The SECURITY GUARDlooks back at him unsure, then takes off .
         Klaue then aims and shoots the Security Guard in the back .
         Killmonger looks on at him confused .

                         KILLMONGER
          Bro, why you 'aint just shoot h im
          right here?

                         KLAUE

         Klaue looks down at the slumped bodies of the guards. Turns

          Now... let's see if you know what
          you're talking about .. .
         Klaue removes his glove to reveal a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand .

         Klaue walks up to the PROTECTIVE GLASS surrounding a smaller
         case containing the mining tool and places his hand on it . An
         invisible charge SHATTERS the glass.

          KLAUE (CONT' D)
          That's just a taste .
         Klaue picks up the MINING HAMMER studying

         Klaue ' s hand SIZZLES BLUE and centuries of MUCKand GRUNGE

         smells it , and smiles.

         taking only the vibranium head .

                         KILLMONGER

         crafted and slightly haunting . He slides th e mask inside the

         Zuri puts the Panther mask on T'Challa .
         M'Baku grins and places a WOODEN GORILLA MASKover his face .
         He clenches his fist and calls out for his Jabari soldiers to
         form a semicircle behind him , pointing their spears at his
         back.
         T'Challa lifts his hand and calls out for the Dora, who fall
         into place behind him, making a perfect CIRCLE OF SPEARS
         surrounding the fighters.
         Zuri raises his hand, ill-at-ease .

                         ZURI
          Let the challenge begin!
         The warriors CLASH, both with great skill . M'Baku with
         superior strength. T'Challa eludes a salvo of swings, then is
         driven back by the tip of M'Baku's spear against his shield.
         Knocking M'Baku's spear free, T'Challa is HAMMERED ONTO HIS
         BACKbut instantly springs up to dodge more attacks and
         counter with TWOFIERCE KICKS.
         M'Baku spits blood and bangs his chest. The rest of the
         Jabari warriors RESPOND. T'Challa salutes the crowd and they
         respond LOUDER!
         M'Baku charges at T'Challa , knuckle-walking , and slipping his
         assault , T'Challa grabs M'Baku's spear and cartwheels over it
         to land another KICK.
         The two continue to battle, BLOCKINGand TRADINGBLUNT
         STRIKES, until M'Baku delivers a backhand that KNOCKS
         T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near the Dora's spears.
         With the deadly spears at his back, T'Challa blocks COLOSSAL
         OVERHEAD BLOWSwith his shield, then M' Baku leans with all
         his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS.
         Clubbing M'Baku to his heels , T'Challa rushes forward for an
         aerial attack only to be met by a VICIOUS KICK to the chest ,
         causing him to LOSE both his shield and spear!

                         M'BAKU
          Where is your God, now?!
         Defenseless, T'Challa DODGESSPEAR-SWIPES before M'Baku
         corrals him into a BEAR HUG and delivers a CRUSHINGHEADBUTT.

         T'Challa comes out of the dirt . There are stars above . He's
         in a VAST GRASSLAND somewhere in Wakanda with wondrous acacia
         trees . It's surreal and beautiful.

          28 .



         A massive ACACIA TREE stands in front of him . T'Challa sees
         several YELLOW EYES looking at him and realizes PANTHERSare
         resting on the branches of the tree . T'Challa approaches. A
         large panther jumps down , then stands on two feet to reveal
         it's T'CHAKA .
         T'Challa lo oks at his father and immediately pulls him into a
         hug.

          I am not ready, Baba.

                         T'CHAKA

                         (IN XHOSA)
          Have you not prepared to be King
          your whole life? Have you not
          trained and studied, been by my
          side?

                         T'CHALLA
          That is not what I am talking

          you.

                         T'CHAKA
          A man who has not prepared his

          You're going to struggle. So you
          need to surround yourself with
          people you trust . You're a good man
          with a good heart . And it's hard

         T'Challa breathes in deeply , coughing up dirt . His battle
         wounds have healed.

                         T'CHALLA

         EXT. STEP TOWN, GOLDENCITY - DAY

         A bustling futuristic metropolis. T ' Challa and Nakia stroll
         side by side . FOUR DORAMILAJE shadow them from a distance.

                         T'CHALLA
          Corne home , Nakia .

                         NAKIA
          I'm right here .

                         T'CHALLA
          Stay.

                         NAKIA
          I came to support you , and to honor
          your father. But I can't stay. It's
          just ... ! found my calling out
          there . I've seen too many in need
          just to turn a blind eye . I can't
          be happy here knowing that there's
          people out there who have nothing .
         T'Challa thinks on this .

          30 .




                         T'CHALLA
          What would you have Wakanda do
          about it?
         Nakia thinks for a bit .

                         NAKIA
          Share what we have. We could
          provide aid and access to
          technology and refuge to those who
          need it ... other countries do it,
          we do it better.

                         T' CHALLA
          We are not like these other
          countries, Nakia. If the world
          found out what we truly are, and
          what we possess -- we could lose
          our way of life.

                         NAKIA
          Wakanda is strong enough to help
          others and protect ourselves at the
          same time .
         Nakia gives T'Challa a look .

                         T'CHALLA
          If you were not so stubborn you
          would make such a great queen.

                         NAKIA
          I would make a great queen because
          I am so stubborn .

                         T' CHALLA
          Ah! So you admit it !

                         NAKIA
          . .· if that's what I wanted !

          Foreign aid ... refugee programs.
         W'Kabi shakes his head.

                         W'KABI
          You let refugees in , they bring
          their problems with them. And then
          Wakanda is like everywhere else.
         T'Challa thinks on this.

                         W'KABI (CONT'D)
          Now, if you said you wanted me and
          my men to go out there and clean up
          the world , then I'd be all for it.

                         T'CHALLA
          But waging war on other countries
          has never been our way .
         Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.

          T' CHALLA (CONT'D)
          You too, huh?

                         W' KABI
          Bast, are we in trouble?
         Their beads combine to project a display of Okoye .

         a golden pyramid, T' Challa , W'Kabi, Ramonda and ELDERS from
         each tribe except the Jabari sit in a circle as Okoye briefs
         them . W'Kabi and Ramonda flank T'Challa's throne .

                         OKOYE
          A misidentified Wakandan artifact
          was stolen yesterday from a British
          museum . We have learned Ulysses
          Klaue plans to sell the vibraniurn
          to an American buyer in South Korea
          tomorrow night .
         There are audible murmurs at the name of Ulysses Klaue .

                         T'CHALLA
          Klaue has escaped our pursuits for
          almost 30 years. Not capturing him
          was perhaps my father's greatest
          regret . I wish to bring Klaue back
          here to stand trial .

          MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER
          Wakanda does not need a warrior
          right now . We need a King .

                         W'KABI
          My parents were killed when he
          attacked . Not a day goes by when I
          do not think about what Klaue took
          from us, from me.

                         OKOYE
          It's too great an opportunity to
          pass.

                         W'KABI
          Take me with you . We'll take him
          down together side by side, eh?

                         T'CHALLA
          I need you here protecting the
          border.

          33 .



                         W'KABI
          Then I ask, you kill him where he
          stands , or you bring him back to
          us .

                         T'CHALLA
          You have my word I will bring him
          back.

                         (BEAT)
          We will proceed with the mission .

          You sure it's a good idea to take

          And what are these?

                         SHURI
          The real question is what are
          those? Why do you have your toes
          out in my lab?
         Shuri points at T'Challa's traditional sandals . T'Challa

                         T'CHALLA
          What , you don't like my royal
          sandals? I wanted to go old school

          And I made them completely sound

         T'Challa spots a GAUDIERGOLDTOOTHNECKLACE. She notices .

          SHUR! (CONT'D)
          Do you like that one?

                         T'CHALLA
          Tempting . But the idea is to not be
          noticed . This one .
         Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.

          SHUR!
          (pointing at the necklace)
          Now tell it to go on.
         T'Challa does, and without warning, MILLIONS of vibranium
         laced NANITES spill from the necklace and form a new BLACK
         PANTHERSUIT around the mannequin.

          SHUR! (CONT'D)
          Oooh! ! The entire suit sits within
          the teeth of the necklace . Strike
          it .

                         T'CHALLA
          Anywhere?

          SHUR!
          Mhm.



         T'Challa turns to the mannequin in a relaxed fighting stance .
         Shuri nods and T' Challa SPIN KICKS the shit out of the
         mannequin!

          SHUR! (CONT'D)
          Not that hard, genius!

                         T'CHALLA
          You told me to strike it, you
          didn't say how hard .
         Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the
         same spot .

          SHUR!
          I invite you to my lab, and you
          just kick things around .

                         T'CHALLA
          Well maybe you should make it a
          little stronger , eh?
         Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit
         GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed.
         T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script .

                         T'CHALLA (CONT'D)
          Wait a minute .

                         SHURI
          The nanites absorb the kinetic
          energy and hold it in place for
          redistribu t ion .

                         T'CHALLA
          Very nice.

                         SHURI
          Now strike it again , in the same
          spot .
         T'Challa backs up for a kick. Shuri presses record on her
         Kimoyo . T'Challa sees this and looks at her suspiciously .

                         T'CHALLA
          You are recording?

          SHUR!

         Don't Pass. All of the SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the dice.

                         ROSS (CONT'D)
          You really need to leave, now.
         They watch the dice roll . They land on 3. The dea l er takes
         away Ross' bet , and slides T'Challa's massive payout over to
         him .

                         T' CHALLA
          Klaue is leaving out that door with
          me. You've been warned.
         T'Challa walks toward another craps table , leaving the pile
         of chips behind (money means nothing to him) .

                         ROSS
          (to the empty chair)
          Hey, you won .
         Ross scratches his brow as a THIRSTY GAMBLER(Stan Lee) who
         was sitting next to T'Challa grabs them .
         Ross eyes the Thirsty Gambler who shrugs .

                         THIRSTY GAMBLER
          You know what, I think I'll just
          take these , bring 'em over here and
          hold on for safe keeping .
         He slides them all onto the DON'T PASS bet and Ross walks off
         in search of T'Challa .

                         ROSS

                         (INTO COMM)

         T'Challa stands at a ROULETTETABLE when Ross walks up to
         him.

          Your uncle took a War Dog
          assignment in America . Your father
          placed me there to observe
          unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell
          in love with an American woman.
          They had a child . The hardships he
          saw there radicalized your uncle.

          Their leaders have been
          assassinated , communities flooded
          with drugs and weapons , they are
          overly policed and incarcerated.
          All over the planet our people
          suffer because they don't have the
          tools to fight back. With vibranium
          weapons they could overthrow every

         Ross suddenly opens his eyes and reaches for his gunshot
         wound finding it astonishingly almost fully healed.
         Shuri tinkers with the circuitry of a PAIR OF MASSIVE CLAWED
         VIBRANIUMGAUNTLETS across the room as Ross sits up.

                         ROSS
          Alright, where am I?
         Startled, Shuri spins .

                         SHURI
          Don't scare me like that,
          colonizer .

                         ROSS
          Colon-who? My name is Everett .

                         SHURI
          Yes , I know . Everett Ross former
          airforce pilot and now, CIA.

          74 .




                         ROSS
          Right.
         Groggy, Ross gazes around at the completely unique
         technology .

                         ROSS (CONT'D)
          Ok, is this Wakanda?

          SHUR!

                         (STILL WORKING)
          No, it ' s Kansas .

          ... How long ago was Korea?

          SHUR!
          Yesterday .

                         ROSS
          I don't think so . Bullet wounds
          don't just magically heal
          overnight.

          SHUR!
          They do here. But not by magic , by
          technology.

                         (BEAT)
          Don't touch anything . My brother
          will return soon.
         Leery, Shuri watches Ross wander about out of the corner of
         her eye . He walks over to the observation deck and gazes in
         awe at the exposed GLOWING ROCKS inside of the VIBRANIUM

         MINE.
         Suddenly an AUTOMATED MINING CART whips between light panels,
         floating above a rail .

                         ROSS
          These train things ... that's
          magnetic levitation, right?

          SHUR!
          Obviously.

                         ROSS
          Obviously ... but I've never seen it
          this efficient . The light panels,
          what are they?

          SHUR!
          Sonic stabilizers .

          75 .




                         ROSS
          Sonic what?

          SHUR!
          In it's raw form , vibranium is too
          dangerous to be transported at that
          speed , so I developed a way to
          temporarily deactivate it.

                         ROSS

                         (IN DISBELIEF)
          There's vibranium on those trains?

                         SHURI
          There is vibranium all around us.
          That's how I healed you.
         Ross tries to process this as a 3D PROJECTION OF OKOYE
         unexpectedly forms.

                         OKOYE'$ PROJECTION
          Where is T'Challa? His Kimoyo beads
          have been switched off .
         Ross, amazed , tries to touch the sand projection .

          SHUR!
          Well we are not joined at the hip ,
          Okoye .

                         OKOYE'$ PROJECTION

          W'Kabi is transporting him as we

          An outsider?

          No, a Wakandan .
         An IMAGE OF KILLMONGER
          from the border appears on Shuri's
         monitor .
         Then . . . Ross slowly walks into sight, staring at the screen .

          76 .

          Well look at what I have done. I
          should have taken you back long
          ago .
         Young Killmonger has now been replaced by adult Killmonger,
         who sheds a tear .

                         N'JOBU (CONT'D)
          Instead, we are both abandoned
          here.

                         KILLMONGER
          Well maybe your home is the one
          that's lost . That's why they can't
          find us.
         N'Jobu stares at his son , heartbroken .

         conquer the world . He gasps for air .
         As he climbs to his feet encircled by Kingsguard and shamans .

                         SHAMAN
          Breathe, my King . Breathe !

         Reveling in the power of the Heart Shaped Herb, Killmonger
         walks toward a dirt plot filled with the HEART SHAPEDHERBS .
         The shamans trail behind him .

                         KILLMONGER
          The Heart Shaped Herb did that?
         The shaman nods.

          91.




                         KILLMONGER(CONT'D)
          This is all of it?

                         SHAMAN
          Yes . So when it comes time for
          another King, we will be ready .

                         KILLMONGER
          Another King .. . yea go ahead and
          burn all that .
         Alarmed , the shamans don't move, hoping Killmonger doesn't
         mean it ... but he does .

                         SHAMAN
          My King , we cannot do that . It is
          our tradition --
         Killmonger smiles , the n quick l y grabs the Shaman by the
         throat .

                         KILLMONGER
          When I tell you to do something , I
          mean that shit . Burn it all !
         He lets her go as she gasps for air . Shell-shocked , the
         shamans move into action .

                        ON NAKIA
         Nakia digs out a flawless Heart Shaped Herb and in an instant
         darts back for the catacombs , glancing back at Killmonger
         from the shadows .

         Killmonger strolls in , wearing the new gold panther necklace .

          92.



                         KILLMONGER
          You know, where I'm from, when
          black folks started revolutions ,
          they never had the firepower or
          resources to fight their
          oppressors . Where was Wakanda? Hmm?
          Yea all that ends today. We got
          spies embedded in every nation on
          Earth . Already in place .
         Killmonger stands and walks looking each of them in the eye.

                         KILLMONGER (CONT'D)
          I know how colonizers think. So
          we're gonna use their own strategy
          against them . We' re gonna send
          vibranium weapons out to our War
          Dogs . They'll arm oppressed people
          all over the world, so they can
          finally rise up and kill those in
          power, and their children and
          anyone else who takes their side .
          It ' s time they know the truth about
          us . We're warriors. The world's
          gonna start over and this time
          we're on top .
         Killmonger sits .

                         KILLMONGER(CONT'D)
          The sun will never set on the
          Wakandan Empire.
         Okoye looks to W'Kabi .

                         OKOYE
          Wakanda has survived for so long by
          fighting when only absolutely
          necessary.

                         W'KABI
          Wakanda has survived in the past
          this way , yes. But the world is
          changing , General . Elders , it is
          getting smaller. The outside world
          is catching up and soon it will be
          the conquerors , or the conquered .
          I'd rather be the former .

                         KILLMONGER
          You heard your orders. Let's get to
          it.
         W'Kabi salutes while Okoye looks on .

         Nakia leads Shuri, Ramonda and Ross through the bitter wind
         and harsh conditions .

                         ROSS
          So where are we going again?

                         NAKIA
          We're taking the Heart Shaped Herb
          to Jabariland .

                         ROSS
          Heart Shaped Herb , what is that?

                         SHURI
          It gives whoever takes it
          heightened abilities .

                         NAKIA
          It's what made T'Challa so strong .
         Ramonda stops in her tracks.

                         RAMONDA
          Nakia. I don't like this. The Herb
          belongs to us. We may be creating a
          bigger monster with M'Baku.

                         (BEAT)
          Nakia , you should take it yourself.

                         NAKIA
          I'm a spy with no army . I wouldn't
          stand a chance .

                         RAMONDA
          We'll go .
         They keep walking. Suddenly , they are surrounded by MEMBERS

          ,
         M'Baku stares down from his throne at Nakia, Ramonda and
         Shuri . He glowers at Ross for a long beat, unnerving
         everyone, before finally turning to Ramonda .

                         RAMONDA
          My son was murdered in ritual
          combat .

          94 .




                         M'BAKU
          Were the odds fair?

                         NAKIA
          Yes, but . . .

                         M'BAKU
          So, it was less a murder than a
          defeat?
         This irks Shuri.

                         SHURI
          Do not rub our noses in it --

                         M'BAKU
          Silence! I make the pronouncements
          here, girl .

                         ROSS
          Look uh, your highness, the new
          King is a --
         M'Baku drowns out Ross' voice with loud barks. The
         surrounding Jabari follow suit .

                         M'BAKU
          You cannot talk . One more word and
          I will feed you to my children .
         Ross looks petrified until M'Baku winks at Ramonda.

                         M'BAKU (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding. We are vegetarians .
         Stepping in , Nakia pulls out the HEART SHAPEDHERB.

                         NAKIA
          Great Gorilla M'Baku. This is why
          we are here. To offer this to you.
          An outsider s i ts on our throne.
          Only you can help us stop him .
         M'Baku considers . His ego stroked. But .. .

          Is he breathing?

          One of our fishermen found him at
          the edge of the river border. He
          brought him to me.

                         SHURI
          Why do you have him in the snow? !

                         M' BAKU
          It is the only thing keeping him
          from joining the ancestors .

                         SHURI
          We need to get him to my lab! I can
          heal him there .

                         M'BAKU
          Take him. He ' ll be dead in seconds.

                         RAMONDA
          Nakia , the Herb .
         Ramonda takes the herb from Nakia and pushes past M'Baku who
         looks on.

          T'Challa . Heal him . We must bury
          him .

         Resigned, Shuri and Nakia watch closely sitting down next to
         her as Ramonda performs the ritual on T'Challa, pouring the
         solution in his mouth, while praying in Xhosa , then scooping
         the snow atop his body .

          Our future depended on --

                         T'CHALLA
          You were wrong ! All of you were
          wrong ! To turn your backs on the
          rest of the world . We let the fear
          of our discovery stop us from doing
          what is right . No more! I cannot
          stay here with you. I cannot rest
          while he sits on the throne . He is

         Panther crashes to the bottom of the vibranium mine, wounded .
         Panther rolls over and barely dodges a knee drop from
         Killmonger .
         Killmonger and T'Challa exchange blows, Killmonger getting
         the better of T'Challa in his exposed areas, while T'Challa
         is getting nowhere. They both go for a super punch and knock
         each other back.
         T'Challa lands on his back and looks up at the sonic
         stabilizer . He radios to Shuri .

         In the vibranium mine , down the track from Panther and
         Killmonger's fight , we see a light come on in the train port .
         As they fight , the panels light up in succession, and we see
         a silent , Maglev train hurdling right at them .
         Both fighters evade the train at the last second as the train
         whips past , creating a barrier between them too big to jump
         over.
         T'Challa stands up as his suit partially retracts into his
         necklace leaving his skin exposed .
         Killmonger , on the other side of the train , looks at his
         malfunctioning suit in confusion . He turns and looks back at
         the stabilizer .

                         KILLMONGER
          I don't need a suit to kill you .
         They look at each other from across the blinding fast train .

                         KILLMONGER(CONT'D)
          Your reign is over. You sat up here
          safe and protected.

                         T'CHALLA
          You want to see us become just like
          the people you hate so much? Divide
          and conquer the land as they did?

                         KILLMONGER
          No I learn from my enemies -- beat
          them at their own game .

                         T'CHALLA
          You have become them . You will
          destroy the world, Wakanda
          included .

                         KILLMONGER
          The world took away everything away
          from me! Everything I ever loved !
          But I'm gonna make sure we're even.

          would even think about being loyal
          to you , and I'm gonna put they ass
          in the dirt , right next to Zuri.
         Hatred flashes over T'Challa's eyes as he reengages his mask
         and the train clears. Killmonger engages his mask , and they
         leap at each other again .

         their advanced shields to close them off into an impenetrable
         circle .
         Okoye looks around, searching for an option for escape
         through the sea of Border Tribesmen . We find W' Kabi in the

         the interior shield holding Border Tribesmen is suddenly
         lifted up by his collar , his shield disappearing as a result .

         we go around the horn to see the JABARI WARRIORS tearing
         through the border tribe perimeter with their wooden weapons.
         M'Baku , seeing the breaks in the interior shield calls for
         his troops to move forward .

         Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns
         and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large
         SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be
         demolished .

          119.




                         SHURI
          They are tearing it down. Good.

                         T'CHALLA
          They're not tearing it down . . . I
          bought this building.
         Shuri turns to him confused .

          T' CHALLA(CONT'D)
          And that building , and that one
          over there ... This will be the
          first Wakandan International
          Outreach Center .
         Shuri smiles at the surprise.

                         T'CHALLA (CONT'D)
          Nakia will oversee the social
          outreach ... And you will spearhead
          the science and information
          exchange .
         Shuri turns to T'Challa in shock at what this means.

                         SHURI
          You're kidding !
         T'Challa hits a button on his Kimoyo bead , and the RTF comes
         out of cloaking , revealing itself to have been parked behind
         the kids playing basketball .
         A YOUNG BLACKKID turns back to see the ship as the other
         kids collectively lose their shit .

                         OAKLAND KID #1
          What? ! Man what the hell is that?

                         OAKLANDKID #2
          That's like a Buggati space ship !

                         OAKLANDKID #3
          Woah, it came out of nowhere !!! Did
          y'all see that?

                         YOUNGBLACK KID
          What . ..



         They start to run up to the ship and touch it . Unsure at
         first .

          OAKLANDKID #1 (O.S.)
          We can take this back to the house
          y'all. ..

          120 .




          OAKLAND KID #2 (O. S.)
          We could pull up to school in this !

          OAKLAND KID #3 (O. S . )
          Hey look , we can break it apart and
          we can sell it!

         She starts off towards the kids, walking past the Young Black
         Kid.

          SHUR! ( 0. S . )
          Uhhh I wouldn't do that if I were
          you guys ...

          OAKLAND KID #1 (O.S . )
          Where you come from?

          SHUR! ( 0 . S . )
          From Wakanda .

          OAKLAND KID #1 (O. S . )
          What is a Wakanda?
         The Young Black Kid approaches T'Challa .

                         YOUNGBLACKKID
          Hey yo ! Is this yours?

          YOUNG BLACKKID (CONT'D)
          Who... who are you?
         T'Challa thinks on this and smiles .

          121 .



         INT . UNITED NATIONS ASSEMBLYBUILDING - DAY
         Several assembly members move around the room preparing for a
         meeting . Suddenly a hush falls over the hall as the Wakandans
         enter and walk up to the center pit.

                         T'CHALLA
          My name is King T'Challa , son of
          King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign
          ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and
          for the first time in our history
          we will be sharing our knowledge
          and resources with the outside
          world. Wakanda will no longer watch
          from the shadows . We cannot , we
          must not. We will work to be an
          example of how we as brothers and
          sisters on this Earth should treat
          each other . Now more than ever ,
          illusions of division threaten our
          very e x istence. We all know the
          truth : more connects us than
          separates us . In times of crisis ,
          the wise build bridges , while the
          foolish build barriers . We must
          find a way to look after one
          another, as if we were one single
          tribe .
         The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering
         what Wakanda could possibly have to offer .

                        A FRENCHAMBASSADOR
          can't help but lean into his microphone .

                         FRENCHAMBASSADOR
          With all due respect , King
          T'Challa , what can a nation of
          farmers offer to the rest of the
          world?
         There are a few chuckles from the gallery . Nakia , Okoye and
         Ayo share a look.
         T'Challa smiles .

         The kids race out of the hut and over to Shuri.

         Bucky exits the hut to the sight of a beautiful Wakandan
         lakeside. He takes it all in with a deep breath . Outside the
         hut are WAKANDAN SHAMAN (Man and Woman) and SHURI, embracing
         the three giggling CHILDREN TWODORAMILAJE observe Shuri

         Shuri smiles.

                         SHURI
          Come. Much more for you to learn.



         He follows Shuri towards the other huts.

 Captain America: The Winter Soldier


 [1991, a HYDRA base in a snowy landscape. A man enters a bunker and removes a red book marked with a black star.]
 [A technician raises a cylindrical chamber, revealing Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier.]
 [Bucky Barnes is secured in a chair, a mechanical device either side of his head causing him to howl in pain.]
 Vasily Karpov: [speaking Russian] Желание. Ржавый. Семнадцать. Рассвет. Печь. Девять. Добросердечный. Возвращение на родину. Один. Грузовой вагон.[1] ([subtitled] Longing. Rusted. Seventeen. Daybreak. Furnace. Nine. Benign. Homecoming. One. Freight car.) Доброе утро, Солдат. ([subtitled] Good morning, Soldier.)
 Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
 Vasily Karpov: У меня есть для тебя миссия. Санкционируй и Извлекай. Без свидетелей.([subtitled] I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract. No witnesses.)
 [Night. A car is driving down a dirt road alone. The Winter Soldier is waiting at the side of the road with his motorcycle. As the car passes, the Winter Soldier follows. He comes alongside the car and disables it. It slams into a tree. The Winter Soldier brings the motorcycle back around and climbs off. He walks to the car trunk and rips it open, revealing a silver case containing several blue packets - recreations of the Super-Soldier serum.]
 [Back at the HYDRA base]
 Vasily Karpov: Отлично, Солдат. ([subtitled] Well done, Soldier.)


 [Marvel Opening Credits]
 [Lagos, Nigeria, present day]
 [Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, adds sugar to a cup and stirs it. She looks around.]
 Steve Rogers: [on radio] All right, what do you see?
 Wanda Maximoff: Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It’s a good target.
 Steve Rogers: There’s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . .
 Wanda Maximoff: Cameras.
 Steve Rogers: Both cross streets are one way.
 Wanda Maximoff: So, compromised escape routes.
 Steve Rogers: Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?
 Wanda Maximoff: Yeah, the red one? It’s cute.
 Natasha Romanoff: [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.
 Wanda Maximoff: You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?
 Natasha Romanoff: Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.
 Sam Wilson: Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
 Natasha Romanoff: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?
 Steve Rogers: Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him.
 Sam Wilson: If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.
 [A garbage truck is pushing its way through traffic, with no regard to pedestrians or other vehicles]
 Steve Rogers: Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it.
 [From the back of Sam’s Falcon jet pack, a small drone, Redwing, launches and flies down to scan the garbage truck.]
 Sam Wilson: Give me X-ray.
 [Redwing weight analysis: Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]
 Sam Wilson: That truck’s loaded for max weight. And the driver’s armed.
 Natasha Romanoff: It’s a battering ram.
 Steve Rogers: Go now.
 Wanda Maximoff: What?
 Steve Rogers: He’s not hitting the police.
 INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES
 [A man is sitting in the guard station. He looks over as the garbage truck comes towards the gate. The driver jumps out, and the truck slams into the guard station. Two trucks rush into the compound through the newly-made hole.]
 [Soldiers in black armor emerge from the trucks, firing their rifles around the courtyard. Four soldiers fire gas canisters into the building. Soldiers wearing gas masks enter.]
 [Steve arrives and takes out several of the soldiers.]
 Steve Rogers: Body armor, AR-15's. I make 7 hostiles.
 [Sam flies in and up to a rooftop, spinning and using his wings to block gunfire. He takes out two soldiers.]
 Sam Wilson: I make 5.
 [Wanda arrives and flies over the rooftop and into the courtyard, blocking fire with her powers. She takes control of one soldier and lifts him upward.]
 Wanda Maximoff: Sam.
 [Sam glides down from the rooftop, catching the soldier on one of his wings.]
 Sam Wilson: Four.
 [Redwing flies by, scanning the inside of the building.]
 Sam Wilson: Rumlow’s on the third floor.
 Steve Rogers: Wanda, just like we practiced.
 Wanda Maximoff: What about the gas?
 Steve Rogers: Get it out.
 [Wanda uses her powers to lift Steve up and through the window. He grabs a soldier and pulls off their gas mask]
 [Rumlow is inside. He uses an attachment to his suit to punch down the door. He knocks aside a technician and enters a room with a vial labeled ""bio-hazard.""]
 Brock Rumlow: Pack it up.
 [In another area, Steve is behind a pillar, evading gunfire. He throws his shield, and it bounces off the soldier and back to Steve. Meanwhile, Wanda is now using her powers to remove the gas from the building. Sam is exchanging fire with several soldiers.]
 [Rumlow walks outside onto a balcony and sees the havoc Steve’s team has created.]
 Brock Rumlow: He’s here.
 [Inside the building, Steve sees the vial missing.]
 Steve Rogers: Rumlow has a biological weapon.
 [Natasha is riding in on a motorcycle.]
 Natasha Romanoff: (on radio) I’m on it.
 [She jumps off the motorcycle and it skids toward a soldier, taking him out. She runs forward, taking out soldiers through hand-to-hand combat and with her Widow's Bite cuffs. Rumlow comes up behind her and grabs her collar, dragging her onto a car. She fights back, and zaps his neck. No response.]
 Brock Rumlow: I don't work like that no more.
 [He throws her through the roof hatch into an armored vehicle, drops in a grenade, and shuts the hatch.]
 Brock Rumlow: Fire in the hole.
 Mercenary: No!
 [Natasha takes out the soldiers inside, then grabs one to shield herself from the grenade. The doors blow open and she is thrown out. She coughs, but is alive.]
 [Steve runs out onto the balcony and spots Rumlow aiming a mounted grenade launcher. The grenade slams into Steve's shield and he is thrown back inside. He scrambles to his feet as Rumlow fires two more times, throwing him out a window, onto a truck, and finally the ground. He struggles and gets him legs under him.]
 Steve Rogers: Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.
 [Inside the AFV, Rumlow secures the biological weapon and hands it to a soldier.]
 Brock Rumlow: Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.
 [The truck crashes into a nearby structure and Rumlow and the soldiers emerge.]
 Mercenary #1: Where are you going to meet us?
 Brock Rumlow: I’m not.
 [Sam lands on the roof of a structure. He scans the area with his goggles.]
 Sam Wilson: I got four, they're splitting up.
 [Natasha rides through the crowd, back on her motorcycle. She abandons it again and runs across the hoods of cars, in pursuit.]
 Natasha Romanoff: I got the two on the left.
 [Steve is also running across cars. He spots a vest in the middle of a crowd.]
 Steve Rogers: They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
 [Someone throws a bomb at Steve. It sticks on his shield. Steve throws it in the air and the bomb detonates safely away from citizens. Rumlow comes up behind Steve and punches him in the back.]
 Brock Rumlow: There you are, you son of a bitch. I’ve been waiting for this!
 [Meanwhile, Sam is still chasing the other mercenaries. Sam flies up and takes out his two, then searches their bags for the payload.]
 Sam Wilson: He doesn't have it. I’m empty.
 [Natasha is chasing the soldiers through the crowd.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Out of the way!
 [She tackles one soldier and engages him in combat. When the other soldier arrives, she hurls a basket at him to distract him. She uses her skills to fight them and ends up face-to-face with one soldier. They point their guns at each other. A moment passes. Then, the other soldier produces the vial.]
 Mercenary #1: Drop it. Or I’ll drop this. Drop it!
 Mercenary #2: He'll do it!
 [Redwing descends and fires at the soldier with the vial. He drops, and in the moment of distraction, Natasha fires at the other soldier, then catches the falling vial.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
 Sam Wilson: Don't thank me.
 Natasha Romanoff: I’m… not thanking that thing.
 Sam Wilson: His name is Redwing.
 Natasha Romanoff: I'm still not thanking it.
 Sam Wilson: He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
 [Steve and Rumlow are still fighting, neither one seeming to have the upper hand.]
 Brock Rumlow: Come on!
 [Rumlow pins Steve to a building and extends a blade from one of his gauntlets.]
 Brock Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face.
 [Steve grabs Rumlow's arm and pulls the gauntlet off, only for Rumlow to reveal another knife. But Steve bests him. Defeated, on his knees, Rumlow removes his mask, revealing a scarred face.]
 Brock Rumlow: I think I look pretty good, all things considered.
 Steve Rogers: Who's your buyer?
 Brock Rumlow: You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
 Steve Rogers: What did you say?
 Brock Rumlow: He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, ""Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go."" And you're coming with me.
 [He activates his bomb vest and Steve flinches as Rumlow's armor ignites, but Wanda keeps the blast contained around Rumlow who grimaces in agony. She lifts him into the air before she loses control, and the explosion finally blossoms, devastating entire floors of a nearby office building. Wanda sees what happened and covers her mouth in shock.]
 Steve Rogers: Oh my . . . [Steve stares up, open mouthed.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.


 [Soft piano is playing. Tony Stark's mother, Maria, sits at a piano. A young Tony is on the couch.]
 Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.
 Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?
 [Tony, wearing a Santa hat, staggers to his feet and chuckles.]
 Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
 Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
 Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?
 Young Tony Stark: Candice.
 [Howard pulls of Tony's hat.]
 Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
 Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
 Maria Stark: You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
 Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.
 Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
 [Maria stops playing the piano.]
 Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.
 [He walks out of the room, and Maria stands up.]
 Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.
 [Howard walks back in.]
 Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
 [Maria leans in to kiss Tony on the cheek, and when she leans back, an older Tony Stark is standing in the background. Howard and Maria walk out, leaving the two Tonys.]
 Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
 [He blows on a candle and everything around him shimmers, then starts to dissolve. It's a hologram.]
 Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
 [He is standing on a stage in front of a large crowd. A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors: Tony Stark.]
 Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? ""To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges."" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
 [The crowd chuckles.]
 Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
 [The crowd breaks out in applause and cheering.]
 Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
 [The teleprompter above the audience reads. 'Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation: Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]
 Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.
 [He exits the stage.]
 MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, ""Ooh, gross,"" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .
 [Tony is not listening.]
 Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?
 MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
 Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.
 Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
 MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.
 [Tony steps into a quiet corridor. He loiters by the men's room, then glances back at the stage door before walking towards the elevator. A woman in sober clothes is also waiting. Tony stops and turns his back to the wall.]
 Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.
 Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
 Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
 [He narrows his eyes and half smiles, then turns to face the elevator. He looks surprised to find the button unlit and pushes it himself.]
 Tony Stark: Are you going up?
 Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.
 [She digs in her handbag, Tony grabs her wrist. He realizes what he's done.]
 Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
 Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
 [She shoves a photo at him.]
 Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
 [Tony shakes his head.]
 Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.
 [She turns and walks away, leaving Tony standing by the elevator with a grim frown.]


 [At the Avengers Compound. Steve catches Wanda watching a news report on the Lagos attack and how they blame her for it.]
 News Anchor #1: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.
 King T'Chaka: Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.
 News Anchor #1: The Wakanda king went on to . . .
 [Steve, who was watching the news, turns his computer off, but sound drifts toward him from another room.]
 News anchor #2: They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.
 [Wanda is sitting on her bed, watching the news on her TV.]
 News Anchor #2 What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri -
 [The TV turns off. Steve sets the remote down and leans on the door frame.]
 Wanda Maximoff: It's my fault.
 Steve Rogers: That's not true.
 Wanda Maximoff: Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.
 Steve Rogers: I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.
 [He walks over.]
 Steve Rogers: Rumlow said ""Bucky"" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]
 Steve Rogers: And people died. It's on me.
 Wanda Maximoff: It's on both of us.
 Steve Rogers: This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.
 [Vision materializes through the wall. Wanda starts.]
 [Vision interrupts Wanda and Steve by walking through the wall into Wanda’s room]
 Wanda Maximoff: Vis! We talked about this.
 Vision: Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .
 [He gestures at the door and stops.]
 Vision: Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
 Steve Rogers: Thank you. We'll be right down.
 Vision: I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
 Steve Rogers: We know who it is?
 Vision: The Secretary of State.


 [The Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, is standing at the head of a table. Rhodey, Natasha, Steve, Tony, Sam, Vision, and Wanda are gathered around.]
 [The Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has summoned the Avengers to a meeting]
 Secretary Ross: Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word ""vigilantes"".
 Natasha Romanoff: And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?
 Secretary Ross: How about ""dangerous""? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?
 [Ross activates a screen behind him. News footage from past Avengers and SHIELD matters flash on the screen as he speaks.]
 Secretary Ross: New York.
 [A Chitauri leviathan. Terrified citizens. A soldier firing a gun. The Hulk smashes into a building and sends a dust cloud to engulf the camera.]
 [Rhodey looks regretful. He glances behind him at Natasha.]
 Secretary Ross: Washington DC.
 [The three Insight helicarriers, firing on each other. The destroyed Triskelion. A helicarrier crashing into the Potomac and throwing up a massive wave, engulfing citizens and the camera.]
 [Sam looks down.]
 Secretary Ross: Sokovia.
 [Terrified citizens, running. The city rising. A building falling over.]
 [Wanda stares at the screen, as does Tony.]
 Secretary Ross: Lagos.
 [The burning building. Paramedics moving a body. A dead girl.]
 [Wanda is particularly affected by the footage from Lagos. Steve sees this and intervenes.]
 Steve Rogers: Okay. That's enough.
 [Secretary Ross nods to an aide and the images disappear.]
 Secretary Ross: For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]
 [An aide hands him a thick book, which Ross slides across the table to Wanda. She picks it up, then slides it to Rhodey.]
 Secretary Ross: The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.
 Steve Rogers: The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.
 Secretary Ross: Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?
 [Steve looks up and meets Ross's eyes.]
 Secretary Ross: If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.
 James Rhodes: So, there are contingencies.
 Secretary Ross: Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.
 [Steve glances at Tony.]
 Secretary Ross: Talk it over.
 Natasha Romanoff: And if we come to a decision you don't like?
 Secretary Ross: Then you retire.
 [Natasha stifles a smile.]


 [Cleveland.]
 [Vasily Karpov sits, eating at the table in a cluttered house. He hears the sound of something crashing outside and peers through drawn blinds. Outside, Helmut Zemo stands by his car, the front end crumpled against Karpov's car.]
 Helmut Zemo: Hello? Is this your car out front?
 [Zemo comes to the door.]
 Helmut Zemo: I jumped the curb.
 [Karpov eyes his gun nearby.]
 Helmut Zemo: Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.
 Vasily Karpov: No. No cops.
 Helmut Zemo: Thank you.
 [Karpov slides a heavy duty lock and opens the door. Zemo punches him.]
 [Zemo is using a sledgehammer to smash a hole in the wall. He retrieves a large box from inside the hole and tips the contents onto a table. Karpov is hanging upside down, tied to pipes in his basement. There are various documents and the red book with the star on the cover. He holds the red book for a moment then opens a file. Inside is a photo of Karpov in his military uniform and beret.]
 Helmut Zemo: You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.
 [Karpov's head is in a sink, which is filling with water.]
 Helmut Zemo: ""Mission report: December 16, 1991.""
 Vasily Karpov: Who are you?
 Helmut Zemo: My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.
 Vasily Karpov: How did you find me?
 Helmut Zemo: When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.
 Vasily Karpov: What do you want?
 Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16. 1991.
 Vasily Karpov: Go . . . to . . . hell.
 [Zemo goes to lean on the sink as water continues to flow into it. He turns off the tap and studies Karpov's upside down face.]
 Helmut Zemo: HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.
 [Zemo stares at Karpov then nods resignedly. He turns the tap back on. The water is up to Karpov's eyes. Zemo watches the water level rise.]
 Vasily Karpov: Hail HYDRA.
 [Holding the red book Zemo walks away. Karpov twitches and struggles in his bindings.]


 [The Avengers are gathered at HQ. Steve is sitting, studying the Accords, while Rhodey and Sam argue behind him.]
 James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.
 Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
 James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, ""No, that's cool. We got it. ""
 Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?
 Vision: I have an equation.
 Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.
 Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.
 Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?
 Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
 James Rhodes: Boom.
 [Tony is lying on the couch, one hand over his face. When Natasha speaks, he removes the hand to look at her.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
 Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.
 Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.
 [He gets up and winces, rubbing the back of his head.]
 Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
 [He walks to the kitchen and grabs a mug.]
 Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
 [He puts his phone in a basket and taps it.The phone projects an image of a smiling young man. He looks down, then back up, and pretends to notice the picture for the first time.]
 Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
 [The others look affected by this .]
 Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]
 Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
 Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.
 Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?
 Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
 James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.
 Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.
 Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
 Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.
 Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
 Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.
 Vision: We would protect you.
 Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.
 [Tony looks at her, surprised.]
 Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -
 Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
 Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
 Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
 Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.
 Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
 [Steve's phone buzzes, and he pulls it out to check it. A text message reads: 'She's gone. In her sleep.']
 Steve Rogers: I have to go.
 [Steve gets up sharply, drops the Accords on the coffee table, and goes downstairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs, leans against the banister, and bows his head.]


 [London.]
 [A cathedral, packed with mourners. A choir is singing. Steve is one of six pallbearers carrying a coffin draped with the Union Jack. His eyes are red--he's been crying.]
 [At the altar, a candle burns by a framed photograph of Peggy Carter in a military uniform. The label reads ""Margaret 'Peggy' Carter"". The priest addresses the mourners.]
 Priest: And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.
 [Agent 13, Steve's ""neighbor"" from DC, steps up to the podium.]
 [Steve sits beside Sam in a pew at the front. Steve is looking down and doesn't see Sharon walk up. Sam is watching, and nudges Steve. He looks up to see Sharon, who glances at Steve and takes a breath.]
 Sharon Carter: Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
 [Steve realizes who exactly Sharon is, and takes a surprised breath.]
 Sharon Carter: She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.
 [She looks directly at Steve.]
 Sharon Carter: I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say "" No, you move.""


 [Later, Steve stands alone in the isle, still dressed in black. Natasha to him and he turns to her. He begins to speak without any introduction]
 Steve Rogers: When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.
 Natasha Romanoff: She had you back, too.
 Steve Rogers: Who else signed?
 Natasha Romanoff: Tony. Rhodey. Vision.
 Steve Rogers: Clint?
 Natasha Romanoff: Says he's retired.
 [She smiles slightly.]
 Steve Rogers: Wanda?
 Natasha Romanoff: TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.
 [Steve sighs and bows his head.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.
 [Natasha almost seems to be convincing herself.]
 Steve Rogers: What are we giving up to do it?
 [She sighs. He shakes his head, unconvinced.]
 Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.
 Natasha Romanoff: I know.
 Steve Rogers: Then what are you doing here?
 Natasha Romanoff: I didn't want you to be alone.
 [She pulls him in for a hug.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Come here.


 [Vienna.]
 [The United Nations, a modern complex of interestingly-shaped high rise buildings.]
 News Anchor #3: At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
 [T'Challa wears a sharp suit and stands, looking through a glass wall.]
 UN staffer: Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?
 Natasha Romanoff: Yes?
 UN staffer: These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.
 Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.
 T'Challa: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
 Natasha Romanoff: Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
 T'Challa: You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
 Natasha Romanoff: Well, I'm not.
 T'Challa: That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.
 Natasha Romanoff: Why? You don't approve of all this?
 T'Challa: The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.
 King T'Chaka: Unless you need to move a piano.
 T'Challa: Father.
 King T'Chaka: Son. Miss Romanoff.
 Natasha Romanoff: King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.
 King T'Chaka: Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
 Natasha Romanoff: Yes, so am I.
 Man on speakers: If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.
 T'Challa: That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
 Natasha Romanoff: Thank you. [Natasha goes.]
 King T'Chaka: For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.
 T'Challa: I'm happy, Father.
 King T'Chaka: Thank you.
 T'Challa: Thank you.
 King T'Chaka: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.
 T'Challa: EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
 [An enormous explosion goes off between two buildings and destroys the conference hall. T'Challa finds his father lying on the floor with his eyes closed. He grabs his father's wrist and feels for a pulse, but his father lies still. Devastated T'Challa lies across his father. He lifts him up and rocks him in his arms.]


 [A hotel.]
 Sharon Carter: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.
 Steve Rogers: Very practical.
 Sharon Carter: And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]
 Steve Rogers: CIA has you stationed over here now?
 Sharon Carter: In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.
 Steve Rogers: Right. Right. Sounds fun.
 Sharon Carter: I know, right?
 Steve Rogers: [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .
 Sharon Carter: You mean when I was doing my job.
 Steve Rogers: Did Peggy know?
 Sharon Carter: She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.
 Steve Rogers: Sure. [Sam comes over.]
 Sam Wilson: Steve. There's something you gotta see.
 News anchor #4: A bomb hidden in a news van . . .
 Sharon Carter: Who's coordinating?
 News anchor #4: . . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.
 Sharon Carter: Good. They're solid. Forensics?
 News anchor #4: More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.
 Sharon Carter: I have to go to work.


 [Fire crews hose down the buildings. A red and white medical chopper flies overhead.]
 Sharon Carter: Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]
 Natasha Romanoff: I'm very sorry.
 T'Challa: [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.
 Natasha Romanoff: That sounds very peaceful.
 T'Challa: My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.
 Natasha Romanoff: T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
 T'Challa: [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]
 [Steve phones Natasha. He's standing on the street in a cap and dark glasses.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Yeah?
 Steve Rogers: You alright?
 Natasha Romanoff: Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.
 Steve Rogers: Are you saying you'll arrest me?
 Natasha Romanoff: No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.
 Steve Rogers: If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.
 Natasha Romanoff: Why?
 Steve Rogers: Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]
 Natasha Romanoff: Shit.
 [Steve approaches Sam sitting at the counter of a coffee shop.]
 Sam Wilson: She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.
 Steve Rogers: He'd do it for me.
 Sam Wilson: 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]
 Sharon Carter: Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.
 Steve Rogers: Thank you.
 Sharon Carter: And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.


 [Zemo sits in a hotel room. He reads from Karpov's red book.]
 Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Один. Грузовой вагон… Грузовой вагон. Грузов- ([subtitled] Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.) [Knocking at the door. He puts the book in a drawer and goes to the door. He reaches for a gun tucked in the back of his trouser and cocks it.]
 German Innkeeper: Herr Müller, ich habe Ihr Frühstück. ([subtitled] Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]
 Helmut Zemo: Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)
 German Innkeeper: Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten. ([subtitled] Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)
 Helmut Zemo: Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ([subtitled] It's okay. This is wonderful.)
 German Innkeeper: Ich stell es dann mal hier hin… ([subtitled] I'll put this on your . . .)
 Helmut Zemo: Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ([subtitled] No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.) [Zemo closes the door. In the room is a large device with a cage at the bottom and a drum of coppered wire on top.]


 [Bucharest. Bucky is in civvies at a fruit store. He buys some plums!]
 Bucky Barnes: [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])
 [In a black cap and casual jacket Bucky walks along scanning around. Across the street he spots a twenty-something vender at a news-stand watching him. Bucky glances away, then looks back at the vender who's still watching him. The vender runs from his kiosk. Bucky goes over and picks up a paper. On the front page there are surveillance-photos of a man and the head line: 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]
 [In his dark blue, armored suit with his shield on his arm Steve is in a small apartment. He looks around, there's a mattress with disheveled covers and various bits of cheap looking furniture. The kitchen and bedroom are in the same room. Steve finds a notebook on top of the fridge. He picks it up and opens it. There are tabs of varying colors sticking out from amongst the pages.]
 Sam Wilson: [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.
 Steve Rogers: Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?
 Bucky Barnes: [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.
 Sam Wilson: They've set the perimeter.
 Steve Rogers: I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.
 Bucky Barnes: I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.
 Sam Wilson: They're entering the building.
 Steve Rogers: Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.
 Bucky Barnes: That's smart. Good strategy.
 Sam Wilson: They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
 [Armed cops run upstairs.]
 Steve Rogers: This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.
 [Outside the door a cop readies a battering ram.]
 Bucky Barnes: It always ends in a fight.
 Sam Wilson: 5 seconds.
 Steve Rogers: You pulled me from the river. Why?
 Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
 Sam Wilson: 3 seconds!
 Steve Rogers: Yes, you do.
 Sam Wilson: Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]
 GSG-9 Soldier: Schieß die Tür auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]
 Steve Rogers: Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.
 Bucky Barnes: [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.
 [Bucky grabs a backpack from under the floorboards and throws it out of the window. Bucky and Steve get behind Steve's shield to avoid gunfire. Bucky shoves Steve and he knocks a cop over. Bucky holds up his metal hand and repells bullets, then slams a cop into shelves. Bucky picks up a large cement brick and slams it into a cop. Steve fights a cop on the balcony. A cop shoots around the door outside. Bucky punches through the wall beside he door. He lays into the cops. A cop descends through a sky-light on a zip wire. Bucky grabs the cop's gun and slams him into the wall. Bucky bashes a couple of cops with the battering ram. More of the police team hurry up the stairwell. Bucky jumps on the zip-line-guy and swings down a level.]
 GSG-9 Soldier: Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am östlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)
 [Steve grabs the radio and crushes it. Steve jumps down a level as Bucky keeps punching the cops. Bucky tosses one of them over the railing and Steve catches him, stopping the cop from falling. He looks at Bucky wearily.]
 Steve Rogers: Come on, man.
 [Steve throws the cop up onto the landing. Bucky breaks a banister and swings down on it. Steve hurls a cop over his shoulders. Bucky lays into jet more cops and takes them out. A cop aims at Bucky and Steve knocks the gun from his hands with his shield which sticks in the wall. Bucky leaps down the stairwell and catches onto a railing. Steve pulls his shiel out of the wall. Bucky climbs up then runs along a corridor and leaps off a balcony. He tumbles onto the lower roof of the neighboring building where he finds where his backpack. he picks it up and runs.]
 [A muscular man clad entirely in black, Black Panther, slams into Bucky from behind, knocking him down. He has a full face mask with pointed ears. He extends his fingers and sharp claws pop out. He attacks Bucky with sweeping kicks and slashes. Bucky fights back but is kicked into a wall. Black Panther swipes his claws and spins gracefully. Bucky narrowly avoids being slashed, he holds up a metal bar to protect himself.]
 [Steve looks down at them as Falcon swoops from the sky.]
 Steve Rogers: Sam, southwest rooftop.
 Sam Wilson: Who the hell's the other guy?
 Steve Rogers: About to find out.
 [Steve leaps from the balcony down onto the neighboring building as a chopper flies up. Black Panther lunges at Bucky with his claws, but Bucky grabs his wrists. A soldier fires a machine gun from the chopper. The ammo bounces off Black Panther's armored suit.]
 Steve Rogers: Sam.
 Sam Wilson: Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]
 [Bucky breaks free from his attacker, slings his bag on his back, runs and jumps down a level. Black Panther slides down the wall using his claws for traction. Back lands at street level and the chase continues. Steve follows and lands rolling along the ground. Gunfire from the chopper tears up the sidewalk. Bucky jumps down through an opening and lands in an underpass, he runs through the traffic. Black Panther and Captain America drop down and chase after Bucky. A Special Forces Vehicle pursues them.]
 GSG-9 Driver: Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]
 [Bucky runs over the top of a speeding car, outpacing it. Black Panther is a few cars behind, keeping pace with Bucky. he leaps on the back of the 4x4 that Steve's driving. Steve swerves from side to side, trying to throw him off.]
 Steve Rogers: Sam, I can't shake this guy.
 Sam Wilson: Right behind you.
 [Several police cars join the chase. Steve side-swipes another car and drives on.]
 [Up ahead Bucky reaches a fork in the road and faces oncoming traffic. He leaps over a barrier. Steve drives through the barrier.]
 [A motorbike speeds towards Bucky. Bucky grabs the handlebar and spins the bike around in mid air, throwing the rider off. Bcuky gets on the bike and rides away sending cars careering out of the way. Steve keeps on Bucky's tail with Black Panther holding onto the back of the 4x4. They all rocket through another underpass. Sam flies into the underpass. Black Panther leaps off the front of the 4x4 onto Bucky's motorbike. Bucky flings him over his head and the bike leans down on its side. Bucky kicks his assailant away, straightens up and rides on. Black Panther catches a ride on Falcon's leg. Sam tries to kick Black Panther away. Bucky throws a sticky bomb and blows up the roof at the end of the underpass, bringing down tons of rubble. Black Panther leaps off from Falcon and throws Bucky off the motorbike. Steve swerves the 4x4 through the rubble, leaps out and pulls Black Panther away from Bucky. Steve stands, facing sleek and muscular Black Panther. Armed police arrive and surround them, guns aimed. War Machine leaps down from above and raises both hands.]
 James Rhodes: Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]
 GSG-9 Soldier: Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)
 James Rhodes: Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]


 [Avengers HQ. Vision follows a recipe.]
 Vision: 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]
 Wanda Maximoff: Is that paprikash?
 Vision: I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.
 Wanda Maximoff: [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted.
 Vision: In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .
 Wanda Maximoff: May I?
 Vision: Please. Wanda?
 Wanda Maximoff: Hmm.
 Vision: No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]
 Wanda Maximoff: Thanks.
 Vision: Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.
 Wanda Maximoff: Are you?
 Vision: My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]
 Wanda Maximoff: I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.
 Vision: [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.
 Wanda Maximoff: Are you afraid of it?
 Vision: I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.
 Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
 Vision: Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
 Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?
 Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.
 Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.
 Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.
 Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want?
 Vision: For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]


 [Berlin, day. Traffic rolls around the victory column. Police convoy drives beside the river Spree. Amidst the convoy is a gray armed truck. Inside Bucky wears restraints inside a prison pod. Three armed guards sit on the other side of the glass-walled pod. A police motorbike stops traffic and a van driver looks affronted. The convoy turns a corner onto a bridge across the river. In an SUV T'Challa sits in front of Steve who sits in front of Sam.]
 Sam Wilson: So, you like cats?
 Steve Rogers: Sam.
 Sam Wilson: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?
 Steve Rogers: Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?
 T'Challa: [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]


 [In a light gray walled bunker Bucky's pod is carried away by a forklift. Nearby Steve gets out of the SUV and glances across at Bucky who doesn't spot him. With Sam and T'Challa Steve approaches Sharon who's standing with a diminutive, gray-head man.]
 Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?
 Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
 Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.
 Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?
 Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.
 Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]
 [On a covered sky walk.]
 Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?
 T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.
 Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.
 Steve Rogers: He's alive.
 Tony Stark: [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
 Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.
 Tony Stark: [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
 Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?
 Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
 Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
 Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.
 Sam Wilson: That's cold.
 Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.
 [At a power station surrounded by trees the van with the driver who was affronted by the police convoy pulls up by the open gate. Scowling he puts the parking break on and picks up a clip board.]
 Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)
 [In a secured chamber a guard connects a pipe to Bucky's prison pod. The lights inside dim for a moment.]
 [Tony finds Steve in a glass-walled office overlooking the control room.]
 Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
 Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
 Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
 Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
 Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
 Steve Rogers: Pregnant?
 Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
 Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
 Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
 Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.
 Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
 Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.
 Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.
 Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
 Tony Stark: No, you don't.
 Steve Rogers: [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . .
 Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
 Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.
 Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
 Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?
 Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
 Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .
 Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
 Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
 Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.
 Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.
 Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
 Steve Rogers: She's a kid!
 Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
 Steve Rogers: [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]


 Helmut Zemo: [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?
 Sharon Carter: [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.
 Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.
 Sharon Carter: I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]
 Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.
 Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.
 [At the power station. The van driver honks and looks impatient watching the custodian's hut's front door.]
 Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)
 Custodian: Hier? (Here?)
 Delivery Truck Driver: Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]
 [At the UN-bunker Steve studies the blurry photograph of the man who bombed the congress in Vienna.]
 Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
 Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?
 Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.
 Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.
 Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.
 Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
 Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]
 Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.
 Helmut Zemo: [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
 Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.
 Helmut Zemo: You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one.
 [At the power station the custodian opens the crate. Finding Zemo's large device inside, he looks confused. The driver is at the back door of his van.]
 Custodian: Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)
 Delivery Truck Driver: Ich weiß es nicht. (I don't know.)
 [The device erupts. A bubble of energy engulfs the power station and sparks fly. In the city traffic lights fail. In the bunker the lights go out.]
 Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.
 Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
 Sharon Carter: [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]
 [In Bucky's pod.]
 Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?
 Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.] Желание. ([subtitled] Longing.)
 Bucky Barnes: [Bucky shuts his eyes.] No. [Bucky's head snaps back.]
 Helmut Zemo: Ржавый. ([subtitled] Rusted.)
 Bucky Barnes: Stop.
 Helmut Zemo: Семнадцать. ([subtitled] Seventeen.)
 Bucky Barnes: [Bucky's metal arm trembles in its restraint.] Stop. [He sneers angrily.]
 Helmut Zemo: Рассвет. ([subtitled] Daybreak.)
 [Bucky screams, clenches his fist and rips free of his restraints.]
 Helmut Zemo: Печь. ([subtitled] Furnace.) Девять. ([subtitled] Nine.)
 [Bucky thumps the inside of the pod.]
 Helmut Zemo: Добросердечный. ([subtitled] Benign.)
 [Bucky punches harder.]
 Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. ([subtitled] Homecoming.) Один. ([subtitled:] One.) Грузовой вагон. ([subtitled] Freight car.)
 [Bucky batteres the front of the pod with his metal fist and the glass screen flies clear. Zemo slowly rounds the pod with the book and the torch in hand. he stands before Bucky who straightens, a dark frown on his face.]
 Helmut Zemo: Солдат? ([subtitled] Soldier?)
 Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
 Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.


 [Steve and Sam arrive outside the chamber. Red emergency lights flash all around. There are many agents slumped on the floor. All of them out cold.]
 Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.
 Steve Rogers: [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?
 Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.
 [As Sam enters Bucky swings his fist which smashes through the wall as Sam ducks. Bucky grabs him by the jaw and throws him at the open pod. Steve lurches into the fight and lands a punch which Bucky barely feels. Bucky kicks and punches Steve out of the chamber. A punch from Bucky goes through the elevator door. Steve blocks the next one but the power of Bucky's fist sends Steve tumbling into the darkened elevator shaft.]
 [In the chamber Sam comes around and spots Zemo looking down the elevator shaft.]
 Man on PA #1: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)
 Sam Wilson: Hey.
 [Zemo bolts, Sam rises. At the bottom of the shaft Steve pushes himself off the floor.]


 [In the control room.]
 Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.
 Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.
 Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
 Sharon Carter: Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]
 [Sam chases Zemo up a stair well.]
 [Steve starts to climb the elevator shaft.]
 [Bucky stalks through the building's ground floor. He batters two guards. With tech-glasses on Tony takes cover behind a pillar.]
 Natasha Romanoff: [on radio:] We're in position.
 [Tony taps a wrist-control which becomes his Iron Man-glove. He zaps Bucky with a stun-burst before Bucky can shoot a guard. Tony rushes him, firing again. Bucky ducks the blast then trades blows with Tony, firing the gun. Tony has the Iron Man-glove over the barrel, blocking the bullet. He pulls the gun barrel loose then Bucky smacks him backwards. Sharon rushes Bucky, then Natasha rushes Bucky. They both land kicks and punches, then Bucky flips Sharon head over heels. She smashes onto a table then Natasha leaps on Bucky, legs around his neck. He slams her onto another table and grabs her throat.]
 Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.
 [T'Challa comes from nowhere and kicks Bucky off Natasha. He fights with Bucky, landing lightning fast kicks and some punches. Bucky gets a counter punch in and T'Challa falls, but quickly recovers. Bucky hurries up some stairs. T'Challa leaps the levels and vaults a railing, landing in front of Bucky. Limber T'Challa spin-kicks and grabs Bucky's metal arm which he tries to twist then looks worried as he realizes it isn't going to work. He throws Bucky backwards and keeps hold as they both tumble down the stairs. They resume fighting on the small landing and a leg sweep sends Bucky over the railing. T'Challa leaps down after him but finds the wide reception empty. He scans around.]


 [Outside staff flee the building en masse. Sam is among them and quickly spots something on the ground. He picks it up.]
 Sam Wilson: Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]
 [Bucky's on the rooftop helipad. He marches up to a blue chopper and pulls the lock off the door. he gets in the pilot seat. Steve rushes outside and sprints toward the rising chopper. He leaps and grabs the landing gear. Muscles bulging Steve pulls hard and the chopper struggles to gain height. Steve's feet kick for traction then he gets them flat on the helipad. The chopper drags him onto the weak looking mesh framing the helipad. Steve grabs the railing with one hand and clings to the landing gear with the other. He grits his teeth and his neck strains with the incredible effort. Bucky glowers from inside the chopper then throws the joystick left and the chopper's nose slams into the edge of the helipad. The rotor-blades are smashed to pieces and Steve ducks as the tail swings around. The chopper lies twisted on the mesh at the edge of the pad. Steve rises beside the canopy. Bucky's arm smashes through the glass and growling he grabs Steve's throat. The chopper starts to list over the edge. The tail breaks off and falls into the river below. Bucky keeps hold of Steve as the whole vehicle drops and slams into the river. The impact seems to knock Bucky out cold and he lets go of Steve. The body of the chopper sinks quickly to the riverbed along with other debris. Steve surfaces with Bucky in his arms.]


 [At an airport Zemo listens to a phone message.:]
 Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
 [Frowning Zemo ends the call. A TV news report is playing nearby:]
 News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ([subtitled:] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)
 [Zemo eyes the TV screen. He stands in line at a departures gate. The screen above the gate reads: 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']


 [In a huge abandoned warehouse Bucky comes to with his metallic left arm clamped in a huge industrial vice. Steve peers through a gap at a chopper flying overhead. Sam's over by Bucky.]
 Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]
 Bucky Barnes: Steve.
 Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?
 Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
 Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.
 Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?
 Bucky Barnes: What did I do?
 Steve Rogers: Enough.
 Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.
 Steve Rogers: Who was he?
 Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
 Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than ""I don't know.""
 Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
 Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?
 Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.


 [1991, at night Bucky rides alongside the car and somehow causes the car to crash. He circles back, pulls up and climbs off the motorbike. he's filmed on CCTV as he approaches the car's trunk. He janks it open, breaking the lock. Inside he opens a metal case which contains five clear drip bags filled with bright blue fluid.]
 [Four young men and a young woman sit up in hospital beds. The blue fluid is fed intravenously into their arms. The drip bags hang on stands beside them. They're all fit and muscular. One man, Josef, flexes a huge biceps. Josef is screaming, dragged into a cell and left on a bed.]
 Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts! [He struggles in leather bindings. A viewing slot is closed.]
 [Karpov is sitting at a desk in a corridor, making notes and listening. Karpov opens the door to a lab and switches on the light. Josef is sitting on a bed. He looks up at Karpov.]
 [Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.
 Vasily Karpov: Очень хорошо, Иосиф. ([subtitled] Good work.)
 [A medic takes Josef's pulse and Josef slams him onto the floor. A soldier clubs Josef onto the back with no effect. Karpov gets behind Bucky and aims a gun.]
 Vasily Karpov: Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда! ([subtitled] Get me out of here.)
 [Josef and the other four Winter Soldiers effortlessly dispatch a squad of Soldiers. Bucky escorts covering Karpov from the barred chamber, batting guards aside.]


 Steve Rogers: Who were they?
 Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
 Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?
 Bucky Barnes: Worse.
 Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?
 Bucky Barnes: Enough.
 Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
 Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.
 Sam Wilson: [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
 Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .
 Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.
 Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .
 Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
 Steve Rogers: We're on our own.
 Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.


 Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
 Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
 Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.
 Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
 Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
 Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
 Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?
 Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
 Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
 Tony Stark: Thank you, sir. [Tony rubs his hand on his chest and slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?
 Natasha Romanoff: [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?
 Tony Stark: Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez.
 Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.
 Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
 Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?
 Tony Stark: No.
 Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.
 Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?
 Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]


 [Queens, New York. Peter Parker walks out of an elevator holding a DVD-player and with a backpack on his shoulder. He walks into an apartment where his Aunt May is sitting on the couch with Tony Stark.]
 Peter Parker: Hey, May.
 May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
 Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]
 Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.
 Peter Parker: Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.
 Tony Stark: Tony.
 Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
 Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
 Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.
 Tony Stark: Right?
 Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .
 May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.
 Peter Parker: About the grant.
 Tony Stark: The September Foundation.
 Peter Parker: Right.
 Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?
 Peter Parker: Yeah.
 Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.
 May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
 Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?
 Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.
 Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.
 Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
 May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?
 Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
 Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.
 Tony Stark: Yeah?
 Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?
 Tony Stark: Yeah.
 Peter Parker: Yeah?
 Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.
 Peter Parker: Wow.
 Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
 May Parker: Sure.
 Tony Stark: [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
 Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.
 Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.
 Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.
 Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.
 Peter Parker: Okay.
 Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?
 Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?
 Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
 Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.
 Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
 Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?
 Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
 Peter Parker: Exactly.
 Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?
 Peter Parker: [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .
 Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
 Peter Parker: [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.
 Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.
 Peter Parker: It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!
 Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?
 Peter Parker: Nobody.
 Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
 Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.
 Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
 Peter Parker: I did.
 Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
 Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .
 Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?
 Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.
 Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
 Peter Parker: Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.
 Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
 Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.
 Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.
 Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.
 Tony Stark: [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
 Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
 Tony Stark: [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?
 Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.
 Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?
 Peter Parker: No.
 Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.
 Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!
 Tony Stark: Why?
 Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.
 Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
 Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
 Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
 Peter Parker: [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.
 Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this.
 Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .


 [Night, at Avengers' HQ. Vision floats above the floor. An explosion in the distance lights up the room for a moment. Vision and Wanda look out of the window.]
 Wanda Maximoff: What is it?
 Vision: Stay here, please.
 [Vision goes. Suddenly Wanda compels a knife across the room. It stops dead in front of Clint's head.]
 Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.
 Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?
 Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
 Vision: Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.
 Clint Barton: [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.
 Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.
 Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way.
 Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.
 Clint Barton: [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]
 Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.
 Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.
 Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.
 Vision: I can't let you.
 Wanda Maximoff: [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry.
 Vision: [He falters.] If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
 Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]
 Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.


 [Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre:]
 Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.
 Security Chief: [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved.
 T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .
 Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?
 T'Challa: My resources are considerable.
 Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.
 T'Challa: You know where they are.
 Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.


 [Under an overpass:]
 Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
 Steve Rogers: It's low profile.
 Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]
 Bucky Barnes: [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?
 Sam Wilson: No.
 Steve Rogers: I owe you again.
 Sharon Carter: Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
 Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.
 Sharon Carter: I know.
 [They kiss.]
 Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.
 Sharon Carter: That was . . .
 Steve Rogers: Late.
 Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.
 Steve Rogers: Okay.


 [On the 6th level of a parking garage at the Leipzig/Halle airport. Steve drives into the parking lot in the battered, old car. He parks by a grey van and gets out.]
 Clint Barton: Cap.
 Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
 Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.
 Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.
 Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.
 Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?
 Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good.
 Scott Lang: What timezone is this?
 Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.
 Scott Lang: [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.
 Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.
 Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!
 Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?
 Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .
 Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.
 Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?
 Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
 Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.
 Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?
 Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.
 Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.
 Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere müssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)
 Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.
 Sam Wilson: Stark.
 Scott Lang: Stark?
 Steve Rogers: Suit up.


 [Steve in his uniform strides through an underpass, then jogs onto a private runway, heading for a grounded chopper. An electro-disabler slams onto the chopper and Steve looks up. Iron Man and War Machine decent.]
 Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
 James Rhodes: Definitely weird.
 Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.
 T'Challa: [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.
 Steve Rogers: Your highness.
 Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
 Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.
 Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
 Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.
 Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
 Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid.
 Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.
 Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
 Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.
 Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
 Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.
 Tony Stark: . . . Good job.
 Steve Rogers: You've been busy.
 Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
 Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.
 Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on.
 Sam Wilson: [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.
 Steve Rogers: [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang.
 Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . .
 James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
 Scott Lang: [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America.
 Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
 James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.
 T'Challa: Barnes is mine!
 Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?
 Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
 Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!
 T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.
 Scott Lang: [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
 Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]
 Bucky Barnes: [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?
 Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.
 Peter Parker: [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]
 [Iron Man shoots rockets that explode just beyond Clint and Wanda.]
 [Steve fights hand to hand with T'Challa. War Machine locks on.]
 James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]
 Tony Stark: [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
 Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.
 Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
 Clint Barton: Hey, man.
 Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
 Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]
 Tony Stark: First time for everything.
 Clint Barton: Made you look.
 [Suddenly a car slams past Iron Man. He looks up as dozens more come crashing down. Wanda rows her glowing hands until Iron Man is buried under a pile of cars.]
 FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.
 Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.
 [Peter wings through the rafters in the terminal, chasing Sam who flies backwards firing shots. Peter stops on a high beam.]
 Peter Parker: Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?
 Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?
 Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
 Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
 Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, l'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!
 Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?
 Sam Wilson: I hate you.
 [Outside Steve kicks War Machine out of the air, then sends T'Challa reeling. War Machine's mace is broken.]
 James Rhodes: Great.
 Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]
 James Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]
 Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]
 James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.
 Natasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?
 Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
 Clint Barton: [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.
 Steve Rogers: Come on!


[Steve's team runs towards the Quinjet. A fizzing stream of energy slices across the runway and they stop. Vision hovers overhead.]
 Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]
 Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?
 Steve Rogers: We fight.
 Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]
 Peter Parker: They're not stopping.
 Tony Stark: Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]
 [Steve blocks a punch as Iron Man lands. Clint fires an arrow at Vision. War Machine flies after Falcon and Bucky trades blows with T'Challa. An explosive arrow hits Iron Man. Natasha throws Scott, as Peter swings through the air, struggling to evade vehicles projected by Wanda. Bucky lands punches on T'Challa, Clint and Natasha battle with batons. Clint pins her down with his bow.]
 Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?
 Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]
 Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]
 Bucky Barnes: [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.
 T'Challa: Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]
 [Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]
 Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
 Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
 Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]
 Sam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?
 Clint Barton: Buckled in?
 Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]
 Steve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?
 Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]
 Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?
 Peter Parker: Queens.
 Steve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]
 Tony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?
 FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.
 Tony Stark: They what?
 Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.
 Tony Stark: Who's speaking?
 Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
 Tony Stark: Friday?
 FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.
 Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]
 Bucky Barnes: [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
 Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
 Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
 Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.
 Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.
 Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?
 Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.
 Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.
 Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?
 Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?
 Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]
 Peter Parker: Holy shit!
 James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
 Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.
 Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!
 Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]
 Peter Parker: I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]
 [Scott kicks a bus towards T'Challa. Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past. Chasing Sam Iron Man evades Scott swinging the wing of a plane at him.]
 Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
 [Sam arrows towards Iron Man, firing Red Wing which cracks into Tony's helmet. Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]
 Scott Lang: You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]
 [Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]
 Clint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.
 T'Challa: I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]
 [Giant Ant-Man punches War Machine in the air and swings a gangway towards him as he recovers. War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]
 James Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]
 Scott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]
 Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.
 Steve Rogers: You know I can't.
 Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]
 Peter Parker: [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?
 James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
 Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
 Peter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]
 Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.
 James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.
 Peter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]
 Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?
 Tony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?
 Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!
 Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
 Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.
 Tony Stark: Yeah.
 Peter Parker: That was scary.
 Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?
 Peter Parker: What?
 Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.
 Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.
 Tony Stark: Stay down.
 Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!
 Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
 Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
 Natasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.


 Vision: [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.
 Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.
 Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.
 [Piloting the Quinjet, Steve looks over his shoulder and spots War Machine encroaching to the right. Steve pushes forward on the thrusters. Iron Man flies beside War Machine and Falcon follows them.]
 James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.
 [Vision takes aim and fires his head laser. Falcon spots it coming and tucks into a tumble. The laser overshoots and slices through the core on War Machines chest plate. War Machine loses power and goes into a spinning free fall.]
 Tony Stark: Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]
 James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]
 Tony Stark: RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals.
 FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
 Sam Wilson: [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]


 [Somewhere in Siberia, Zemo makes a phone call.]
 German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)
 Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)
 German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. Müller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)
 Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)
 [In his room in Berlin, Germany.]
 German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]


 [Steve flies the Quinjet towards mountains, Bucky sits behind him.]
 Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?
 Steve Rogers: [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.
 Bucky Barnes: [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
 Steve Rogers: [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
 Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.


 [At a hospital Rhodes lies inside an CT-scanner. He's in a blue gown covering his body. Tony paces up to Vision who watches Rhodes grave faced.]
 Tony Stark: How did this happen?
 Vision: I became distracted.
 Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.
 Vision: Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]
 [Tony and Natasha stand on a balcony looking towards a row of trees.]
 Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
 Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.
 Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.
 Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.
 Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
 Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
 Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
 Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]
 Tony Stark: [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?
 FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.
 Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.
 [Tony flies over a stormy sea in the chopper. He looks surveillance images on a tablet computer.]
 FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
 Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?
 FRIDAY: What do I look like?
 Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
 FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.
 Tony Stark: Must be.
 FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.
 Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?
 FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
 Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
 FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.


 [A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.
 Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: 'декабря 1991' (December 1991).
 Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]


 [Tony flies the shopper low over the broiling sea. He operates the chopper with a touch screen computer in a wall panel.]
 Guard: [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.
 [The sea swells and surges as Raft Prison rises up from beneath. A huge, fortified, circular structure with small lights around the sides. Two semi-circular doors open up in the flat circular top. The chopper lands on a helipad and the doors close above it. Tony, who's left arm is in a sling walks up to Secretary Ross.]
 Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
 Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]
 [Another security door opens. Tony walks into a chamber surrounded by large, bared windows. Beyond the windows are a number of prison cells. Tony takes in his surroundings.]
 Clint Barton: [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.
 Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
 Clint Barton: [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
 Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
 Clint Barton: Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.
 Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.
 Clint Barton: Yeah.
 Tony Stark: I didn't make you.
 Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .
 Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.
 Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la…
 Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]
 Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
 Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.
 Tony Stark: Who are you?
 Scott Lang: Come on, man.
 Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?
 Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?
 Sam Wilson: [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?
 Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
 Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.
 Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
 Secretary Ross: [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!
 Tony Stark: [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
 Sam Wilson: That's a first.
 Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
 Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.
 Tony Stark: Easy.
 [Tony walks to his chopper.]
 Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
 Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]
 [Sitting in the chopper Tony un-clips the sling holding his left arm. He cradles his arm in his hand for a moment. He slowly reaches out the injured arm and presses a button on a panel. The Iron Man Suit wraps itself around Tony, a hatch opens and he flies out of the chopper as Iron Man. He speeds through dark clouds. Close behind T'Challa is at the controls of a Quinjet.]


 [Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.
 On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.
 Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]
 Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
 Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
 Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
 Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?
 Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Doll.
 Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
 Steve Rogers: So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]
 [Now wearing his helmet Steve walks with Bucky up to the entrance set in rock. The door is still open.]
 Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.
 Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.
 [Steve leads them into the cast bunker. They travel down into the depths inside a caged elevator. it stops in the bowls of the bunker, doors slide open. Steve nods to Bucky and heaves up the cage door. Bucky readies his heavy duty machine gun and they walk along a corridor, keeping close to a wall. Bucky looks into an alcove full of junk then he and Steve move on up some stairs. At the sound of a loud thud they spin around, aiming down the corridor.]
 Steve Rogers: You ready?
 Bucky Barnes: Yeah.
 [Double doors part, forced open by Iron Man. Steve stares in surprise. Tony walks towards Steve and Bucky and retracts the suit's helmet.]
 Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.
 [Bucky keeps his gun up while Steve walks to meet Tony with his shield covering his body.]
 Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.
 Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
 Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?
 Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
 Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony.
 Tony Stark: You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]
 [the three of them cautiously walk along a corridor. T'Challa in his Black Panther Suit is hiding around a corner, watching them.]
 [With his helmet and face plate reengaged Iron Man leads Steve and Bucky towards the enormous chamber with the capsules standing in it.]
 Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.
 Steve Rogers: How many?
 Tony Stark: Uh, one.
 [As they enter the vast chamber the lights come on. Hazy, yellow mist descends within the capsules. As well as Josef, each one contains an enhanced soldier from the 1991 experiment. Steve and the others look around, bewildered.]
 Helmut Zemo: [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?
 Bucky Barnes: What the hell?
 Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
 Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.
 Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.
 Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]
 Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.
 Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
 Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
 Steve Rogers: [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?
 Helmut Zemo: [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
 Tony Stark: [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?


 [The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.
 Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.
 [The Winter Soldier walks over and hoists him up by his hair. He stares at Howard's bloody face. Howard stares back pleadingly.]
 Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?
 Maria Stark: Howard!
 [Tony glares at Bucky. In the video the Winter Soldier pounds Howard hard in the face with his metal fist.]
 Maria Stark: Howard!
 [In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.


 Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]
 Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.
 Tony Stark: [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?
 Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.
 Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
 Steve Rogers: Yes.
 [Tony steps back, his chin jutting upwards twitchy. Tony reengages the Iron Man helmet. He punches Steve to the floor and deflects gunfire from Bucky, disarming him. he grabs Bucky and flies across the chamber. He slams him onto the floor, then jumps on his arms. Steve's shield hits Iron Man, distracting him. Steve barges him backwards, Iron Man shoulders him to the floor and shackles his ankles. Bucky punches Iron Man who just lifts him and slams him against a machine. Iron Man raises a fist but Bucky twists it. A rocket shoots out of Iron Man's arm, a fireball explodes. Steve slices his shackles as a towering structure of pipework collapses. Tony and Bucky are thrown down a level as twisted metal falls around them, showering sparks.]
 Steve Rogers: [to Bucky] Get out of here!
 [As Bucky bolts Iron Man fires, but misses. Steve lands in front of him. Bucky hits a control panel and the silo-styled door overhead starts to open.]
 Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!
 Tony Stark: Move!
 Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!
 [Steve grabs Iron Man's ankle in mid air and smashes it. Iron Man blocks Steve by shooting down rubble, then falteringly flies up the tower.]
 FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
 Tony Stark: Ah crap.
 [Above him Bucky leaps from platform to platform. With stuttering jets Iron Man gives chase, then kicks Bucky and takes aim, but the energy bold rebounds off Steve's shield onto himself. Iron Man drops like a stone and lands on a lower platform.]
 Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.
 [As Iron Man soars upwards, Steve leaps and shoots a wire which wraps around Iron Man's neck and drags him back down. He deflects Steve's shield, then tries to target Bucky.]
 Tony Stark: Come on, come on.
 FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.
 Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?
 Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.
 [Bucky pushes them both from the walkway, Steve jumps into them to deflect their fall. Bucky lands on a platform while Tony and Steve land on the concrete floor besides opening in the wall where snow drifts in from outside]
 Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.
 Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.
 [They trade punches and Iron Man ends up pinning Steve down. Bucky picks up Captain America's shield and leaps down to help. As the two super soldiers fist fight with Iron Man the shield changes hands between them until Tony manages to zap Steve who is thrown back into the wall. Bucky struggles to hold Iron Man at bay as he unleashes an energy beam, then he forces Iron Man against the opposite wall and grips the glowing core in the chest of the Iron Man Suit. A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]


 [Zemo is outside, listening to a phone message.]
 Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
 T'Challa: [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.
 Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.
 T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
 Helmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, ""Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm."" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.
 T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
 Helmut Zemo: [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]
 T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.


 [Tony and Steve are still fighting in the silo.]
 FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.
 Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.
 FRIDAY: Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.
 Tony Stark: [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]
 Steve Rogers: He's my friend.
 Tony Stark: So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.
 Steve Rogers: [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day.
 [Iron man raises his left palm ready to fire. Bucky grabs his leg and Tony spins, kicking him in the face. Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit. When Steve struggles up again he takes hold of the shield, gripping the edge and pulling it free. He steps away from Tony who rolls painfully onto his side. Bucky lies bloodied but conscious, Steve reaches out and pulls him to his feet, holding him up as Tony looks on.]
 Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]


 [In a secure chamber at the Berlin UN bunker Zemo's contained in a prison pod, his ankles cuffed to his seat. Everett Ross enters the chamber.]
 Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?
 Helmut Zemo: [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?


 [Back at Avengers HQ, Tony is with Rhodes as he tentatively walks beside parallel bars with tech on his legs.]
 Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.
 James Rhodes: Yeah.
 Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
 James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]
 Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
 James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]
 Tony Stark: You okay?
 James Rhodes: Oh yeah.
 FedEx Driver Stan Lee: [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony ""Stank""?
 James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony ""Stank"". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. ""Stank"". Please, by the bathroom.


 [Tony is alone, opens the package and finds an envelope and a phone inside.]
 Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]
 FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
 Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.
 Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.
 Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.
 Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .
 Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.


 [Wakanda, medical facility.]
 Steve Rogers: You sure about this?
 Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]
 [Steve stands staring through a window, T'Challa walks towards him.]
 Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.
 T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…
 Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.
 T'Challa: Let them try.


 [In Peter's room on Queens. May speaks to him from somewhere in the apartment.]
 May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?
 Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]
 May Parker: What's ""some guy's"" name?
 Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.
 May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
 Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch.
 May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
 Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you.
 May Parker: Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]
 Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]
 [the final screen text shows 'Spider-Man will return']
 [End of Captain America: Civil War]

 Captain America: The Winter Soldier

[first lines; in the Arctic]
Search Team Leader: Are you the guys from Washington?
SHIELD Tech: You get many other visitors out here?
SHIELD Lieutenant: How long have you been on site?
Search Team Leader: Since this morning. A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.
SHIELD Lieutenant: How come nobody spotted it before?
Search Team Leader: It’s really not that surprising. This landscape’s changing all the time. You got any ideas what this thing is exactly?
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don’t know. It’s probably a weather balloon.
Search Team Leader: I don’t think so. You know we don’t have the equipment for a job like this.
SHIELD Tech: How long before we can start craning it out?
Search Team Leader: I don’t think you quite understand. You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane!
[as the shot widens we see a massive frozen ship revealed]
[after breaking into the metal aircraft]
SHIELD Lieutenant: [speaking into his comm] Base, we’re in. [looking around] What is this? [The technician nearly slipps on the ice covering the ground] Careful.
SHIELD Tech: [finding the frozen shield of Captain America] Lieutenant! What is it?
SHIELD Lieutenant: My God! [into his earpiece] Base, give me a line to the Colonel.
Voice from Earpiece: It’s 3 a.m., sir.
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don’t care what time it is. This one’s waited long enough.


[March 1942 Tønsberg, Norway]
[a villager, Jan, is running to a church]
Jan: [subtitled] They have come for it!
Tower Keeper: [subtitled] They have before.
Jan: [subtitled] Not like this.
Tower Keeper: [subtitled] Let them come. They will never find it.
[rumbling is heard and something breaks down the door, the stones killing Jan]
[the tower keeper closes Jan’s eyes and sees a machine moving away as HYDRA agents come in]
[a car drives up with the HYDRA symbol on the hood]
[HYDRA agents try to lift the lid of a coffin]
Hydra Lieutenant: Open it! Quickly, before he…
Johann Schmidt: It has taken me a long time to find this place. [to the Tower Keeper] You should be commended. [to one of his soldiers] Help him up.
[one of the soldiers helps the tower keeper to his feet]
Johann Schmidt: I think that you are man of great vision. And in this way we are much alike.
Tower Keeper: I am nothing like you.
Johann Schmidt: No, of course. But what others see as superstition, you and I know to be a science.
Tower Keeper: What you seek is just a legend.
Johann Schmidt: Then why make such an effort to conceal it? [opens an old tomb and picks up the glass cube from the skeletal remains of an old Viking] The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin’s treasure room. [he turns to face the tower keeper and deliberately drops and smashes the glass cube] It’s not something one buries. But I think it is close, yes?
Tower Keeper: I cannot help you.
Johann Schmidt: No. But maybe you can help your village. You must have some friends out there. Some… some little grandchildren perhaps. I have no need for them to die. [A big tank outside turns his guns towards the village threateningly.]
[referring to the carving of the tree on one of the tower walls]
Johann Schmidt: Yggdrasil. Tree of the world. Guardian of wisdom and fate, also. [he presses a button on the carving of the tree and it opens up to reveal the real cube] And the Führer digs for trinkets in the desert. You have never seen this, have you?
Tower Keeper: It’s not for the eyes of ordinary men.
Johann Schmidt: Exactly. [he closes the box containing the glowing cube and turns to his soldiers] Gove the order to open fire.
Hydra Lieutenant: Jawohl! (Yes!)
Tower Keeper: Fool! You cannot control the power you hold. You will burn!
Johann Schmidt: I already have. [He shoots and kills the tower keeper]


[In New York, at the enrollment facility.]
4F Doctor: [off-screen] O’Connel, Michael. Kaminsky, Henry.
Steve Rogers: Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.
4F Doctor: [off-screen] Rogers, Steven.
[Steve puts down the newspaper he is reading]
Enlistment Guy: It kind of makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?
Steve Rogers: Nope.
[as Steve is standing half naked in front of the doctor to examine him for enlistment]
4F Doctor: Rogers. What did your father die of?
Steve Rogers: Mustard gas. He was in the hundred and seventh infantry. I was hoping I could be assigned…
4F Doctor: Your mother?
Steve Rogers: She was a nurse in a TB ward. Got hit, couldn’t shake it. [the doctor looks at Steve’s file which shows he has a long list of health issues]
4F Doctor: Sorry, son.
Steve Rogers: Look, just give me a chance.
4F Doctor: You’d be ineligible on your asthma alone.
Steve Rogers: Is there anything you can do?
4F Doctor: I’m doing it. I’m saving your life. [He stamps the card 4F.]


[later, Steve is at the movie theater]
[a commercial about the war is playing before the movie]
Commercial Announcer: War continues to ravage Europe. But help is on the way. Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country. Even little Timmy is doing his part collecting scrap metal. Nice work, Timmy!
Loud Jerk: Who cares? Play the movie already!
Steve Rogers: [quietly] Hey, you wanna show some respect?
Commercial Announcer: Meanwhile, overseas, our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price freedom is never too high.
Loud Jerk: Let’s got! Get on with it! Hey, just start the cartoon!
Steve Roger: Hey buddy, you wanna shut up?!
[the guy gets up and looks at him]
Commercial Announcer: Together with Allied forces, we’ll face any threat, no matter the size.
[getting beaten in an alley by the loud jerk that was disturbing everyone at the cinema]
Loud Jerk: You just don’t know when to give up, do you?
Steve Rogers: I can do this all day. [and attacks the guy again]
James Barnes: Hey! Pick on someone your own size.
[after saving Steve from getting any further beatings by the loud jerk]
James Barnes: Sometimes, I think you like getting punched.
Steve Rogers: I had him on the ropes.
[picks up Steve’s enlistment form from the ground]
James Barnes: How many times is this?
[reading from the enlistment form]
James Barnes: Oh, you’re from Paramus now? You know it’s illegal to lie on the enlistment form. And seriously, Jersey?
Steve Rogers: You get your orders?
James Barnes: The one-o-seventh. Sergeant James Barnes. Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.
Steve Rogers: I should be going.
James Barnes: Come on, man. My last night! Gotta get you cleaned up.
Steve Rogers: Why? Where are we going?
James Barnes: The future.
[he hands him the newspaper he was holding, Steve opens it to see the ad for World Exposition Of Tomorrow, 1943]


James Barnes: I don’t see what the problem is. You’re about to be the last eligible man in New York. You know, there’s three and a half million women here.
Steve Rogers: Well, I’d settle for just one.
James Barnes: Good thing I took care of that.
[He waves to the dates, Connie and Bonnie, he’s lined up]
Connie: Hey, Bucky!
Steve Rogers: What did you tell her about me?
James Barnes: Only the good stuff.
[music starts playing]
Expo Announcer: Welcome to the Modern Marvels Paviliion and the World of Tomorrow. A greater world. A better world.
Connie: Oh, my God! It’s starting!
Mandy: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!
[Howard enters the stage and kisses the announcer]
Random Woman: I love you, Howard!
Howard Stark: [addressing the audience at the World Exposition fair] Ladies and gentlemen, what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile won’t even have to touch the ground at all.
[the female helpers take the wheels of the car on stage]
Howard Stark: Yes. Thanks, Mandy. [addressing the audience again] With Stark robotic reversion technology, you’ll be able to do just that.
[he turns on the switch of his machine and the car starts to hover off the ground]
James Barnes: Holy cow.
[the robots making the car hover suddenly malfunction and the car falls back on stage]
Howard Stark: I did say a few years, didn’t I?
[everyone laughs]
[Steve disappears, and Bucky notices]
James Barnes: Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls…
[at a recruitment center]
Woman: [to her male company, pulling him away from a mirror making him look like a soldier] Come on, soldier.
[Steve steps in front of the mirror but he’s too short to fill out the face]
James Barnes: Come on. You’re kind of missing the point of a double date. We’re taking the girls dancing.
Steve Rogers: You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
James Barnes: You’re really gonna do this again?
Steve Rogers: Well, it’s a fair. I’m gonna try my luck.
James Barnes: As who? Steve from Ohio? They’ll catch you. Or worse, they’ll actually take you.
Steve Rogers: Look, I know you don’t think I can do this.
James Barnes: This isn’t a back alley, Steve. It’s war!
Steve Rogers: I know it’s a war. You don’t have to tell me.
James Barnes: Why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs.
Steve Rogers: What am I gonna do? Collect scrap metal…
James Barnes: Yes!
Steve Rogers: …in my little red wagon.
James Barnes: Why not?
Steve Rogers: I’m not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.
James Barnes: I don’t…
Steve Rogers: Bucky, come on! There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That’s what you don’t understand. This isn’t about me.
James Barnes: Right. Cause you got nothing to prove.
Connie: Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?
James Barnes: [he turns to the girls] Yes, we are. [back to Steve] Don’t do anything stupid until I get back.
Steve Rogers: How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.
James Barnes: You’re a punk.
[he walks back towards Steve and hugs him goodbye]
Steve Rogers: Jerk. Be careful.
[as James is walking away]
Steve Rogers: Don’t win the war till I get there!
James Barnes: [He salutes then starts to walk away] Come on girls. They’re playing our song.
[Steve is in a medical examination room when a nurse whispers something inaudible to Young Doctor]
Young Doctor: Wait here.
Steve Rogers: Is there a problem?
Young Doctor: Just wait here. [walks out]
[Steve looks at a sign warning against lying on your enlistment form and starts to get ready to leave]
[An Enlistment Office MP walks in the room and Steve looks up at him worriedly]
[Dr. Abraham Erskine enters the room as Enlistment Office MP quietly leaves]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [to the MP] Thank you. [to Steve] So, you want to go overseas. Kill some Nazis.
Steve Rogers: Excuse me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Dr. Abraham Erskine. [walks over and introduces himself to Steve] I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.
Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.
[Dr. Erskine starts looking through Steve’s file]
Steve Rogers: Where are you from?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany. This troubles you?
Steve Rogers: [shakes his head] No.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [flipping through Steve’s file] Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities.
Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it’s not the exams I’m interested in. It’s the five tries. But you didn’t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?
Steve Rogers: Is this a test?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes.
Steve Rogers: I don’t wanna kill anyone. I don’t like bullies. I don’t care where they’re from.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? I can offer you a chance.
[They exit the room]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Only a chance.
Steve Rogers: I’ll take it.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [Dr. Erskine stamps Steve’s form and hands him back his file] Congratulations, soldier.
[Steve opens up the file and sees that he’s been stamped as accepted]


[In a HYDRA lab in a very mountainous region]
Johann Schmidt: Are you ready, Dr. Zola?
Dr. Arnim Zola: My machine requires the most delicate calibration. Forgive me if I seem overcautious.
Johann Schmidt: And are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for a transference?
Dr. Arnim Zola: With this artifact, I am certain of nothing. I fear it may not work at all.
[Schmidt inserts the Tesseract carefully into the machine. Zola starts it up.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Twenty percent. Forty. Sixty. Stabilising at 70%.
Johann Schmidt: [takes over the controls] I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor. [He turns the controls up to maximum and blue light flitters through the room.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is that?
[after successfully collecting the power from the glowing Tesseract using Zola’s machine]
Johann Schmidt: I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint. Though they may require some slight reinforcement.
Dr. Arnim Zola: The exchange is stable. Amazing! The energy we have just collected could power my design, all my designs. This will change the war.
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola, this will change the world.


[At a US training camp. Steve stands in line with others.]
Officer: [off-screen to other soldiers training] Ready, exercise!
Peggy Carter: Recruits, attention! Gentlemen, I’m Agent Carter. I supervise all operations for this division.
Gilmore Hodge: What’s with the accent, Queen Victoria? Thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.
Peggy Carter: What’s your name, soldier?
Gilmore Hodge: Gilmore Hodge, your Majesty.
Peggy Carter: Step forward, Hodge.
[Hodge steps forward, smirking]
Peggy Carter: Put your right foot forward.
Gilmore Hodge: Mmm… We gonna wrassle? Cause I got a few moves I know you’ll like.
[suddenly Peggy punches him hard in the face]
[Col.Phillips drives up]
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter.
Peggy Carter: Colonel Phillips.
Col. Chester Phillips: I see you’re breaking in the candidates. That’s good! [to Hodge] Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention 'til somebody comes tells you what to do.
Gilmore Hodge: [he gets back up] Yes, sir.
Col. Chester Phillips: [addressing the new army recruits] General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men… [he sees Rogers and continues talking] And because they’re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers. [While Phillips talk we see scenes of Steve unpacking and training where he fails to keep up and gets bullied by the others.]
Sergeant Duffy: Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!
Col. Chester Phillips: And they, will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.
[then we see Steve and some other trainees running up to a waiting Peggy and a flagpole]
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let’s go! Double time! Come on! Faster! Faster! Move! Move! [they arrive at the flag pole] Squad, halt! That flag means we’re only at the halfway point. First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter. Move, move!
Soldiers: Come on! Get up there!
Sergeant Duffy: [the soldier try to climb up the pole to no avail] If that’s all you got, this army’s in trouble! Get up there, Hodge! Come on! Get up there! Nobody’s got that flag in 17 years! Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in! Let’s go! Get back into formation! Rogers! I said fall in! [Steve pulls a pin out at the bottom of the pole causing it to fall over.]
Steve Rogers: [as he gives the flag to Sergeant Duffy] Thank you, sir. [He climbs into the car and they drive away.]
[The soldiers are doing push-ups.]
Peggy Carter: Faster, ladies! Come on. My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul. Move it!
Col. Chester Phillips: [walking besides Erskine] You’re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.
Col. Chester Phillips: When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he’ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him. [referring to Steve]
Peggy Carter: [as Phillips and Erskine arrive she commands the soldiers:] Up.
Col. Chester Phillips: You stick a needle in that kids arm and it’s gonna go right through him. [watching Steve struggling whilst training with the other new recruits]
Peggy Carter: Come on, girls.
Col. Chester Phillips: Look at that. He’s making me cry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.
Col. Chester Phillips: Do you know how long it took to set up this project?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, I know.
Col. Chester Phillips: All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What’s-His-Name’s committees?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.
Col. Chester Phillips: Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, he obeys orders. He’s a soldier.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: He’s a bully.
Col. Chester Phillips: You don’t win wars with niceness, doctor. [he takes a hand grenade] You win war with guts. [he throws the grenade at where the new recruits are training] Grenade!
[all the soldiers move away quickly but Steve jumps on top of it covering it with his body]
Steve Rogers: Get away! Get back! [waits for the grenade to go off but nothing happens]
Officer: It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.
[Steve looks at Phillips and Erskine]
Steve Rogers: Is this is a test?
[Erskine looks at Phillips as to confirm his point about choosing Steve]
Col. Chester Phillips: He’s still skinny.


[later that night, Steve sits on his bunk reading. Erskine knocks on the door.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: May I?
Steve Rogers: Yeah.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Can’t sleep?
Steve Rogers: I got the jitters, I guess.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [laughs] Me, too.
Steve Rogers: Can I ask you a question?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Just one? [he sits down facing Steve]
Steve Rogers: Why me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the… [he waves his hand] And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, ""You."" He says, ""You will make us strong."" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.
[flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine’s formula and injects himself with it]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man.
Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.
Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [he pours 2 drinks] Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.
[Steve holds up his glass to toast]
Steve Rogers: To the little guys.
[just as Steve’s about to drink from his glass]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.
[he pours the contents of Steve’s glass into his own]
Steve Rogers: All right. We’ll drink it after.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! I don’t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!


[At the Hydra facility, in Schmidt’s lab.]
Johann Schmidt: [he turns off the light] Is there something in particular you need? [An artist is painting Schmidt’s portrait in oil.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: I understand you found him.
Johann Schmidt: See for yourself. [Zola steps over to the table to find several survaillance photos of Dr. Erskine.] You disapprove.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I just don’t see why you need concern yourself. I can’t imagine he will succeed. [looking nervously at Schmidt] Again.
Johann Schmidt: His serum is the Allies’ only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Shall I give the order?
Johann Schmidt: It has been given.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Good. [he turns to go]
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola. [he turns on the lights] What do you think?
Dr. Arnim Zola: A masterpiece. [the artist looks relieved with Zola’s assessment]


[Steve and Peggy whilst driving through Brooklyn]
Steve Rogers: I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.
Peggy Carter: Did you have something against running away?
Steve Rogers: You start running they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can’t say no forever, right?
Peggy Carter: I know a little of what that’s like. To have every door shut in your face.
Steve Rogers: I guess I just don’t why you’d wanna join the army if you’re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful… a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but…
Peggy Carter: You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?
Steve Rogers: This is the longers conversation I’ve had with one. Women aren’t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.
Peggy Carter: You must have danced?
Steve Rogers: Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn’t seem to matter that much. Figured I’d wait.
Peggy Carter: For what?
Steve Rogers: The right partner.
[They pull up by an antiques shop and get out of the car.]
Peggy Carter: This way.
Steve Rogers: What are we doing here?
Peggy Carter: Follow me. [They go inside.]
Antique Store Owner: Wonderful weather this morning isn’t it?
Peggy Carter: Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.
[Peggy leads Steve into the hidden lab to Dr. Erskine and his team in a big circular room filled with machinery and a pod in the middle.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good morning. [he shakes Steve’s hand and sombody takes a photograph] Please, not now. [The photographer walks away, Steve looks at the pod] Are you ready? [Steve nods.] Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.
[In the adjacent observation chamber filled with officials.]
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.
Senator Brandt: Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?
Col. Chester Phillips: We needed access to the city’s power grid. Of course, if you’d given me the generators I requisitioned…
Senator Brandt: A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel. [referring to his company] Oh, this is…
Heinz Kruger: Fred Clemson, State Department. [He shakes Phillips’ hand] If this project of yours comes through, we’d like to see it used for something other than headlines.
Senator Brandt: [looing down into the chamber at Steve] Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.
[In the chamber Steve has climbed into the pod and lain down.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Comfortable?
Steve Rogers: It’s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?
Howard Stark: Levels at 100%.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good.
Howard Stark: We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we’ll ever be.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Agent Carter? Don’t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?
Peggy Carter: Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. [He takes a microphone and taps it.] Do you hear me? is this on? [to the small group gathered to watch Steve being prepared to become a super-solider] Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.
Steve Rogers: [after preliminary injection] That wasn’t so bad.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: That was penicillin. [to the others] Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one. [The serum is injected into Steve] Now, Mr. Stark. [Stark lowers a leaver, the pod moves upright and encloses Steve inside.] [knocking on the capsule that they’ve locked Steven in for the procedure to change him] Steven, can you hear me?
Steve Rogers: It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [turns to Stark] We will proceed.
Howard Stark: [manages the controls] That’s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That’s 40 %.
SSR Doctor: Vital signs are normal.
Howard Stark: That’s 50 %. Sixty. Seventy.
[as Steve is screaming in pain as he is receiving the vita rays]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven!
Peggy Carter: Shut it down.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven! [he knocks on the pod]
Peggy Carter: Shut it down!
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark! Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!
Steve Rogers: No! Don’t! I can do this!
Howard Stark: Eighty. Ninety. That’s 100 %. [Everything overloads until the reactor closes itself down.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Mr. Stark? [Stark opens the pod]
[after being transformed into a super-soldier]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven. Steven.
Col. Chester Phillips: The son of a bitch did it. [as everyone poors out of the observation chamber Kruger leaves a small, metal object like a cigarett case behind.]
Steve Rogers: [As he stumbles out of the pod supported by Stark and Erskine] I did it.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, yeah. I think we did it.
Howard Stark: We actually did it.
Peggy Carter: How do you feel?
Steve Rogers: Taller.
Peggy Carter: You look taller.
Col. Chester Phillips: How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?
Senator Brandt: I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor. [He shakes hands with Erskine.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Thank you, sir.
[Kruger detonates the bomb in the observation room and uses the confusion to steal the last vial of the serum.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Stop him! [Kruger shoots him and flees with Peggy chasing after him]
[Steve kneels beside Erskine who points at Steve’s chest and dies.]
[Kruger shoots his way to a get-away-car but soon after he drives away, Peggy shoots the driver and the car crashes into a taxi so Kruger changes cars.]
Taxi Driver: What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy’s been shot!
[Kruger drives off in the taxi, straight towards Peggy. She shoots at him but he just ducks and keeps going. Steve shoves her out of the way.]
Peggy Carter. I had him!
Steve Rogers: Sorry! [he runs after the cab] [While chasing the car he loses control over his new power and crashes into a bridalwear store.] I’m sorry. [he runs out into a street full of cars] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Steve catches up to Kruger’s car a the pier and causes him to lose control. Kruger gets out of the car and takes a young boy hostage.]
Mother: No! No! Not my son!
Young Boy: Stop it!
Mother: Don’t hurt him!
Heinz Kruger: Get back! [Kruger with the boy dangling in his arms runs away.]
Young Boy: Let me go!
Mother: Let go of my son! Don’t hurt him!
Steve Rogers: [as Kruger points a gun at the boy’s head.] Wait, don’t! Don’t! [Kruger points the gun at Steve and pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty. So instead he throws the boy into the water.] No! Don’t! [Kruger runs, Steve looks down at the boy.]
Young Boy: Go get him! I can swim!
[Kruger tries to escape in a submarine, but Steve jumps into the water, breaks the window an pulls Kruger out back onto dry land. As they struggle further the vial breaks.]
Steve Rogers: Who the hell are you?
Heinz Kruger: The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA! [he pops a fake tooth loose and swallows it, he starts to foam at the mouth and then die]


[At HYDRA HQ]
Hutter: The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.
Schneider: You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.
Johann Schmidt: Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.
Roeder: You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.
Schneider: The Führer feels… How does he put it? ""The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!""
Johann Schmidt: Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you. [They enter the lab.] Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.
Roeder: And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?
Johann Schmidt: Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.
Roeder: Your enemies?
Johann Schmidt: My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.
Schneider: Thank you, Schmidt.
Johann Schmidt: For what?
Schneider: For making it clear how obviously mad you are.
Hutter: [studying a map lying in Schmidt’s labor.] Berlin is on this map!
Johann Schmidt: So it is.
Hutter: You will be punished for your insolence! You will be brought before the Führer himself! [Schmidt kills them all with his new Tesseract-powered canon.]
Roeder: [screams before he’s desintegrated] Schmidt!!!
Johann Schmidt: My apolpgies, Doctor, but we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler’s shadow. Hail HYDRA.
HYDRA technicians: Hail HYDRA! [raising both arms to salute]
Dr. Arnim Zola: [when Schmidt turns to him] Hail HYDRA!


[At the SSR compound.]
Steve Rogers: [referring to the amount of blood samples taken from him] Think you got enough?
Peggy Carter: Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.
Steve Rogers: He deserved more than this.
Peggy Carter: If it could only work once, he’d be proud it was you.
[SSR tech lab with the Hydra submarine]
Senator Brandt: Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.
Col. Chester Phillips: Great. Why don’t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car? [to Stark who is working on the submarine] What have we got here?
Howard Stark: Speaking modestly, I’m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don’t know what’s inside this thing or how it works. We’re not even close to this technology.
Senator Brandt: Then who is?
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA. I’m sure you’ve been reading our briefings.
Senator Brandt: I’m on a number of committees, Colonel.
Peggy Carter: HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA’s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he’s invincible.
Senator Brandt: So what are you gonna do about it?
Col. Chester Phillips: Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.
Peggy Carter: Colonel?
Col. Chester Phillips: We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You’re flying to London tonight.
Steve Rogers: Sir, if you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.
Col. Chester Phillips: You’re an experiment. You’re going to Alamogordo.
Steve Rogers: The serum worked.
Col. Chester Phillips: I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.
Senator Brandt: [to Steve] With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I’ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country’s seen it. [to his aide] Paper.[the aide shows them the news paper (‘The New York Examiner’ Vol. XCVII No. 33.634, Wednesday, June 23, 1943), headlines: ""Nazis in New York - mystery man saves child""] The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don’t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?
Steve Rogers: Sir, that’s all I want.
Senator Brandt: Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.


Steve Rogers: [backstage as Steve is getting dressed in super-hero costume] I don’t know if I can do this.
Brandt’s Aide: Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi’s. Bing bang boom. You’re an American hero.
Steve Rogers: It’s just not how I pictured getting there.
Brandt’s Aide: The senator’s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you’ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield. [as Steve puts on his head mask he pushes Steve onto the stage]
USO Singer: Who’s strong and brave, here to save the American way?
Steve Rogers: [As women start to sing and dance in the background Steve reads:] Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there’s still a way all of us can fight.
USO Singer: Who vows to fight like a man, for what’s right, night and day?
Steve Rogers: Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.
USO Singer: Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.
[Steve leads a group of men dressed as soldiers in front of a moving image.]
Director: Cut. Guys, don’t look ath the camera.
[back to a scene where he’s on tour.]
USO Singer: We can’t ignore there’s a threat and a war we must win.
Steve Rogers: Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.
USO Singer: Who’ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who’ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who’s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.
Steve Rogers: We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can’t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That’s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love. [A men dressed as hitler sneaks up on him on the stage.]
Kids in USO Audience: Turn around! He’s right behind you!
Steve Rogers: Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us. [The man attacs him and gets fake-punched.]
USO Singer: Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who’ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who’s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we’re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it’s no one but Captain America. Who’ll finish what they began? Who’ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan! [Scenes show how Captain America goes on tour around America, appears in comics and films, how he’s approached by multiple fans, and generally becomes more liked and famous.]


[Italy, November 1943, 5 miles from the front. Steve addresses a crowd of soldiers dressed in his super-hero costume]
Steve Rogers: How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw? [silence from the crowd of soldiers] Okay. Uh… I need a volunteer.
Army Heckler#1: I already volunteered! How do you think I got here? [the crowd of soldiers laugh] Bring back the girls! [there’s a cheer from the soldiers]
Steve Rogers: I think they only know the one song. But um…let me…I’ll…I’ll see what I can do.
Army Heckler#1: You do that, sweetheart.
Army Heckler#2: Nice boots, Tinker Bell! [the crowd of soldiers laugh]
Steve Rogers: Come on, guys. We’re all on the same team here.
Army Heckler#3: Hey, Captain! Sign this! [he stands turns and pulls his pants down and the crowd starts to throw things at Steve.]
Army Heckler#4: Bring back the girls! [The women run on stage and the crowd cheers.]
Brandt’s Aide: [backstage to Steve] Don’t worry, pal. They’ll warm up to you. Don’t worry.


[Later, Steve sits on the edge of the stage sketching as rain pours down in the background.]
Peggy Carter: Hello, Steve.
Steve Rogers: [He turns and looks up at Peggy.] Hi.
Peggy Carter: Hi.
Steve Rogers: What are you doin’ here?
Peggy Carter: Officially I’m not here at all. That was quite a performance.
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Uh… I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I’m used to are usually more uh… twelve.
Peggy Carter: I understand you’re ""America’s New Hope""?
Steve Rogers: Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.
Peggy Carter: Is that Senator Brandt I hear?
Steve Rogers: At least he’s got me doin’ this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.
Peggy Carter: And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know? [Steve goes to respond but hesitates] What?
Steve Rogers: You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I’m wearing tights. [Honking in the background as an ambulance arrives with wounded soldiers. Steve and Peggy turn around to watch.] They look like they’ve been through hell.
Peggy Carter: These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.
Steve Rogers: The one-oh-seventh?
Peggy Carter: What?
Steve Rogers: Come on! [They run to a tent.] Colonel Phillips.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, if it isn’t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?
Steve Rogers: I need the casualty list from Azzano.
Col. Chester Phillips: You don’t get to give me orders, son.
Steve Rogers: I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.
Col. Chester Phillips: [pointing to Peggy] You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy.
Steve Rogers: Please tell me if he’s alive, sir. B-A-R…
Col. Chester Phillips: I can spell. [referring to Barnes] I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.
Steve Rogers: What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?
Col. Chester Phillips: Yeah! It’s called winning the war.
Steve Rogers: But if you know where they are, why not at least…?
Col. Chester Phillips: They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. But I don’t expect you to understand that, because you’re a chorus girl.
Steve Rogers: I think I understand just fine.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes. [as Phillips walks away Steve looks at the military map which shows where the men are]
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I do.
Col. Chester Phillips: [To Peggy] If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.
Peggy Carter: [She follows Steve to his tent where he starts to change and pack some things.] What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?
Steve Rogers: If that’s what it takes.
Peggy Carter: You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.
Steve Rogers: You don’t know that.
Peggy Carter: Even so, he’s devising a strategy. If he detects…
Steve Rogers: By the time he’s done that, it could be too late! [He walks out to a jeep.] You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?
Peggy Carter: Every word.
Steve Rogers: Then you gotta let me go. [He gets in the jeep.]
Peggy Carter: I can do more than that.
[backstage with the USO girls]
Brandt’s Aide: On stage, girls. Five minutes!
USO girl: Where’s my helmet?
Brandt’s Aide: Has anyone seen Rogers?


[Peggy and Steve in a plane piloted by Stark.]
Peggy Carter: The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It’s a factory of some kind.
Howard Stark: We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.
Steve Rogers: Just get me as close as you can. [referring to Stark and Peggy helping him] You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.
Peggy Carter: And you won’t?
Steve Rogers: Where I’m goin’, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot ‘em.
Peggy Carter: They will undoubtedly shoot back.
Steve Rogers: Well, let’s hope it’s good for somethin’. [He knocks at his shield.]
Howard Stark: Agent Carter, if we’re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue. [Peggy looks awkwardly at Steve who’s getting ready to parachute.]
Peggy Carter: Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen. He’s mad enough to brave this airspace, we’re lucky to have him.
Steve Rogers: So are you two…? Do you…? Fondue?
Peggy Carter: [She ignores Steve’s akward and confused rambling.] This is your transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.
Steve Rogers: Are you sure this thing works?
Howard Stark: It’s been tested more than you, pal. [as their plane is being attacked Steve goes towards the opened door of the plane to jump]
Peggy Carter: Get back here! We’re taking you all the way in.
Steve Rogers: As soon as I’m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!
Peggy Carter: You can’t give me orders!
Steve Rogers: The hell I can’t! I’m a Captain! [he looks at her and then jumps out of the plane]


[In the Hydra factory located in Italy, Schmidt and Zola walk side by side through the workspace.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.
Johann Schmidt: Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same.
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the prisoners, I’m not sure they have the strength.
Johann Schmidt: Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.
Dr. Arnim Zola: [To someone approaching him with a clip board] Not now!
[At the cells where prisoners are lead into. One of the guards knocks the hat from Dumdum Dugan’s head.]
Dum Dum Dugan: You know, Fritz, one of these days, I’m gonna have a stick of my own.
[Steve runs through the dark woods until he finds a road where trucks a driving by. He gets into the back of one of them and finds himself face to face with two Hydra guards.]
Steve Rogers: Fellas.
HYDRA guards: Ah!
[After Steve snuck into the HYDRA factory and stole a blue shining cartridge, he finds some of the captured American soldiers]
Gabe Jones: Who are you supposed to be?
Steve Rogers: I’m… Captain America.
James Montgomery Falsworth: I beg your pardon?
Dum Dum Dugan: [After Steve has unlocked their cells and prisoner start pooring out, he says to a Jim Morita, a Japanese looking man] What, are we taking everybody?
Jim Morita: [takes out his dog tags] I’m from Fresno, Ace.
Steve Rogers: Is there anybody else? I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.
James Montgomery Falsworth: There’s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one’s ever come back from it.
Steve Rogers: All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give ‘em hell. I’ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.
Gabe Jones: Wait! You know what you’re doin’?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.
[The prisoners escape into the compound, overpowering the guards with their sheer numbers. Dernier picks up one of the new Tesseract-powered HYDRA guns.]
Jim Morita: You know how to use that thing? [Dernier shoots, blowing up a wall] Okay.
[HYDRA factory command center]
Johann Schmidt: [stares at a surveillance screen] What is happening? [He presses an alarm.]
[back to the prisoners in the compound, Dum Dum and Jones overtake a small tank.]
Dum Dum Dugan: Hey. Not exactly a Buick.
Gabe Jones: [points at the controls] That one. Zündung. (Ignition.)
Dum Dum Dugan: Zündung?
James Montgomery Falsworth: [jumps into the tank] Get this thing going, Dugan!
Dum Dum Dugan: [to Jones] I didn’t know you spoke German.
Gabe Jones: Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.
Dum Dum Dugan: Didn’t ask for the resume.
[In the HYDRA control room Schmidt watches Steve on the monitors and decides to activate the self destruct sequence which are counting down from 7 minutes.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: No, no! What are you doing?
Johann Schmidt: Our forces are outmatched. [Zola looks at the screens, then runs out of the room.]
[Dernier and Morita running through the compound with other prisoners.]
Jim Morita: Keep moving! Grab those grenades!


[Schmidt secures the Tesseract while Zola packs the blueprints of his design. Steve sees him in the corridor but hesitates to chase him when he hears someone.]
James Barnes: Sergeant. 32557…
Steve Rogers: [he finds Barnes strapped to a chair in one of Schmidt’s testing labs] Bucky? Oh, my God. [he unstraps him from the chair]
James Barnes: Is that…
Steve Rogers: It’s me. It’s Steve.
James Barnes: Steve?
Steve Rogers: Come on.
James Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: I thought you were dead.
James Barnes: I thought you were smaller. [referring to Steve’s change of appearance]
Steve Rogers: Come on.
James Barnes: What happened to you?
Steve Rogers: I joined the Army. [referring to Steve’s undergoing change to a super-soldier]
James Barnes: Did it hurt?
Steve Rogers: A little.
James Barnes: Is it permanent?
Steve Rogers: So far.
[They flee through the exploding factory until they meet Schmidt and Zola.]
Johann Schmidt: Captain America! How exciting! I’m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive. [Steve punches Schmidt hard in the face]
Steve Rogers: You’ve got no idea.
Johann Schmidt: Haven’t I? [He goes to hit Steve but Steve protects himself with his shield. As they fight, Zola pulls a leaver and the catwalk they are standing on retracts to either side seperating them.] No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success! [he peels off the skin on his face to reveal that he is the Red Skull]
James Barnes: [to Steve referring to Schmidt’s skinless face] You don’t have one of those, do you?
Johann Schmidt: You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!
Steve Rogers: Then how come you’re running? [Schmidt and Zola continue their escape and so do Steve and Bucky.] Come on, let’s go. Up.
[Schmidt and Zola in an elevator.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sir? Are we going to the roof? [The doors open to reveal a one-man-plane] What about me? Where will I sit?
Johann Schmidt: [gives Zola his car keys] Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch. [We see Schmidt and Zola escaping.]
[Steve and Bucky on a catwalk, beneath them everything is on fire, they have to reach the other side of the room over a thin gantry.]
Steve Rogers: Let’s go. One at a time. [Bucky reaches the other side but the gantry collapses behind him.]
James Barnes: Gotta be a rope or something!
Steve Rogers: Just go! Get out of here!
James Barnes: No! Not without you! [Steve jumps over the chasm.]


[In the Amry camp Phillips is dictating a letter to a Corporal.]
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.
Peggy Carter: The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.
Col. Chester Phillips: Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
Corporal: Yes, sir. [he leaves]
Col. Chester Phillips: I can’t touch Stark. He’s rich and he’s the Army’s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.
Peggy Carter: With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I don’t think Captain Rogers did either.
Col. Chester Phillips: What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America’s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.
Peggy Carter: It wasn’t that. I had faith.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, I hope that’s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down. [Soldier start running and talking exitedly in the background.] What the hell’s going on out there? [They follow the crowd to the edge of the camp where Steve’S arriving with the freed prisoners.]
Man#1: Look who it is! [everyone cheers]
Steve Rogers: [salutes to Phillips] Some of theres men need medical attention.
Man#2: Medic, we got wounded.
Medic. Right over here.
Steve Rogers: I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.
Col. Chester Phillips: That won’t be necessary.
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir.
Col. Chester Phillips: [he turns and walks away from Steve and he notices Peggy] Faith, huh?
Peggy Carter: [to Steve] You’re late.
Steve Rogers: [holding up the broken transponder] Couldn’t call my ride.
James Barnes: [to the men] Hey! Let’s hear it for Captain America. [more cheering]


Senator Brandt: [somewhere in America talking to a small crowd] I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America! [he turns around but no one is there.] Captain America! [still nothing] Captain, that’s your cue! [his aide comes out, whispering something to him]
General: [sitting in the crowd talking quietly to the man next to him] I thought he’d be taller. [misunderstanding the aide to be Captain America]
[Allied HQ in London]
Steve Rogers: The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic. [he marks it on a map] And the sixth one was… about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line. [a soldier takes the map away] I just got a quick look.
Peggy Carter: Well, nobody’s perfect. [they walk over to Phillips and another map]
Steve Rogers: These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.
Peggy Carter: What about us?
Col. Chester Phillips: We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I’ll need a team.
Col. Chester Phillips: We’re already putting together the best men.
Steve Rogers: With all due respect, sir. So am I.
[in a bar]
Dum Dum Dugan: So, let’s get this straight.
Gabe Jones: We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?
Steve Rogers: Pretty much.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Sounds rather fun, actually.
Jim Morita: [belches] I’m in.
Gabe Jones: [Dernier and Gabe speaking French, Dernier laughs, they shake hands] We’re in.
Dum Dum Dugan: Hell, I’ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.
Steve Rogers: What’s that?
Dum Dum Dugan: Open a tab.
Jim Morita: Well, that was easy.
Steve Rogers: [Steve goes over to the bar.] Another round.
Barkeeper: Where are they putting all this stuff?


James Barnes: [Steve joins Bucky at the barcounter. In the background everyone's singing ""There's a Tavern in Town""[1]] See? I told you. They’re all idiots.
Steve Rogers: How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?
James Barnes: Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I’m following him. But you’re keeping the outfit, right?
Steve Rogers: You know what? It’s kind of growing on me.
Peggy Carter: [The singing in the bar stops as Peggy in a tight fitting, deep-red dress walks in.] Captain.
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter.
James Barnes: Ma’am.
Peggy Carter: Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?
Steve Rogers: Sounds good.
Peggy Carter: I see you top squad is prepping for duty.
James Barnes: You don’t like music?
Peggy Carter: I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.
James Barnes: Then what are we waiting for?
Peggy Carter. The right partner. 0800, Captain.
Steve Rogers: Yes, ma’m. I’ll be there.
James Barnes: [referring to the rejection he got from Peggy about going dancing with him] I’m invisible. I’m…I’m turning into you. It’s like some horrible dream.
Steve Rogers: Don’t take it so hard. Maybe she’s got a friend. [whilst waiting to see Stark]


Howard Stark: [Morning, by a glass chamber, Stark examines the Hydra cartridge] Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about. [He removes a glowing pellet. The blast sends Stark and his engineer flying across the room.] Write that down.
[Somewhere else in the building]
Steve Rogers: [to Private Lorraine] Excuse me. I’m looking for Mr. Stark.
Pvt. Lorraine: He’s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you’re welcome to wait. [Steve perches on the edge of a desk to wait] I read about what you did. [she holds up the newspaper showing his rescue mission]
Steve Rogers: Oh! The…yeah! Well, that’s you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.
Pvt. Lorraine: Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.
Steve Rogers: Really, it’s not a big deal.
Pvt. Lorraine: Tell that to their wives. [Steve gets nervous as she walks up to him]
Steve Rogers: Uh…I don’t think they were all married.
Pvt. Lorraine: You’re a hero.
Steve Rogers: Well, that…you know? That…that depends on the definition of it really. [she grabs hold of his tie]
Pvt. Lorraine: The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh…seeing as they’re not here. [drags him to the corner of the office and kisses him]
Peggy Carter: [she walks in] Captain! [Steve and Pvt. Lorraine separate] We’re ready for you. If you’re not otherwise occupied. [annoyed, she turns and walks ahead]
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter, wait.
Peggy Carter: Looks like finding a partner wasn’t that hard after all.
Steve Rogers: Peggy, that’s not what you thought it was.
Peggy Carter: I don’t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.
Steve Rogers: Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven’t been… fonduing?
Peggy Carter: [she turns to look at him] You still don’t know a bloody thing about women!
[In Stark’s lab]
Howard Stark: Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.
Steve Rogers: Really? I didn’t think…
Howard Stark: Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what’s goin’ on in a woman’s head, it’s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer. [referring to a piece of cloth lying on the table] Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra’s not going to attack you with a pocket knife. [referring to Steve’s Captain America shield] I hear you’re uh… kinda attached?
Steve Rogers: It’s handier than you might think.
Howard Stark: I took the liberty of coming up with some options. [shows him a few shields] This one’s fun. She’s been fitted with electrical relays. It’ll allow you to…
Steve Rogers: What about this one? [he picks up a round silver looking shield]
Howard Stark: No! No! That’s just a prototype.
Steve Rogers: What’s it made of?
Howard Stark: Vibranium. It’s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It’s completely vibration absorbent.
Steve Rogers: How come it’s not a standard issue?
Howard Stark: That’s the rarest metal on earth. What you’re holding there? That’s all we’ve got.
Peggy Carter: [as Steve is checking out the shield made out of Vibranium] You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I’m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.
Steve Rogers: [holds up the Vibranium shield against him] What do you think? [Peggy picks up gun and shoots it at Steve as he quickly holds up the shield to protect himself]
Peggy Carter: Yes. I think it works. [she puts the gun down and walks out of the lab, Steve and Howard looking at her stunned]
Steve Rogers: I had some ideas about the uniform. [gives Stark a piece of paper]
Howard Stark: [takes it] Whatever you want, pal.


[Montage of Captain America and his Howling Commandos fighting Hydra.]
[At the site of a destroyed Hydra base]
Johann Schmidt: You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!
Dr. Arnim Zola: This is hardly my area of expertise. I…I merely develop the weapons. I…I cannot fire them.
Johann Schmidt: Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.
Guard: [two guards arrive with the facility manager] Sir!
Facility Manager: I’m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.
Johann Schmidt: Evidently not. [kills him]


James Barnes: [On a snow covered mountain the Howling Commandos prepare to zipline onto the train.] Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I and I threw up?
James Barnes: This isn’t payback, is it?
Steve Rogers: Now why would I do that?
Gabe Jones: We were right. Dr. Zola’s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he’s going, they must need him bad.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Let’s get going, because they’re moving like the devil.
Steve Rogers: We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we’re bugs on a windshield.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Mind the gap.
Dum Dum Dugan: Better get moving, bugs!
Jacques Dernier: Maintenant! (Now!) [ Steve, Bucky and Gabe zippline onto the train.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: [watching Steve on a monitor, fighting his way through the train] Stop him! Fire again!
James Barnes: [after Steve helps him out] I had him on the ropes.
Steve Rogers: I know you did. [another trooper with a blaster appears] Get down!
Dr. Arnim Zola: Fire again! Kill him! Now!
Steve Rogers: [Bucky’s been blasted through a hole and is now hanging outside the train.] Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!


[Allied HQ in London, Phillips brings a tray of food to Zola after he’s been captured and imprisoned]
Col. Chester Phillips: Sit down.
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is this?
Col. Chester Phillips: Steak.
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is in it?
Col. Chester Phillips: Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?
Dr. Arnim Zola: I don’t eat meat.
Col. Chester Phillips: Why not?
Dr. Arnim Zola: It disagrees with me.
Col. Chester Phillips: How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we’ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here’s my brilliant theory. [Phillips starts eating the steak.] You wanna live.
Dr. Arnim Zola: You’re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.
Col. Chester Phillips: I bought you dinner. [passes him a piece of paper which Zola reads out loud]
Dr. Arnim Zola: ‘Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.’
Col. Chester Phillips: I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven’t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt will know this is a lie.
Col. Chester Phillips: He’s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You’re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers’ closest friend. So, I wouldn’t count on the very best of protection. There’s you or Schmidt. It’s just the hand you’ve been dealt.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods.
Col. Chester Phillips: Mmm.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Only the world itself will satisfy him.
Col. Chester Phillips: You do realize that’s nuts, don’t you?
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.
Col. Chester Phillips: And why is that?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Because he can do it!
Col. Chester Phillips: What’s his target?
Dr. Arnim Zola: His target… is everywhere.


[Hydra main base, Schmidt addresses his soldier]
Johann Schmidt: Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master of the world. Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie. Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail Hydra! [his soldiers all start saluting and shouting ‘Hail Hydra’]


[In London, a part of the city destroyed by bombs, formerly the bar where Steve enlisted the Howling Commandos. Peggy follows the voice of a radio through the rubble.]
Man on the Radio: Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area. Please wait for the all-clear. Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice. Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.
Steve Rogers: [when Peggy finds him he’s pouring himself some drink] Dr. Erskine said that… the serum wouldn’t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um…I can’t get drunk. Did you know that?
Peggy Carter: Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects. [referring to Barnes getting killed] It wasn’t your fault.
Steve Rogers: Did you read the reports?
Peggy Carter: Yes.
Steve Rogers: Then you know that’s not true.
Peggy Carter: You did everything you could. Did you believe in your friend? Did you respect him? [Steve looks at her as if to say yes] Then stop blaming yourself. Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.
Steve Rogers: I’m goin’ after Schmidt. I’m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.
Peggy Carter: You won’t be alone.


[The team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters]
Col. Chester Phillips: Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he’s a God. He’s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.
Howard Stark: Schmidt’s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour.
Gabe Jones: How much time we got?
Col. Chester Phillips: According to my new best friend, under twenty four hours.
Jaques Dernier: Where is he now?
Col. Chester Phillips: Hydra’s last base is here. [holding a photo he points to the base] In the Alps. Five hundred feet below the surface.
Jim Morita: So, what are we supposed to do. I mean, it’s not like we can just knock on the front door.
Steve Rogers: Why not? That’s exactly what we’re gonna do.


[after Steve has been captured by Hydra soldiers and brought to Schmidt’s weapon lab]
Johann Schmidt: Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone. But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?
Steve Rogers: He told me you were insane.
Johann Schmidt: Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?
Steve Rogers: Nothin’. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn. [after Schmidt has beaten him] I can do this all day.
Johann Schmidt: Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule. [Schmidt takes out his cube-energy pistol and points it at Steve]
Steve Rogers: So am I! [just then Steve’s team crashes through the windows of the weapons lab]
James Montgomery Falsworth: Rogers! You might need this! [He throws Steve his shield.]
Steve Rogers: Thanks! [Steve makes his way through the Hydra base which has fallen into chaos with the arrival of more Allied soldiers.]
Jim Morita: [into his comm] We’re in! Assault team, go!
Col. Chester Phillips: [standing outside listening to Morita] Move out! [the soldiers start running towards the Hydra base] Keep your spacing!


[In the Hydra base]
Hydra Soldier: Cutt off one head, two more shall… [he’s killed by Phillips]
Col. Chester Phillips: Let’s go find two more!
[As Steve chases Schmidt he is confronted by a Hydra soldier with flame throwers and saved by Peggy]
Steve Rogers: [after Peggy has killed the Hydra soldier] You’re late.
Peggy Carter: Weren’t you about to…
Steve Rogers: Right. [Steve continues his chase, but after Schmidt has boarded the Valkyrie Steve is not fast enough to catch the plane. Behin him Phillips and Peggy appear in a car and pick him up to chase the plane on the runway.] Keep it steady! [Just as Steve is about to leap from the roadster onto Schmidt’s plane Peggy stops him]
Peggy Carter: Wait! [she kisses him] Go get him. [Steve surprised by the kiss looks at Phillips]
Col. Chester Phillips: I’m not kissin’ you!


[Inside the Valkyrie there are multiple figher planes with their targets written on them: Boston, Chicago, New York. After Steve has managed to disable the fighter planes and their pilots he enters the cockpit where Schmidt is waiting.]
Johann Schmidt: You don’t give up, do you?
Steve Rogers: Nope! [They fight]
Johan Schmidt: You could have the power of the gods! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations! I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!
Steve Rogers: Not my future! [He flings his shield at Schmidt who is thrown into the cubic console.]
Johan Schmidt/Red Skull: What have you done? No. [he picks up the cube and energy starts to pour from it, revealing a window into space. A stream of blue energy engulfes Schmidt and takes him into the sky. The cube falls to the ground and burns through it until it falls into the sea below.]


[Steve takes over the plane’s controls, on a screen he reads ""Ziel New York City"" (target New York City), and tries the radio which is picked up by the Hydra control tower occupied by Peggy, Phillips and Morita.]
Steve Rogers: Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?
Jim Morita: Captain Rogers, what is your… [Peggy takes his place]
Peggy Carter: Steve, is that you? Are you alright?
Steve Rogers: Peggy! Schmidt’s dead.
Peggy Carter: What about the plane?
Steve Rogers: That’s a little bit tougher to explain.
Peggy Carter: Give me your coordinates, I’ll find you a safe landing site.
Steve Rogers: There’s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.
Peggy Carter: I’ll get Howard on the line, he’ll know what to do.
Steve Rogers: There’s not enough time. This thing’s moving too fast and it’s heading for New York. [referring to Schmidt’s plane, speaking through the plane’s control] I gotta put her in the water.
Peggy Carter: Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out.
Steve Rogers: Right now I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice. [as he’s forcing the plane down towards the water] Peggy?
Peggy Carter: I’m here.
Steve Rogers: I’m gonna need a rain check on that dance.
Peggy Carter: [with tears in her eyes] Alright. A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.
Steve Rogers: You got it.
Peggy Carter: Eight o’clock on the dot. Don’t you dare be late. Understood?
Steve Rogers: You know, I still don’t know how to dance.
Peggy Carter: I’ll show you how. Just be there.
Steve Rogers: We’ll have the band play somethin’ slow. I’d hate to step on your… [the line goes static and Peggy begins to cry]
Peggy Carter: Steve? Steve? Steve?
[Later, the world celebrates the victory over Nazi-Germany. The Howling Commandos are in a bar.]
James Montgomery Falsworth: To the Captain. [They drink]


[Stark on his search for the Valkyrie in the arctic sea on a ship. They’ve found the Tesseract.]
Stark’s Engineer: Sir? [Stark steps to him and watches on a screen how a submarine grabs the cube.]
Howard Stark: [to the captain] Take us to the next grid point.
Stark’s Engineer: But there’s not trace of wreckage. And the energy signature stops here.
Howard Stark: Just keep looking.


[After Steve has been missing for some time, we see him awaken in a 1940’s hospital and he can hear a baseball game on an old radio when a woman walks into the room]
Dodgers Announcer: [over the radio] Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow’s capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field. The Phillies have managed to tie up at 4-4. But the Dodgers have three men on. Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month. Wouldn’t the youngster like a hit here to return the favour? Pete leans in. Here’s the pitch. Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo. Three runs will score. Reiser heads to third. Durocher’s going to wave him in. Here comes the relay, but they won’t get him. [the door opens and an agent walks in]
SHIELD Agent: Good morning. [she checks her watch] Or should I say, afternoon?
Steve Rogers: Where am I?
SHIELD Agent: You’re in a recovery room in New York city.
Dodgers Announcer: The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers! Everyone is on their feet. What a game we have here today, folks. What a game indeed.
Steve Rogers: [he looks at her suspiciously] Where am I really?
SHIELD Agent: I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Steve Rogers: The game, it’s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there. [he gets up from the bed] Now, I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers… [she secretly pushes an alarm]
Steve Rogers: Who are you? [two soldiers in black uniform enter the room and Steve knocks them through the wall. Steve realizes that he’s on a some kind of made up set and he runs out of there.]
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers, wait! [into a comm] All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!
[Steve finds himself in 2011’s Time Square he looks around him in shock, numerous SUV’s encircle him and Fury steps out of one of the vehicles]
Nick Fury: At ease, soldier! Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there, but… we thought it best to break it to you slowly.
Steve Rogers: Break what?
Nick Fury: You’ve been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years. [Steve looks around him in shock] You gonna be okay?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Yeah. I just…I had a date.


[lines after end of credits; Steve’s is pummeling a punching bag in a gym and in anger knocks it off it’s chain, sending it flying across the room when Fury enters the gym]
Nick Fury: Trouble sleeping?
Steve Rogers: You’re here with a mission, sir?
Nick Fury: I am.
Steve Rogers: Trying to get me back in the world?
Nick Fury: Trying to save it.

(first lines; Sam Wilson is jogging around Washington, D.C. when Steve quickly catches up to him and runs past him.)
Steve Rogers: On your left.
(as Sam continues to jog Steve comes around again quickly after doing another lap.)
Steve Rogers: On your left.
Sam Wilson: Uh-huh, on my left. Got it.
(as Sam is still jogging Steve comes around again from behind him from another lap.)
Sam Wilson: Don't say it! Don't you say it!
Steve Rogers: On your left!
Sam Wilson: Come on!
(Sam gets angry and tries to catch up to him but only after a few seconds he's unable to carry and stops to rest.)
(as Sam is resting catching his breath sitting by a tree Steve walks over to him.)
Steve Rogers: Need a medic?
(Sam laughs.)
Sam Wilson: I need a new set of lungs. Dude, you just ran like 13 miles in 30 minutes.
Steve Rogers: I guess I got a late start.
Sam Wilson: Oh, really? You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take another lap.
(He hesitates for a moment before saying sarcastically.)
Sam Wilson: Did you just take it? I assumed you just took it.
Steve Rogers: What unit you with?
Sam Wilson: 58, Pararescue. But now I'm working down at the VA. Sam Wilson.
(Steve gives Sam a hand to rise.)
Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.
Sam Wilson: I kind of put that together. Must have freaked you out coming home after the whole defrosting thing.
Steve Rogers: It takes some getting used to. It's good to meet you, Sam.
(as Steve turns to leave.)
Sam Wilson: It's your bed, right?
Steve Rogers: What's that?
Sam Wilson: Your bed, it's too soft. When I was over there I'd sleep on the ground and use rock for pillows, like a caveman. Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...
Steve Rogers: Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.
(Sam smiles and nods his head.)
Steve Rogers: How long?
Sam Wilson: Two tours. You must miss the good old days, huh?
Steve Rogers: Well, things aren't so bad. Food's a lot better, we used to boil everything. No polio is good. Internet, so helpful. I've been reading that a lot trying to catch up.
Sam Wilson: Marvin Gaye, 1972, ""Trouble Man"" soundtrack. Everything you've missed jammed into one album.
Steve Rogers: I'll put it on the list.
(Steve gets his small notebook and pen out and notes it down on his list which also includes - in the American version of the movie - I Love Lucy (Television); Moon Landing; Berlin Wall (Up + Down) Steve Jobs (Apple); Disco; Thai Food; Star Wars/Trek (with Star Wars crossed out, indicating that he has seen it); Nirvana (Band); Rocky (Rocky II?)
(Steve gets a text message: ""Mission alert. Extraction imminent. Meet at the curb."")
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run. If that's what you wanna call running. (They shake hands.)
Sam Wilson: Oh, that's how it is?
Steve Rogers: Oh, that's how it is.
Sam Wilson: (He laughs.) Okay. Any time you wanna stop by the VA, make me look awesome in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know.
Steve Rogers: I'll keep it in mind.
Sam Wilson: Okay.
(Just then Natasha pulls up in her car by the curb and rolls down the window.)
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, fellas. Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil.
Steve Rogers: That's hilarious.
(Steve walks over to her car and gets in, Sam gives Natasha and her car an appreciative look.)
Sam Wilson: How you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: Hey.
Steve Rogers: Can't run everywhere.
Sam Wilson: No, you can't.
(He watches as Natasha quickly pulls away and drives off.)


(flying over the Indian Ocean the duo are with SHIELD agents, led by Brock Rumlow.)
Brock Rumlow: The target is a mobile satellite launch platform: The Lemurian Star. They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago.
Steve Rogers: Any demands?
Brock Rumlow: A billion and a half.
Steve Rogers: Why so steep?
Brock Rumlow: Because it SHIELD's.
Steve Rogers: So it's not off-course, it's trespassing.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm sure they have a good reason.
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm getting a little tired of being Fury's janitor.
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, it's not that complicated.
Steve Rogers: How many pirates?
Brock Rumlow: Twenty-five, top mercs, led by this guy. Georges Batroc.
(He shows them a photo of Batroc on the monitor.)
Brock Rumlow: Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had thirty-six kill missions. This guy's got a rep for maximum casualties.
Steve Rogers: Hostages?
Brock Rumlow: Uh...mostly techs. One officer, Jasper Sitwell.
(He pulls up Sitwell's photo on the monitor.)
Brock Rumlow: They're in the galley.

Steve Rogers: What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship? Alright, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you'll kill the engines and wait for instructions. Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get 'em out. Let's move.
Brock Rumlow: STRIKE, you heard the Cap. Gear up.
[as they are getting ready to dive off the jet; into his radio]
Steve Rogers: [talking into his wrist communicator] Secure channel seven.
Natasha Romanoff: Seven secure. Did you do anything fun Saturday night?
Steve Rogers: Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so... No, not really.
Pilot: [on radio] Coming up by the drop zone, Cap.
Natasha Romanoff: You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.
Steve Rogers: That's why I don't ask.
Natasha Romanoff: Too shy or too scared?
Steve Rogers: Too busy!
[Steve jumps out of the jet]
STRIKE Agent: Was he wearing a parachute?
[Rumlow smiles]
Brock Rumlow: No. No, he wasn't.


[after jumping out the jet Steve dives into the ocean and then climbs onto the ship, he then beats everyone on the deck swiftly before anyone raises the alarm when he's interrupted by one of the pirates pointing his gun at him]
French Pirate #1: Bouge pas! Bouge pas. (Don't move! Don't move.)
[he's shot dead by Rumlow as he parachutes down onto the deck behind Steve]
Steve Rogers: Thanks.
Brock Rumlow: Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me.
[Natasha and another agent parachute down onto the deck to join them]
Natasha Romanoff: What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you? She seems kind of nice.
Steve Rogers: Secure the engine room, then find me a date.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm multitasking.
[below deck we see the pirates are holding the ship's crew, including Sitwell, hostage]
French Pirate #1: J'ai dit à Batroc que si on veut que le SHIELD nous paye, commence à leur envoyer des corps maintenant ! ([subtitled] I said to Batroc, if we want SHIELD to pay, we have to start sending them bodies now!) [to the hostages]. Une balle pour quelqu'un ([subtitled] I have a bullet for someone). [shouting in English] You want a bullet in your head?! T'en veux une. Hein ! (Do you want one? Eh?) [he kicks one of the hostage's leg]. Bouge ton pied. Tu veux une balle dans la tête ? ([subtitled] Move that leg. Want a bullet in your head?)[meanwhile on the deck Steve moves quickly to find the hostages; in the control room]
Georges Batroc: J'aime pas attendre. Appelle Durand. Je veux que l'on s'arrache dès que la ranson arrive. ([subtitled] I do not like to wait. Call Durand. I want the ship ready to move when the ransom arrives.)
French Pirate: Oui, Batroc ([subtitled] Yes, Batroc.)
[he makes the call]
French Pirate: Durand. Démarre le moteur.([subtitled] Durand. Start the engine.)
Durand: Okay.
[Durand puts the phone down, turns and sees Natasha behind him]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, sailor.
[she quickly knocks him down and manages to swing down below deck shooting several of the pirates on the way]
[to one of the hostages]
French Pirate: Ferme ta gueule ! ([subtitled] Shut up.)
French Pirate #1: Bouge pas toi ! Mais qu'est ce qui se passe ! Tu veux jouer les héros, c'est ça ! T'as pas intérêt ! ([subtitled] What is it? Want to be a hero?)
[he looks at the hostages who keep their heads down]
French Pirate #1: Bon, j'ai trop attendu là. ([subtitled] Well, I've waited long enough.)
[he goes over to the locked door and bangs on it to get the attention of the pirate guarding outside]
French Pirate #1: Hé, trouve Batroc, si j'ai pas de nouvelles dans deux minutes, je commence à les tuer. ([subtitled] Hey, look for Batroc. If I do not hear anything in two minutes, I'll start to kill them!)
French Pirate #2: D'accord. Je vais le chercher ! ([subtitled] Okay. I'll find him!)
[as the pirate turns to leave Rumlow, who's standing behind him with a stun gun, shoots him, on the other side of the door the other pirate senses something but dismisses it]
 French Pirate #1: Deux minutes. ([subtitled] Two minutes.)
 [we see Rumlow and another STRIKE Agent places a bomb on the locked door]
 [in the control room]
 French Pirate: Silence radio du SHIELD, Batroc. ([subtitled] Radio silence from SHIELD, Batroc.)
 [Steve watches them from the deck, we see another STRIKE agent getting in position]
STRIKE Agent: Targets acquired.
[below deck Rumlow points his gun at the bomb placed against door where the hostages are being kept]
Brock Rumlow: STRIKE in position.
[into his radio]
Steve Rogers: Natasha, what's your status?
[we see Natasha jumping down below deck to knock out one of the pirates]
Steve Rogers: Status, Natasha?
Natasha Romanoff: Hang on!
[as the pirate attacks her she quickly knocks him out; into her radio]
Natasha Romanoff: Engine room secure.
French Pirate #1: Le temps est écoulé. Qui veut mourrir en premier. Hé toi ! Prend la fille. [subtitled] Time's up. Who wants to die first? [to one of his men] Hey, you! Take the girl. [into his radio]
Steve Rogers: On my mark. Three. Two. One.
[the STRIKE team start shooting at the pirates, blow open the door and Rumlow quickly kills the head pirate]
Jasper Sitwell: I told you, SHIELD doesn't negotiate.


[back in the control room one of Batroc's men tries to get hold of the pirate below deck]
French Pirate: Halo ? Je pense que la ligne est morte.J'ai perdu le contact. ([subtitled] Hello? Batroc, the line is dead. I lost contact with them.)
[just then Steve smashes in through the window using his shield but Batroc manages to escape; to Steve as he goes looking for Batroc]
Brock Rumlow: Hostages en route to extraction. Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap. Hostiles are still in play.
Steve Rogers: Natasha, Batroc's on the move. Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages.
[there's no reply from Natasha]
Steve Rogers: Natasha!
[suddenly Batroc attacks Steve, they fight on the deck of the ship, with Batroc getting quickly back up on his feet]
Georges Batroc: Je croyais que tu étais plus qu'un bouclier. ([subtitled:] I thought that you were more than just a shield.)
[Steve puts the shield on his back and takes off his mask]
Steve Rogers: On va voir. ([subtitled:] Let's see.)
[they start fighting again, Steve manages to finally knock Batroc down by smashing through into one of the rooms where Natasha is downloading something from the computer]
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is awkward.
Steve Rogers: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: Backing up the hard drive. It's a good habit to get into.
Steve Rogers: Rumlow needed your help. What the hell are you doing here?
[Steve goes over to Natasha and looks at what Natasha is backing up]
Steve Rogers: You're saving SHIELD Intel.
Natasha Romanoff: Whatever I can get my hands on.
Steve Rogers: Our mission is to rescue hostages.
Natasha Romanoff: No. That's your mission.
[she finishes backing up and pulls the flash drive out]
Natasha Romanoff: And you've done it beautifully.
[as Natasha goes to leave Steve grabs her arm]
Steve Rogers: You just jeopardized this whole operation.
Natasha Romanoff: I think that's overstating things.
[suddenly Batroc rises and throws a grenade at the two as he runs off, Steve deflects the bomb with his shield, grabs Natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes]
Natasha Romanoff: Okay. That one's on me.
Steve Rogers: You're damn right.
[Steve gets up and leaves in anger]


[The Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters; Steve walks into Fury's office]
Steve Rogers: You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?
Nick Fury: I didn't lie. Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.
Steve Rogers: Which you didn't feel obliged to share.
Nick Fury: I'm not obliged to do anything.
Steve Rogers: Those hostages could've died, Nick.
Nick Fury: I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.
Steve Rogers: Soldiers trust each other, that's what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around and shooting guns.
Nick Fury: The last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye. Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.
Steve Rogers: I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns.
Nick Fury: It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all.
Steve Rogers: Except you.
Nick Fury: You're wrong about me. I do share. I'm nice like that.
[Fury steps into an elevator with Steve following behind him]
Nick Fury: Insight bay.
SHIELD Computer: Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight.
Nick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
[the elevator starts moving down]
Steve Rogers: You know, they used to play music.
Nick Fury: Yeah. My grandfather operated one of these things for forty years. My granddad worked in a nice building, he got good tips. He'd walk home every night, roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He'd say ""hi"", people would say hi back. Time went on, neighborhood got rougher. He'd say ""Hi"", they'd say, ""Keep on steppin'."" Granddad got to grippin' that lunch bag a little tighter.
Steve Rogers: Did he ever get mugged?
Nick Fury: Every week some punk would say, ""What's in the bag?""
Steve Rogers: What did he do?
Nick Fury: He'd show 'em. Bunch of crumpled ones and loaded .22 Magnum.
[Fury smiles]
Nick Fury: Granddad loved people. But he didn't trust them very much.
[as they continue to ride down the elevator Steve notices the giant Helicarriers]
Nick Fury: Yeah, I know. They're a little bit bigger than a .22.
[as Fury shows Steve round]
Nick Fury: This is Project Insight. Three next generation Helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.
Steve Rogers: Launched from the Lemurian Star.
Nick Fury: Once we get them in the air they never need to come down. Continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines.
Steve Rogers: Stark?
Nick Fury: Well, he had a few suggestions once he got an up close look at our old turbines. These new long range precision guns can eliminate a thousand hostiles a minute. The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.
Steve Rogers: I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.
Nick Fury: We can't afford to wait that long.
Steve Rogers: Who's ""we""?
Nick Fury: After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis. For once we're way ahead of the curve.
Steve Rogers: By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection.
Nick Fury: You know, I read those SSR files. Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear.
Nick Fury: SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Don't hold your breath.
[Steve turns and walks off]


[Steve takes off on his motorcycle; in the Smithsonian Museum there is an exhibit dedicated to Captain America]
The Smithsonian Narrator: A symbol to the nation. A hero to the world. The story of Captain America is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.
[Steve, keeping his face hidden under a baseball cap, walks over to the exhibition]
Woman on PA: Welcome to the Smithsonian. Visitor information booths are available on the second level.
The Smithsonian Narrator: Denied enlistment due to poor health, Steven Rogers was chosen for a program unique in the annals of American warfare. One that would transform him into the world's first super soldier.
[a boy recognizes him, Steve smiles puts his finger against his mouth to indicate for the boy to keep quiet and the boy nods, Steve then watches an old footage of himself]
Old Footage Recording: In this rare footage, everyone's favorite warrior, Captain America...
[Steve goes to the display where there are mannequins with costumes of Steve's old commando squad]
The Smithsonian Narrator: Battle tested, Captain America and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes. Their mission, taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division.
[Steve walks over to the a display of his friend Bucky Barnes]
The Smithsonian Narrator: Best friends since childhood, Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in service of his country.
[Steve watches an older looking Peggy Carter being interviewed]
Peggy Carter: That was a difficult winter. A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line. Steve...Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over a thousand men, including the man who would...who would become my husband as it turned out. Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.
[Steve looks at the photo of Peggy he'd kept in his old compass]


[Steve visits Peggy, who is now lying sick in bed]
Steve Rogers: You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.
[Steve looks at Peggy's family photos by her bedside table showing her with her husband and children]
Peggy Carter: Mm. I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.
[Steve looks sad]
Peggy Carter: What is it?
Steve Rogers: For as long as I can remember I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I'm not quite sure what that is anymore. And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders, serve. It's just not the same.
[Peggy chuckles]
Peggy Carter: You're always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather...mucked it up.
Steve Rogers: You didn't. Knowing that you helped found SHIELD is half the reason I stay.
[Peggy takes Steve's hand]
Peggy Carter: Hey. The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.
[Peggy starts to cough, Steve turns to get her some water and goes to hand it to her]
Steve Rogers: Peggy.
[suddenly Peggy looks at Steve like she's seeing for the first time since he was frozen]
Peggy Carter: Steve?
Steve Rogers: Yeah.
Peggy Carter: You're alive! You...you came, you came back.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, Peggy.
[Peggy begins to cry]
Peggy Carter: It's been so long. So long.
Steve Rogers: Well, I couldn't leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.


[Fury is alone in his office; to his voice controlled computer]
Nick Fury: Secure office. [all the windows are blackened, Fury takes out the flash drive Natasha had downloaded all the files from the the Lemurian Star and places it in his computer] Open Lemurian Star's satellite launch file.
SHIELD Computer: Access denied.
Nick Fury: Run decryption.
SHIELD Computer: Decryption failed.
Nick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.
SHIELD Computer: Override denied. All files sealed.
Nick Fury: On whose authority?
SHIELD Computer: Fury, Nicholas J.
[Fury looks confused and worried]
Nick Fury: World Security Council.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.


[Alexander Pierce is holding a virtual meeting with the World Security Council]
Councilman Rockwell: If Nick Fury thinks he can get us costumed thugs and STRIKE commandos to mop-up his mess, he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.
Councilman Singh: Well, considering this attack took place one mile from my country's sovereign waters, it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.
Councilwoman Hawley: We don't need hearings, we need action. It's this Council's duty to oversee SHIELD.
Councilman Yen: A breach like this raises serious questions.
Councilman Rockwell: Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert SHIELD vessel in broad daylight?
Alexander Pierce: For the record, councilman, he's Algerian. I can draw a map if it'll help.
Councilman Rockwell: I appreciate your wits, Secretary Pierce. But this Council take things like international piracy fairly seriously.
Alexander Pierce: Really? I don't. I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet. If this Council is going to fold a rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field, maybe we need someone to oversee us.
Councilman Yen: Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...
[they are interrupted by Pierce's assistant walking in and whispering something to Pierce; to the council]
Alexander Pierce: Excuse me.
Councilman Rockwell: More trouble, Mr. Secretary?
Alexander Pierce: It depends on your definition.
[the meeting ends as Pierce leaves]
Alexander Pierce: I work forty floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?
Nick Fury: Well, a nuclear war would do it too.
[they shake hands; referring to Pierce's meeting with the World Security Council]
Nick Fury: Busy in there?
Alexander Pierce: Nothing some earmarks can't fix.
Nick Fury: I'm, uh...here to ask a favor. I want you to call for a vote. Project insight has to be delayed.
Alexander Pierce: Nick, that's not a favor, that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.
Nick Fury: It could be nothing, probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it's nothing.
Alexander Pierce: What if it's something?
Nick Fury: Then we'll both be damn glad those Helicarriers aren't in the air.
[Pierce hesitates a moment before replying]
Alexander Pierce: Fine. But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.
[Nick shakes his hand]
Nick Fury: Thank you, sir.
Alexander Pierce: And not just a flyby, he's got to mingle.
[Pierce turns and leaves]


[Steve goes to a PTSD group meeting where Sam is counseling other veterans]
Female War Veteran: The thing is I think it's getting worse. A cop pulled me over last week, he thought I was drunk. I swerved to miss a plastic bag. I thought it was an IED.
Sam Wilson: Some stuff you leave there, other stuff you bring back. It's our job to figure out how to carry it. Is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little man-purse? It's up to you.
[after the meeting ends Steve waits for Sam as he finishes saying goodbye to the veterans]
Female War Veteran: I'll see you next week.
Sam Wilson: Yeah.
Female War Veteran: Yeah. [Sam walks over to Steve]
Sam Wilson: Look who it is. The running man.
Steve Rogers: Caught the last few minutes. It's pretty intense.
Sam Wilson: Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems. Guilt, regret.
Steve Rogers: You lose someone?
Sam Wilson: My wingman, Riley. Flying a night mission.Standard PJ rescue op, nothing we hadn't done a thousand times before, till RPG knock Riley's dumb ass out of the sky. Nothing I could do. It's like I was up there just to watch.
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry.
Sam Wilson: After that, I had really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know?
Steve Rogers: But you're happy now, back in the world?
Sam Wilson: Hey, the number of people giving me orders is down to about zero. So, hell, yeah. You thinking about getting out?
Steve Rogers: No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.
Sam Wilson: Ultimate fighting? [Steve laughs] It's just a great idea off the top of my head. But seriously, you could do whatever you want to do. What makes you happy?
Steve Rogers: I don't know.


[as Fury drives through the city he instructs his car computer to make a call]
Fury's Car: Activating communications encryption protocol.
Nick Fury: Open secure line zero-four-zero-five.
Fury's Car: Confirmed.
Maria Hill: This is Hill.
Nick Fury: I need you here in D.C. Deep shadow conditions.
Maria Hill: Give me four hours.
Nick Fury: You have three, over. [Fury stops at a red traffic light, he looks over to the next car and sees the two police officers in the car look at him with suspicion] Want to see my lease? [the policemen quickly sound their police horn once before they start to drive off, as Fury goes to drive off suddenly another police car smashes into his car, his car is then surrounded by several other police cars crashing into him; inside his car Fury is injured]
Fury's Car: Fracture detected. Recommend anesthetic injection. [as Fury is giving himself the injection a SWAT team truck pulls up] D.C. Metro Police dispatch shows no units in this area. [Fury is surrounded by the police and SWAT team, he quickly realizes they are all disguised mercenaries; to his car computer]
Nick Fury: Get me out of here! [the mercenaries suddenly start shooting at Fury's car]
Fury's Car: Propulsion systems offline.
Nick Fury: Then reboot, dammit! [the armor on Fury's vehicle starts to become weaker, the mercenaries bring out a battering ram to break in]
Fury's Car: Warning! Window integrity compromised.
Nick Fury: You think? How long to propulsion?
Fury's Car: Calculating. [the mercenaries start to use the battering ram on Fury's car window] Window Integrity thiry-one percent. Deploying countermeasures.
Nick Fury: Hold that order! [the batterring ram is smashed against the car window again]
Fury's Car: Window Integrity nineteen percent. Offensive measures advised.
Nick Fury: Wait! [the battering ram is smashed against the window again]
Fury's Car: Window Integrity one percent.
Nick Fury: Now! [suddenly a minigun pulls up from inside the car and Fury uses it to return fire on the mercenaries causing the SWAT truck and some of the police cars to explode]
Fury's Car: Propulsion systems now online.
Nick Fury: Full acceleration, now! [as he continues to fire at the mercenaries Fury's car automatically backs up and drives off] Initiate vertical takeoff!
Fury's Car: Flight systems damaged.
Nick Fury: Then activate guidance cameras! [Fury goes over into the drivers seat] Give me the wheel! [Fury takes over driving his car as the mercenaries chase after him in their police cars] Get me Agent Hill.
Fury's Car: Communications array damaged.
Nick Fury: Well, what's not damaged?
Fury's Car: Air conditioning is fully operational. [the police cars continue to chase after Fury as he weaves through the cars on the road] Traffic ahead.
Nick Fury: Give me an alternate route.
Fury's Car: Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge. All vehicles stopped. 17th Avenue clear in three blocks, directly ahead. [as Fury heads into the traffic he smashes into some cars causing a pile up which stops the police cars, the mercenaries get out and start shooting at Fury's car, Fury manages to kill two of the mercenaries by running them down before getting past the traffic, but the remaining mercenaries continue to chase after him and manage to sandwich Fury's vehicle between them] Warning, approaching intersection. [as they approach the intersection Fury manages to shake off the two police cars, killing off the mercenaries]
Nick Fury: Get me off the grid!
Fury's Car: Calculating route to secure location. [Fury sees a mysterious figure emerge ahead which suddenly shoots a bomb that attaches itself to Fury's vehicle causing it to explode and flip over; trapped inside his car, Fury watches as the figure walks over to the car but he manages to escape just in time by using a laser weapon to burn a hole out.]


[As Steve is walking to his apartment his hears his pretty neighbor talking on the phone as she goes to do her laundry]
Sharon Carter: That's so sweet. That is so nice. Hey. I gotta go, though. Okay, bye. [turning to Steve] My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac. [Steve smiles at her] Yeah.
Steve Rogers: Hey, if you want...if you want, you're welcome to use my machine. Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.
Sharon Carter: Oh, yeah? What's it cost?
Steve Rogers: A cup of coffee?
Sharon Carter: Thank you, but um...I already have a load in downstairs, and, uh...you really don't want my scrubs in your machine. I'm just finished orientation in the infectious diseases ward, so.
Steve Rogers: Ah, well, I'll keep my distance.
Sharon Carter: Well hopefully not too far. [Steve nods and turns to go into his apartment] Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.
Steve Rogers: Oh. Right, thank you.
Sharon Carter: Yeah. [Steve watches her go down the stairs before turning in suspicion to his door]


[Steve hears music as he cautiously enters his apartment though the window, he grabs his shield for protection and finds Fury sitting on his couch in the dark]
Steve Rogers: I don't remember giving you a key.
Nick Fury: You really think I'd need one? My wife kicked me out.
Steve Rogers: Didn't know you were married.
Nick Fury: A lot of things you don't about me.
Steve Rogers: I know, Nick. That's the problem. [as Steve turns on the light he notices Fury's injuries for the first time, but Fury indicates for him to be silent, he turns off the light and writes something on his phone and shows it to Steve; ""ears everywhere""]
Nick Fury: I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash. [he writes another text and shows it to Steve; ""SHIELD compromised""]
Steve Rogers: Who else knows about your wife? [Fury shows him another text; ""You and me""]
Nick Fury: Just...my friends.
Steve Rogers: Is that what we are?
Nick Fury: That's up to you. [suddenly Fury is shot three times from through the wall and collapses, Steve looks out the window for the shooter then he quickly drags Fury to the next room, before he leaves Fury hands him the flash drive] Don't...trust anyone. [Fury passes out] [Steve hears someone breaking into his apartment and hears his neighbor calling out to him]
Sharon Carter: Captain Rogers? [Steve sees her walking in with her gun pointed] Captain, I'm Agent 13 of SHIELD Special Service.
Steve Rogers: Kate?
Sharon Carter: I'm assigned to protect you.
Steve Rogers: On whose order? [She notices Fury lying injured on the ground]
Sharon Carter: His. [she goes to Fury then contacts SHIELD through her radio] Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs.
SHIELD Agent: Do you have a twenty on the shooter? [Steve notices the shooter though the window]
Steve Rogers: Tell him I'm in pursuit. [Steve smashes through his window and runs after the assassin, who is the same mysterious man that had exploded Fury's car, Steve chases him through an office building smashing through the walls, when he finally catches up with him on the roof he throws his shield at the assassin, but he catches it with one swift move, then throws it back to Steve and then jumps down the building and disappears.]


[Natasha goes to the hospital and meets up with Steve, they watch doctors operating on Fury]
Natasha Romanoff: Is he gonna make it?
Steve Rogers: I don't know.
Natasha Romanoff: Tell me about the shooter.
Steve Rogers: He's fast and strong. Had a metal arm. [just then Agent Maria Hill also joins them]
Natasha Romanoff: Ballistics?
Maria Hill: Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.
Natasha Romanoff: Soviet-made.
Maria Hill: Yeah. [suddenly they watch in shock as Fury's state deteriorates]
Male Nurse: He's in V-tach.
Female Nurse: Crash cart coming in.
Doctor: Nurse, help me with the drape.
Male Nurse: BP is dropping.
Doctor: Defibrillator! [Steve, Natasha and Hill watch in shock as Fury is flatlining] I want you to charge him at one hundred.
Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick.
Doctor: Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given a shock with the defibrillator] Pulse?
Male Nurse: No pulse.
Doctor #1: No pulse.
Doctor: Okay. 200, please. Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given another shock] Give me epinephrine! Pulse?
Male Nurse: Negative.
Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick. Don't do this to me. [the three watch the doctors as they continue to revive Fury but Fury is still showing as flatlining, Steve turns away as they finally call his time of death]
Doctor: What's the time?
Female Nurse: 1:03, Doctor.
Doctor: Time of death, 1:03 a.m. [Steve looks down at the flash drive Fury had given him]


[Natasha and Steve are in a room where Fury's dead body has been laid out, Natasha is looking at Fury's body with tears running down her face, Hill joins them]
Maria Hill: I need to take him. [Steve goes over to Natasha]
Steve Rogers: Natasha. [she doesn't respond, instead she tenderly touches Fury's head then turns and walks out, Steve follows her] Natasha!
Natasha Romanoff: Why was Fury in your apartment?
Steve Rogers: I don't know. [they are interrupted by Rumlow]
Brock Rumlow: Cap, they want you back at SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, give me a second.
Brock Rumlow: They want you now.
Steve Rogers: Okay. [Steven turns to Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: You're a terrible liar. [she turns and walks off]
Jasper Sitwell: [on earpiece] STRIKE team, escort Captain Rogers back to SHIELD immediately for questioning.
Brock Rumlow: I told him. [Steve notices the vending machine next to him, we then see Steve walking towards Rumlow]
Steve Rogers: Let's go.
Brock Rumlow: Yeah. [to the agents] STRIKE, move it out. [as they leave we see that Steve has hid the flash drive behind a pack of gums in the vending machine]


[back at SHIELD, Steve is brought to Pierce who is talking to Agent 13]
Alexander Pierce: For whatever it's worth, you did your best.
Sharon Carter: Thank you, sir. [as she turns to leave she sees Steve] Captain Rogers. [Steve replies coldly as he walks towards Pierce]
Steve Rogers: Neighbor.
Alexander Pierce: Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.
Steve Rogers: Sir, it's an honor. [they shake hands]
Alexander Pierce: The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. [they enter Pierce's office where he shows Steve an old photo of Fury with Pierce] That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, ""No, we'll negotiate."" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.
Steve Rogers: So you gave him a promotion.
Alexander Pierce: I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?
Steve Rogers: I don't know.
Alexander Pierce: You know it was bugged?
Steve Rogers: I did, because Nick told me.
Alexander Pierce: Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? [Steve doesn't reply obviously not knowing this information] I want you to see something. [he brings up footage of Batroc being interrogated]
SHIELD Agent: Who hired you, Batroc?
Steve Rogers: Is that live?
Alexander Pierce: Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.
Alexander Pierce: No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.
Steve Rogers: Am I supposed to know who that is? [he hands Steve the file]
Alexander Pierce: Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?
Alexander Pierce: The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.
Steve Rogers: If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.
Alexander Pierce: Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. [he hesitates a moment] Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?
Steve Rogers: He told me not to trust anyone.
Alexander Pierce: I wonder if that included him. [Steve pauses a moment before replying]
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. [Steve picks up his shield, places it on his back and starts to make his out of the office]
Alexander Pierce: Captain. [Steve stops and looks at Pierce] Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Steve turns and leaves]


Steve Rogers: [after he leaves Pierce's office he steps into the elevator] Operations control.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [just as the elevator doors are about to close Rumlow steps in with two STRIKE agents]
Brock Rumlow: Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.
STRIKE Agent #1: Understood.
STRIKE Agent #2: Yes, sir.
Brock Rumlow: Forensics.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
Brock Rumlow: Cap.
Steve Rogers: Rumlow. [the elevator doors close and they start riding down]
Brock Rumlow: Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?
Steve Rogers: No, lets wait and see what it is first.
Brock Rumlow: Right. [Steve notices one of the agents touching his weapon suspiciously] [the elevator stops and more SHIELD and STRIKE agents enter]
SHIELD Agent #1: What's the status so far?
SHIELD Agent #2: Administrations level.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
SHIELD Agent #2: [to Steve] Excuse me.
Brock Rumlow: [to Steve] I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. [feeling something is off, Steve looks at the agents in the elevator and notices one of them is sweating, then the elevator stops and more agents enter]
STRIKE Agent #3: Records.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [as the elevator doors close Steve realizes he's been surrounded by agents]
Steve Rogers: Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? [there's a moment's pause before suddenly one of the agents turns and uses an electric rod to give Steve a shock, the others grab him and try to strap his wrists with magnetic cuffs, Steve manages to knock some of them down but one cuff remains, then Rumlow uses his rod to give Steve a shock] [as Steve is being attacked we see Sitwell in a controls room watching them from a monitor]
Jasper Sitwell: Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor. [Steve manages free himself from the magnetic cuff and knock all the agents down, he turns to Rumlow]
Brock Rumlow: Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal. [Rumlow then goes to attack Steve with his electric rod but Steve manages to defend himself and eventually knocks Rumlow out]
Steve Rogers: It kind of feels personal. [Steve picks up his shield then opens the elevator doors, but he's faced by a team of STRIKE agents pointing their weapons at him]
25th Floor STRIKE Agent: Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air! [Steve uses his shield to break off the elevator wires which sends the elevator down, as he forces the doors open he sees more STRIKE agents approaching him, he closes the door and looks for a way out]
STRIKE Agent: Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! [Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator and plummets down to finally hit the ground floor, from his monitor Sitwell watches in shock as Steve gets up and starts running off]
Jasper Sitwell: Are you kidding me? [ordering the STRIKE team] He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge! [Steve rides out of the SHIELD garage on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out but then a Quinjet emerges ahead of him]
Quinjet Pilot: Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. [the Quinjet lowers its machine gun] Repeat, stand down. [as Steve doesn't stop they start shooting at him, Steve throws his shield into the propellers to jam it, giving him an opportunity to hop onto it and do more damage to the jet with his shield before jumping off as the jet goes crashing down and he escapes]


Jasper Sitwell: [to the SHIELD agents] Eyes here. [everyone, including Agent 13, looks at Sitwell] Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.
Sharon Carter: With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.
Alexander Pierce: Because he lied to us. [Pierce enters the room] Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.


[disguised as a civilian dressed in a hoody, Steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine but sees it's gone, then Natasha appears behind him chewing some gum, in anger Steve pushes her into a room]
Steve Rogers: Where is it?
Natasha Romanoff: Safe.
Steve Rogers: Do better!
Natasha Romanoff: Where did you get it?
Steve Rogers: Why would I tell you?
Natasha Romanoff: Fury gave it to you. Why?
Steve Rogers: What's on it?
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know.
Steve Rogers: Stop lying!
Natasha Romanoff: I only act like I know everything, Rogers.
Steve Rogers: I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?
Natasha Romanoff: Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.
Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna ask you again.
Natasha Romanoff: I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.
Steve Rogers: So he's a ghost story.
Natasha Romanoff: Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. [she pulls up her shirt to show him the scar on the side of her stomach] Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. [there's a hit of a smile from Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. [Natasha holds up the flash drive] Like you said, he's a ghost story. [Steve takes the flash drive from her]
Steve Rogers: Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.


[Pierce is holding another virtual meeting with the World Security Council]
Alexander Pierce: Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.
Councilman Rockwell: You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.
Councilman Singh: Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...
Alexander Pierce: Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.
Councilwoman Hawley: That discussion can be tabled for a later time.
Alexander Pierce: But you do want to have a discussion.
Councilman Rockwell: We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.


[Steve and Natasha go to the mall disguised as a civilian couple]
Natasha Romanoff: First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.
Steve Rogers: If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off. [they go to a Mac store to use one of their computers]
Natasha Romanoff: The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.
Steve Rogers: How much time do we have?
Natasha Romanoff: Uh...about nine minutes from... [she pops the flash drive into a MacBook Pro] Now. [we see several SHIELD vehicles heading their way] Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.
Steve Rogers: Can you override it?
Natasha Romanoff: The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. [Rumlow and his team pull up outside the mall and head inside] [back at the Mac store, Steve and Natasha continue to try and find out what's on the flash drive] I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.
Apple Employee: Can I help you guys with anything?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.
Steve Rogers: Right! We're getting married.
Apple Employee: Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going? [Steve looks at the monitor and sees the signal traced to somewhere in New Jersey]
Steve Rogers: New Jersey.
Apple Employee: Oh. [the employee looks at Steve for a moment] I have the exact same glasses.
Natasha Romanoff: Wow, you two are practically twins.
Apple Employee: Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. [as Rumlow and his team are in the mall looking for Steve and Natasha] You said nine minutes, come on.
Natasha Romanoff: Shh, relax. Got it. [they find the signal is coming from Wheaton, NJ] You know it?
Steve Rogers: I used to. Let's go. [Steve pulls the flash drive from the computer and they walk out of the store] Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. [as two agents are coming straight towards them]
Natasha Romanoff: Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.
Steve Rogers: What?
Natasha Romanoff: Do it! [Steve quickly puts his arm around Natasha and laughs] [inside the Mac store one of the agents looks around]
Jack Rollins: Negative at the source.
Brock Rumlow: Give me a floor rundown.
SHIELD Agent #2: Negative on three.
SHIELD Agent #3: Negative on two.
Brock Rumlow: Snake the upper levels, work down to me. [as they are going down the escalator Natasha spots Rumlow on the escalator next to them going up, she turns to Steve]
Natasha Romanoff: Kiss me.
Steve Rogers: What?
Natasha Romanoff: Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.
Steve Rogers: Yes, they do. [she quickly pulls down Steve's head and kisses him making Rumlow look away as he goes past them on the escalator]
Natasha Romanoff: You still uncomfortable?
Steve Rogers: It's not exactly the word I would use.


[as they drive to New Jersey]
Natasha Romanoff: Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?
Steve Rogers: Nazi Germany.
Natasha Romanoff: Mm.
Steve Rogers: And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash. [Natasha takes her feet off the dash]
Natasha Romanoff: Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?
Steve Rogers: What?
Natasha Romanoff: Was that your first kiss since 1945?
Steve Rogers: That bad, huh?
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say that.
Steve Rogers: Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.
Natasha Romanoff: No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.
Steve Rogers: You don't need practice.
Natasha Romanoff: Everybody needs practice.
Steve Rogers: It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.
Natasha Romanoff: Nobody special, though? [Steve chuckles]
Steve Rogers: Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, that's alright, you just make something up.
Steve Rogers: What, like you?
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.
Steve Rogers: That's a tough way to live.
Natasha Romanoff: It's a good way not to die, though.
Steve Rogers: You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah. Who do you want me to be?
Steve Rogers: How about a friend? [Natasha laughs softly]
Natasha Romanoff: Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.


[the two pull up to outside an abandoned military base where the signal led them to]
Steve Rogers: This is it.
Natasha Romanoff: The file came from these coordinates.
Steve Rogers: So did I. [later that night as they walk around the base trying to pinpoint where the signal came from] This camp is where I was trained.
Natasha Romanoff: Changed much?
Steve Rogers: A little. [Steve has a brief visions of his former, smaller self running past him as he's getting trained with other soldiers]
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it! [his former self stops and stares at Steve as he is now] Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! [present Steve watches nostalgically as the former Steve runs off]
Natasha Romanoff: This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. [Steve notices a building ahead of them] What is it? [as they walk over to the building]
Steve Rogers: Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. [Steve opens the lock with his shield and they enter inside, when they turn on the lights they notice it's a SHIELD office]
Natasha Romanoff: This is SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Maybe where it started. [they enter a room where they find old framed portraits of Howard Stark, Peggy and Col. Chester Phillips]
Natasha Romanoff: There's Stark's father.
Steve Rogers: Howard.
Natasha Romanoff: Who's the girl? [Steve doesn't reply and turns away to walk further down the room and stops by a massive book shelf]
Steve Rogers: If you're already working in a secret office... [he pushes the books shelf and slides open to reveal an elevator behind it] Why do you need to hide the elevator? [they go down the elevator which takes them to a room with old looking computers]
Natasha Romanoff: This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient. [suddenly Natasha notices a small flash drive port, she places the flash drive in it which then activates the ancient computer in the room]
Computer: Initiate system? [Natasha types using the keyboard]
Natasha Romanoff: Y-E-S, spells yes. [Natasha smiles as the old computer starts to cranks up] ""Shall we play a game?"" [to Steve] It's from a movie that...
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I saw it. [suddenly they hear an accented voice speaking]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984. [they see an old camera moving above them as it analyzes them]
Natasha Romanoff: It's some kind of a recording.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I am not a recording, Fräulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am. [the computer screen shows an old photo of Dr. Arnim Zola]
Natasha Romanoff: Do you know this thing?
Steve Rogers: Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.
Dr. Arnim Zola: First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.
Steve Rogers: How did you get here?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Invited.
Natasha Romanoff: It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.
Dr. Arnim Zola: They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.
Steve Rogers: HYDRA died with the Red Skull.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.
Steve Rogers: Prove it.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Accessing archive. [the computer screen shows them old footage of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, of the how the original SHIELD founders] HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.
Natasha Romanoff: That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Accidents will happen. [the computer screen shows them HYDRA had killed Howard and Maria Stark making it look like a car accident along with the recent death of Fury] HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. [in anger Steve suddenly smashes the computer screen] As I was saying...
Steve Rogers: What's on this drive?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.
Natasha Romanoff: What kind of algorithm? What does it do?
Dr. Arnim Zola: The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. [suddenly the doors starts to close, Steve tries stops it by throwing his shield in between it but he's too late]
Natasha Romanoff: Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.
Steve Rogers: Who fired it?
Natasha Romanoff: S.H.I.E.L.D.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. [Steve notices a small opening on the ground, he throws the metal door aside and just as the place explodes he throws himself and Natasha into the hole and protects them with his shield, he then manages to get them out from under the building rubble just as STRIKE agents arrive to roam the area for them]
Brock Rumlow: [As he notices a footprint in the dust] Call in the asset.


[at his home, Pierce goes to his kitchen to get a drink when he sees the Winter Soldier sat behind behind him with his gun on the table when his housekeeper calls out]
Renata: I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?
Alexander Pierce: No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.
Renata: Okay, night-night.
Alexander Pierce: Good night. [Renata leaves] Want some milk? [the Winter Soldier doesn't reply] The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. [he pours himself a glass of milk and goes over to join the Winter Soldier at the table] They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours. [just then Renata interrupts them as she enters the kitchen]
Renata: Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone. [she notices the Winter Soldier]
Alexander Pierce: Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked. [Pierce picks up the gun from the table and shoots and kills her]


[returning home from his morning run Sam hears a knock at his door, he opens the door to see Steve and Natasha]
Sam Wilson: Hey, man.
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone we know is trying to kill us. [Sam pauses a moment before replying]
Sam Wilson: Not everyone. [Sam let's them enter, later as Steve and Natasha are cleaning up, Steve notices Natasha looking sad and thoughtful]
Steve Rogers: You okay?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.
Steve Rogers: What's going on?
Natasha Romanoff: When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.
Steve Rogers: There's a chance you might be in the wrong business. [Natasha smiles faintly]
Natasha Romanoff: I owe you.
Steve Rogers: It's okay.
Natasha Romanoff: If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?
Steve Rogers: I would now. And I'm always honest.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
Steve Rogers: Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.
Sam Wilson: [to Steve and Natasha] I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing. [later as they are sat in Sam's kitchen]
Natasha Romanoff: So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?
Steve Rogers: Pierce.
Natasha Romanoff: Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.
Steve Rogers: But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.
Natasha Romanoff: So was Jasper Sitwell.
Steve Rogers: So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?
Sam Wilson: The answer is: you don't. [Sam drops a file in front of Steve]
Steve Rogers: What's this?
Sam Wilson: Call it a resume. [Natasha picks up a photo of Sam with his para-rescue team]
Natasha Romanoff: Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you. [to Steve] You didn't say he was a para-rescue. [looking at the photo of Sam with his colleague]
Steve Rogers: Is this Riley?
Sam Wilson: Yeah.
Natasha Romanoff: I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?
Sam Wilson: No. These. [he hands Steve the file, Steve opens it and reads it]
Steve Rogers: I thought you said you were a pilot.
Sam Wilson: I never said pilot.
Steve Rogers: I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.
Sam Wilson: Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.
Steve Rogers: Where can we get our hands on one of these things?
Sam Wilson: The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall. [Steve looks at Natasha who shrugs her shoulders]
Steve Rogers: Shouldn't be a problem. [Steve throws down the file on the table and we see that it's a classified military project called Falcon]


[after their meeting is over Sitwell walks out of the building with Senator Stern]
Senator Stern: Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.
Jasper Sitwell: Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?
Senator Stern: Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?
Jasper Sitwell: Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.
Senator Stern: Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it. [he touches Sitwell's pin on his jacket] This is a nice pin.
Jasper Sitwell: Thank you.
Senator Stern: Come here. [they embrace and as they do Stern whispers to Sitwell] Hail, HYDRA. [as Stern steps away he touches his back] See, it's right there...
Jasper Sitwell: I just saw that, yeah.
Senator Stern: Should I get it checked?
Jasper Sitwell: I think you should. [Stern walks away] [Sitwell gets a call from Pierce, Sitwell turns to his men] I need a minute. Bring the car around. [his men leave and Sitwell answers the phone] Yes, sir?
Sam Wilson: Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.
Jasper Sitwell: Who is this?
Sam Wilson: The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock. [Sitwell looks around but doesn't see him] Your other ten o'clock. [Sitwell turns the other way and sees Sam sitting a few feet away from him] There you go.
Jasper Sitwell: What do you want?
Sam Wilson: You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.
Jasper Sitwell: And why would I do that?
Sam Wilson: Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up. [Sitwell looks down at his tie and sees a small red light from the gun being pointed at him] [Steve throws Sitwell across a rooftop, Natasha follows behind him]
Steve Rogers: Tell me about Zola's algorithm.
Jasper Sitwell: Never heard of it.
Steve Rogers: What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?
Jasper Sitwell: I was throwing up, I get seasick. [Steve forces Sitwell to the edge of the rooftop, Sitwell just smiles] Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.
Steve Rogers: You're right. It's not. It's hers. [Steve steps aside and Natasha kicks Sitwell off the roof, he plummets down screaming]
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?
Steve Rogers: Lillian. Lip piercing, right?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, she's cute.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm not ready for that. [suddenly, Sam, in his Falcon jet-pack suit with wings, flies up holding Sitwell and throws him down on the roof] [Steve and Natasha walk towards Sitwell, he holds his hand up in fear]
Jasper Sitwell: Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!
Steve Rogers: What targets?
Jasper Sitwell: You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.
Steve Rogers: The Future? How could it know? [Sitwell laughs]
Jasper Sitwell: How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. [Steve and Natasha look at him in confusion] Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.
Steve Rogers: And what then?
Jasper Sitwell: Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.
Steve Rogers: What then?!
Jasper Sitwell: Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.


Jasper Sitwell: [as Sam drives them to Triskelion] HYDRA doesn't like leaks.
Sam Wilson: So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.
Natasha Romanoff: Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.
Steve Rogers: I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.
Jasper Sitwell: What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea. [suddenly the Winter Soldier lands on the car roof, pulls Sitwell out through the window and throws him into the oncoming traffic, killing him, he then starts shooting at them until Steve pulls the break handle making the Winter Soldier drop down onto the street, as another car smashes into the trio's car and pushes them along, the Winter Soldier jumps back onto their car, smashes through the windscreen and pulls out the steering wheel]
Sam Wilson: Shit! [Natasha starts shooting at him but the Winter Soldier jumps onto the vehicle behind them, as the trio's car is being pulled off the road Steve holds on to the car door]
Steve Rogers: Hang on! [he breaks open the door, holding onto Natasha and Sam, they slide on the car door through the streets] [the Winter Soldier is joined by HYDRA agents and they start shooting at them, the trio scatter and run off in different directions with the Winter Soldier shooting at Natasha but she manages to shoot him in his eye goggle mask and run off]
Winter Soldier: Она у меня. Найди его. (She's mine. ([subtitled as:] I'll take care of her.) Find him.) [the Winter Soldier goes in pursuit of Natasha as the Hydra agents go after Steve and Sam who both manage to fend them off as they shoot at them, Steve then notices the Winter Soldier in pursuit of Natasha]
Sam Wilson: Go, I got this! [the Winter Soldier thinks he's found Natasha hiding behind a car as he can hear her voice]
Natasha Romanoff: I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened. [he rolls a bomb towards where he thinks she's hiding. As the bomb rolls behind the car we see that Natasha isn't actually there but a recording over her voice is being played back on a phone] I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. [as the bomb explodes Natasha jumps onto the Winter Soldiers back and tries to kill him but he throws her off, she starts running off as he goes after her]
Natasha Romanoff: [to the civilians as she tries to get away from the Winter Soldier] Get out of the way! Stay out of the way! [suddenly she gets shot in the shoulder, she falls and looks around her, as the Winter Soldier comes up from behind to shoot her Steve jumps in and attacks him, they fight and in the process the Winter Soldier takes Steve's shield and throws it at him but Steve manages to avoid being hit, after battling it out more the Winter Soldier's mask comes off, as he looks around at Steve we learn the true identity of the Winter Soldier; Bucky Barnes]
Steve Rogers: Bucky?
Bucky Barnes: Who the hell is Bucky? [as Bucky goes to shoot at Steve Sam flies in and kicks Bucky aside, Bucky takes aim again but before he can shoot Natasha uses the grenade launcher Bucky dropped earlier to shoot at Bucky who vanishes in the smoke of the explosion, then the trio hear sirens after which they are surrounded by HYDRA agents being led by Rumlow]
Brock Rumlow: Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down! [Steve holds his hands up] Get on your knees! Down! [he kicks Steve's leg and Steve kneels down] Don't move. [Rumlow looks at the helicopter flying above them and warns Rollins who's holding Steve at gunpoint] Put the gun down. Not here. Not here! [Rollins lowers his gun, the HYDRA agents then take Steve, Sam, and Natasha into custody]


[as the trio is being escorted in a van]
Steve Rogers: It was him. He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.
Sam Wilson: How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.
Steve Rogers: Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...
Natasha Romanoff: None of that's your fault, Steve.
Steve Rogers: Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky. [Sam notices Natasha is bleeding from her shoulder and looks at the guards]
Sam Wilson: We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck. [suddenly one of the guards pulls out an electric rod and neutralizes the other guard and knocks him out, the guard is revealed to be Hill as she takes off her helmet]
Maria Hill: Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain. [Sam looks at her in confusion; to Steve] Who's this guy? [Rumlow's crew stop their vehicles and get out]
Brock Rumlow: Three holes. Start digging. [they go over to the van holding Steve, Sam and Natasha and as they open the door they find it empty with one of the guards left unconscious and massive burnt whole on the car floor]


[Hill has taken the trio to a secret facility, a man runs towards them; referring to Natasha's wound]
Maria Hill: GSW. She's lost at least a pint.
Sam Wilson: Maybe two.
Doctor: Let me take her.
Maria Hill: She'll want to see him first. [Hill takes them to Fury who's alive and lying in bed, the trio look at him in shock]
Nick Fury: About damn time. [later as Natasha's wound is being treated] Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.
Doctor: Don't forget your collapsed lung.
Nick Fury: Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.
Natasha Romanoff: They cut you open, your heart stopped.
Nick Fury: Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.
Steve Rogers: Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?
Maria Hill: Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.
Nick Fury: Can't kill you if you're already dead. Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.


[inside a bank vault, the HYDRA agents fix Bucky's metal arm and as they do so he has a brief flashback to his old life after he was recovered by Zola and the HYDRA agents]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sergeant Barnes... [he has to flashback to falling off the train at the edge of the mountain with Steve trying to save him]
Steve Rogers: Bucky, no! [he then has flashback to after he's picked up by Hydra agents]
Dr. Arnim Zola: The procedure has already started. [we see the Zola and the Hydra agent amputating his left arm and replacing with the metal arm] You are to be the new fist of HYDRA. [to his men] Put him on ice. [we see Bucky being frozen after which he comes back to the present and knocks over the HYDRA agent fixing his arm, Rollins points his gun at him to stop him attacking any further] [as Pierce enters the bank vault Bucky is being held in]
Scientist #1: Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic. [Pierce enters with Rumlow and some other HYDRA agents and goes over to Bucky]
Alexander Pierce: Mission report. [Bucky; looking blank, doesn't respond] Mission report, now. [Pierce moves closer to Bucky and suddenly strikes him hard in the face]
Bucky Barnes: The man on the bridge... [he has flashback to Steve calling him by his name] Who was he?
Alexander Pierce: You met him earlier this week on another assignment.
Bucky Barnes: I knew him. [Pierce sits in front of Bucky]
Alexander Pierce: Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos. Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push. But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine, and HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.
Bucky Barnes: But I knew him. [Pierce turns to the scientists]
Alexander Pierce: Prep him.
Scientist #1: He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.
Alexander Pierce: Then wipe him and start over. [the scientists strap Bucky in his chair and then place a teeth shield in his mouth as they begin the process of wiping his brain with Bucky screaming in pain]


[back at the secret facility]
Nick Fury: [looking at a photo of Pierce] This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said, ""Peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility."" See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.
Natasha Romanoff: We have to stop the launch.
Nick Fury: I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore. [Fury opens a case containing three chips]
Sam Wilson: What's that?
Maria Hill: Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponized.
Nick Fury: We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.
Maria Hill: One or two won't cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die.
Nick Fury: We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We need to get pass them, insert the server blades, and maybe, just maybe, we can salvage what's left...
Steve Rogers: We're not salvaging anything. We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick, we're taking down SHIELD.
Nick Fury: SHIELD had nothing to do with it.
Steve Rogers: You gave me this mission, this is how it ends. SHIELD's been compromised, you said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.
Nick Fury: Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.
Steve Rogers: And how many paid the price before you did?
Nick Fury: Look, I didn't know about Barnes.
Steve Rogers: Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.
Maria Hill: He's right. [Fury looks at Natasha then Sam]
Sam Wilson: Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.
Nick Fury: Well... Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.


[Steve stands on a bridge and has a flashback to the time he spent with Bucky after Steve's mother's funeral]
Bucky Barnes: We looked for you after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery. [they walk towards Steve's apartment]
Steve Rogers: I know, I'm sorry. I just...kind of wanted to be alone.
Bucky Barnes: How was it?
Steve Rogers: It was okay. She's next to Dad.
Bucky Barnes: I was gonna ask...
Steve Rogers: I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...
Bucky Barnes: We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash. [as they get to the apartment door, Steve tries to find his keys, Bucky kicks a brick aside, picks up the apartment keys from under it and gives it to Steve] Come on.
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.
Bucky Barnes: The thing is, you don't have to. [Bucky gives Steve a friendly pat on the shoulder] I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.


[Steve's thoughts of Bucky are interrupted as Sam joins him on the bridge]
Sam Wilson: He's gonna be there, you know?
Steve Rogers: I know.
Sam Wilson: Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.
Steve Rogers: I don't know if I can do that.
Sam Wilson: Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn't know you.
Steve Rogers: He will. Gear up, it's time. [Steve turns and starts to walk off]
Sam Wilson: You gonna wear that?
Steve Rogers: No. If you're gonna fight a war, you gotta wear a uniform. [later as a guard walks in the Smithsonian Museum when he looks over to the Captain America exhibit he notices the Captain America WWII uniform on that was on the dummy has been stolen]
Smithsonian Guard: Oh, man. I am so fired!


[at the Triskelion where the Helicarriers are being held]
Man on PA: We are in final launch sequence.
SHIELD Tech: We are go on guidance.
Woman on PA: All personnel to launch station.
[Pierce meets the World Security Council as they arrive at the Triskelion]
Alexander Pierce: And how was your flight?
Councilman Hawley: Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.
Alexander Pierce: Sadly, SHIELD can't control everything.
Councilman Rockwell: Including Captain America. [Pierce walks over to one of the guards who hands him a case containing four pins]
Alexander Pierce: This facility is biometrically controlled, and these will give you unrestricted access. [the council members each take a pin to wear]
[at the Project Insight headquarters]
Com Tech #1: I've been parking there for two months.
Com Tech #2: But it's his spot.
Com Tech #1: So where's he been?
Com Tech #2: I think Afghanistan.
Com Tech #1: [into his earpiece] Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full. [to his colleague] Well, he could have said something. [suddenly they hear a sharp noise through their earpiece] Ow!
Com Tech #2: Must be the dish.
Com Tech #1: I'll check it out.
Man on PA: Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.
[as the Tech goes and opens the door he's faced with Steve, Sam and Hill on the other side of the door, Sam and Hill point their guns at him]
Steve Rogers: Excuse us. [the tech holds his hands up and steps aside to let them enter]
Alexander Pierce: [addressing the World Security Council members] I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful. [as they start drinking to Pierce's toast suddenly they hear Steve over the SHIELD microphone that everyone in the building can hear]
Steve Rogers: Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not. [as Steve finishes his speech]
Sam Wilson: Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? [to Pierce after learning the truth about him]
Councilman Rockwell: You smug son of a bitch.
Councilman Singh: [to the two HYDRA agents enter the room, thinking they are SHIELD agents] Arrest him. [the HYDRA agent points his gun at Singh]
Alexander Pierce: I guess I've got the floor.
[Rumlow and his men break into the control room, where Agent 13 also is, Rumlow walks over to one of the techs]
Brock Rumlow: Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now. [The tech hesitates visibly.] Is there a problem?
SHIELD Tech: I'm... [the tech shakes his head nervously]
Brock Rumlow: Is there a problem?
SHIELD Tech: I'm sorry, sir. [the tech takes a few nervous breaths before replying] I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders. [Rumlow points his gun at the tech's head]
Brock Rumlow: Move away from your station. [Agent 13 walks over to Rumlow pointing her gun at him]
Sharon Carter: Like he said! [suddenly all the SHIELD agents draw their weapons and point them at Rumlow] Captain's orders.
Brock Rumlow: You picked the wrong side, Agent.
Sharon Carter: Depends on where you're standing. [Rumlow drops his gun, but as he does he grabs his knife and cuts Agent 13's arm, leading to the SHIELD agents firing their guns, amidst the bullets, Rumlow manages to release the Helicarriers and runs off]
[as the bay doors holding the Helicarriers are about to be opened]
SHIELD Agent: Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door! [the HYDRA agents enter and start shooting and killing the crew and techs; at the headquarters Hill watches on the monitor as the Helicarriers are being initiated]
Maria Hill: They're initiating launch.


[Steve and Sam make their way to the Helicarriers]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?
Steve Rogers: If they're shooting at you, they're bad. [Sam, in his Falcon suit, flies off and Steve heads down, the HYDRA agents starting shooting at them, Sam flies around avoiding getting shot]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about.
Steve Rogers: You okay?
Sam Wilson: [flying off as the HYDRA agents continue to shoot at him] I'm not dead yet.
[Pierce watches from the window the commotion caused by Steve and Sam trying to stop the Helicarriers launching, he turns to Singh]
Alexander Pierce: Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution? [Pierce hands Singh a glass of champagne] And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?
Councilman Singh: Not if it was your switch. [Singh tosses the glass aside, one of the HYDRA agents hands Pierce his gun and Pierce points it at Singh, suddenly Hawley kicks Singh away, then takes down the other HYDRA agents in the room before taking the gun and pointing at Pierce, she then removes her disguise to reveal it's Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?
Charlie Weapons Tech: [referring to the Helicarriers] Satellites in range at three thousand feet.
Maria Hill: Falcon, status?
Sam Wilson: Engaging. [Sam manages to fly down to the Hellicarrier bay taking down the HYDRA jets chasing him] Alright, Cap, I'm in. [just then another HYDRA jets heads his way and starts shooting at him] Shit! [Sam manages to fly off and avoid getting hit, meanwhile Steve is fighting off the HYDRA agents as he tries to get inside the Helicarrier]
Maria Hill: Eight minutes, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Working on it.
Councilman Rockwell: [to Natasha who is on the computer] What are you doing?
Alexander Pierce: She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.
Natasha Romanoff: Including HYDRA's.
Alexander Pierce: And SHIELD's. If you do this, non of your past is gonna remain hidden. [Natasha continues typing into the computer] Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?
Natasha Romanoff: Are you?
[Control center of Helicarrier Alpha]
Steve Rogers: Alpha locked.
Maria Hill: Falcon, where are you now?
Sam Wilson: I had to take a detour! [Sam is flying towards one of the Helicarriers when heat-seeking missiles are shot at him by HYDRA, so he flies back towards the Helicarrier and manages to get the missiles that were aimed at him to hit the Helicarrier giving him entrance] Oh, yeah! [Sam flies into the Helicarrier; to Hill] I'm in. Bravo locked. [Sam flies out of the carrier]
Maria Hill: Two down, one to go.


SHIELD Pilot: All SHIELD pilots, scramble. We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got. [suddenly Bucky appears and starts firing at the SHIELD pilots and agents killing them all after which he gets into one of the jets and flies off; back inside the building with Natasha, Pierce and the council members]
Alexander Pierce: Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes two Alpha Level members.
Natasha Romanoff: Don't worry, company's coming. [just then a helicopter appears outside, lands and Fury steps out to enter the building to Pierce's surprise]
Alexander Pierce: Did you get my flowers? [Fury looks at him coldly] I'm glad you're here, Nick.
Nick Fury: Really? Cause I thought you had me killed.
Alexander Pierce: You know how the game works.
Nick Fury: So why make me head of SHIELD?
Alexander Pierce: Cause you were the best and the most ruthless person I ever met.
Nick Fury: I did what I did to protect people.
Alexander Pierce: Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.
Nick Fury: No, I have the courage not to. [Fury takes Pierce to the retinal scanner with Natasha pointing her gun at him]
SHIELD Computer: Retinal scanner active.
Alexander Pierce: You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?
Nick Fury: I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary... [Fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred dead eye] You need to keep both eyes open. [they both look into the retinal scanner with Fury using his dead eye]
SHIELD Computer: Alpha Level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.
[back with Hill at the headquarters]
Maria Hill: Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow. [she notices two HYDRA agents making breaking into the headquarters, she shoots and kills them as they enter] Six minutes. [Steve is trying to get away from the HYDRA agents shooting at him on the Helicarrier]
Steve Rogers: Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.
Sam Wilson: Roger! Let me know when you're ready. [Steve just manages to jump off the edge as a HYDRA agent shoots a missile at him]
Steve Rogers: I just did! [Sam flies in just in time to catch Steve] [Sam flies himself and Steve onto the last Helicarrier]
Sam Wilson: You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.
Steve Rogers: I had a big breakfast. [suddenly Bucky appears and pushes Steve off the edge]
Sam Wilson: Steve! [as Sam goes to fly off and help Steve Bucky grabs one of his wings and throws him back, Sam starts shooting at Bucky and as he goes to fly off Bucky uses his weapon to rip off one of Sam's wings and kicks him off the Helicarrier, Sam manages to get his parachute out and lands on the roof of the Triskelion] Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay? [we see Steve is holding onto the side of the Helicarrier]
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm here! I'm still on the Helicarrier. [he pulls himself up] Where are you?
Sam Wilson: I'm grounded, the suit's down. Sorry, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Don't worry, I got it. [Bucky watches Steve from above the Helicarrier] [as everyone at the Triskelion is rushing around trying to evacuate the building Rumlow fights and kills some SHIELD agents]
SHIELD Agent: All SHIELD agents regroup at Rally Point Delta. [Romlow kills the speaker and another three agents.]
HYDRA Dispatch: [on radio] Sir, Council's been breached.
Brock Rumlow: Repeat, dispatch.
HYDRA Dispatch: Black Widow's up there.
Brock Rumlow: Headed up! [Hill notices Rumlow on the monitor]
Maria Hill: Falcon?
Sam Wilson: Yeah?
Maria Hill: Rumlow's headed for the Council.
Sam Wilson: I'm on it.


[inside the Helicarrier Steve is confronted by Bucky]
Steve Rogers: People are gonna die, Buck. I can't let that happen. [Bucky stares at him coldly] Please, don't make me do this. [seeing Bucky won't back down Steve throws his shield at him and they start battling each other, as they fight Steve manages to bring up the targeting blade system, but as Bucky attacks him the chip falls from Steve's hand; back at the Council]
Natasha Romanoff: Done. [she looks at her mobile device] And it's trending. [just then Pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, causing it to burn deeply into their sternum, Natasha and Fury points their guns at Pierce; to Natasha]
Alexander Pierce: Unless you want two inch hole in your sternum, I'd put that gun down. [Natasha doesn't back down] That was armed the moment you pinned it on. [Fury and Natasha reluctantly lower their weapons]
[back at the Helicarrier as they are battling it out, Bucky stabs Steve in the shoulder with his knife and then grabs the fallen chip, but Steve manages to get the knife out, grab Bucky by the throat and throws him down, armlocks him.]
Steve Rogers: Drop it! Drop it! [as Bucky continues to hold the chip, Steve breaks his arm and holds onto his throat until he passes out and lets go of the chip, Steve then grabs the chip and rushes off; back at the Triskelion]
[An office in the SHIELD HQ]
Brock Rumlow: I'm on forty-one, headed towards the south-west stairwell. [just then Sam attacks Rumlow but Rumlow manages to knock Sam down] This is gonna hurt. There are no prisoners with HYDRA, just order. And order only comes through pain. You ready for yours?
Sam Wilson: Man, shut the hell up. [they both go to attack each other]
Alexander Pierce: Lieutenant, how much longer?
Charlie XO: [on radio] Sixty-five seconds to satellite link. Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now.
Maria Hill: [to Steve as she watches from the monitor] One minute. [Steve desperately tries to get back up to the Helicarriers to get to the targeting system when Bucky becomes conscious and shoots at Steve in the left thigh and then the right shoulder, but Steve still manages to climb up] Thirty seconds, Cap!
Steve Rogers: Stand by. [he gets the chip out] Charlie... [Bucky shoots Steve in the stomach and he falls]
[On the helicarrier's bridge]
Charlie Weapons Tech: We've reached three thousand feet. Sat link coming online now.
Charlie XO: Deploy algorithm.
Charlie Weapons Tech: Algorithm deployed.
Alexander Pierce: [on radio] We are go to targets. [Hill watches as the weapons are being targeted at Washington, the White house, the Pentagon, Stark Tower, aiming to kill over 700,00 people.]
Charlie Weapons Tech: Target saturation reached. All targets assigned.
Charlie XO: Fire when ready.
Charlie Weapons Tech: Firing in, three, two, one. [at that moment Steve manages to get up and place the chip in the Helicarrier's targeting blade overriding the system and locking it down]
Steve Rogers: Charlie locked. [as they watch the targets go offline]
Charlie XO: Where are the targets? Where are the targets?
Maria Hill: Okay, Cap, get out of there. [Hill then gets the Helicarriers weapon targets to open fire upon each other]
Steve Rogers: Fire now.
 Maria Hill: But, Steve...
Steve Rogers: Do it! Do it now! [reluctantly Hill makes the Helicarriers open fire on each other, Steve still inside the Helicarrier looks at Bucky below him; back at the Triskelion Pierce watches the Helicarriers as they are firing at each other]
Alexander Pierce: What a waste.
Natasha Romanoff: Are you still on the fence about Rogers' chances?
Alexander Pierce: Time to go, Councilwoman. This way, come on. You're gonna fly me out of here. [as Pierce starts to leave with Natasha]
Nick Fury: You know, there was a time I would have taken a bullet for you.
Alexander Pierce: You already did. You will again when it's useful. [just then Natasha activates a small disc that emits an electric shock through her whole body and disables the pin, this gives Fury a chance to shoot Pierce, which he does so twice, Fury then walks over to Natasha who is lying unconscious on the floor]
Nick Fury: Romanoff! Natasha! Natasha, come on! [Natasha opens her eyes]
Natasha Romanoff: Ow. Those really do sting.
Alexander Pierce: [as the Helicarriers continue to destroy each other Pierce lies on the floor and says with his last dieing breath] Hail HYDRA. [just then one Helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the Triskelion] [as the Helicarrier continues to fall with Cap and Winter Soldier inside, at the Triskelion Sam and Rumlow continue to fight each other]
Brock Rumlow: You're out of your depth, kid. [suddenly the first Helicarrier crashes into the Triskelion, catching Rumlow in the destruction]
Sam Wilson: [to Natasha who is in the helicopter as he sprints away] Please, tell me you got that chopper in the air!
Natasha Romanoff: Sam, where are you?
Sam Wilson: 41st floor, north-west corner!
Natasha Romanoff: We're on it, stay where you are. [Sam desperately tries to get away from the destruction the Helicarrier is causing to the building] Not an option! [as the building is being destroyed Sam jumps out of the window as Natasha and Fury fly their chopper barely in time to catch him]
Sam Wilson: 41st floor! 41st!
Nick Fury: It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building!
Natasha Romanoff: Hill, where's Steve? You got a location on Rogers?
[inside the third Helicarrier we see Steve help Bucky out from being trapped under some fallen rubble]
Steve Rogers: You know me. [Bucky lashes out at Steve in anger]
Bucky Barnes: No, I don't!
Steve Rogers: Bucky, you've known me your whole life. [Bucky hits Steve but Steve chooses not to fight back] Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. [Bucky hits Steve again]
Bucky Barnes: Shut up! [Steve takes off his mask and drops his shield out of the Helicarrier]
Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna fight you. You're my friend. [Bucky pushes Steve to the ground]
Bucky Barnes: You're my mission. [he then mercilessly punches Steve repeatedly across the face] You're my mission!
Steve Rogers: Then finish it. [Bucky hesitates holding his fist up] Cause I'm with you to the end of the line. [Bucky looks at Steve as if he's starting to remember just then the bottom of the Helicarrier falls sending Steve down into the river below as Bucky watches from the Helicarrier, then we see an unconscious Steve being pulled out of the water and dragged onto the shore by Bucky before he turns and walks away]


[In a hospital, in a room guarded by two armed agents, we see Steve waking up in a bed to hear Marvin Gaye's ""Trouble Man"" playing with Sam sat next to his bed]
Steve Rogers: On your left. [Sam looks at Steve and smiles]
[we then see Agent 13 practicing shooting at a shooting range wearing a CIA t-shirt; we see Hill at Stark Industries about to undergo a lie detector test; then Senator Stern getting arrested and then a badly burnt Rumlow being treated by doctors at the hospital; Natasha is then being sworn in at a committee hearing]
Bailiff: Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
Natasha Romanoff: I do.
Committee General: Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know what there is left left for him to say. I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.
Committee General: Well, he could explain how this country's expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.
Natasha Romanoff: HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.
Committee General: Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.
Scudder: Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna put me in a prison. You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?
Scudder: Do enlighten us.
Natasha Romanoff: Because you need us. Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we helped make it that way. But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it. So if you want to arrest me, arrest me. You'll know where to find me. [she gets up and walks away, meanwhile Fury gets rid of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them and his hiding place]


Nick Fury: [wearing sunglasses and hoodie, Fury meets Steve and Sam at a cemetery at his own grave] So, you've experienced this sort of thing before?
Steve Rogers: You get used to it. [we see Fury's gravestone which bears bears the epitaph ""The path of the righteous man. Ezekiel 25:17""]
Nick Fury: We've been data-mining HYDRA's files. Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship. I'm headed to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.
Steve Rogers: There's something I gotta do first.
Nick Fury: How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.
Sam Wilson: I'm more of a soldier than a spy.
Nick Fury: Alright then. [Sam and Steve shake Fury's hand] Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here. [Fury looks to his gravestone and walks away, just then Natasha joins Steve and Sam]
Natasha Romanoff: You should be honored, that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.
Steve Rogers: Not going with him?
Natasha Romanoff: No.
Steve Rogers: Not staying here?
Natasha Romanoff: I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.
Steve Rogers: That might take a while.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm counting on it. That thing you asked for, I called in a few favors from Kiev. [she hands Steve a file titled ""дело No 17"" (file No 17)] Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.
Steve Rogers: She's not a nurse.
Natasha Romanoff: And you're not a SHIELD agent.
Steve Rogers: What was her name again?
Natasha Romanoff: Sharon. She's nice. [she kisses Steve on the cheek and turns to walk away] Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread. [as Natasha walks away Steve opens the file, which is about Bucky and the information regarding his Winter Soldier transformation, Sam walks over to Steve]
Sam Wilson: You're going after him?
Steve Rogers: You don't have to come with me.
Sam Wilson: I know. When do we start?


[mid-credits scene; at an underground HYDRA lab Baron Wolfgang von Strucker is talking with a HYDRA scientist]
List: It's over. Fury has released everything to the public.
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: Everything he knows about.
List: Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA...
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: HYDRA, SHIELD, two sides of a coin that's no longer currency. [they walk over to the corner of the lab where Loki's scepter is being kept] What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew. We've only scratched the surface and already... [they start walking out of the lab] There are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends. Keep them off our scent.
List: What about the volunteers?
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.
List: And the survivors?
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: The twins. [we see the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, being kept in glass cells each exhibiting their powers, Pietro having superhuman speed and Wanda having telekinetic powers] Sooner or later they will meet the twins. It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.


(The post-credits scene; at the Captain America exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum we see Bucky in civilian clothes staring pensively at the display about himself.)

 Ant-Man and the Wasp
 Avengers: Endgame
     
[Marvel Studios Opening Sequence begins but instead of seeing our heroes, We see Our Watcher Informant Stan ""The Man"" Lee and his cameos. In the end of the intro, a white text appears reading ""Thank You Stan"".]
[Early morning, Vers has woken up from a dream and is now standing outside Yon-Rogg's room. When she knocks, Yon-Roog answers the door still half-asleep]
Yon-Rogg [annoyed and tired]: Do you know what time it is?
Vers: Can't sleep.
Yon-Rogg: There are tabs for that.
Vers: Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.
Yon-Rogg: Dreams again?
(Vers nods in response. Yon-Rogg does so as well.)
Vers: Wanna fight?
[Scene changes to Vers falling over. The camera then pans to show a doji-like structure, with Vers and Yon-Rogg on a mat]
Vers: I slipped.
Yon-Rogg: Right. You slipped as a result of me punching you in the face.
Vers: I was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face. The two events are not related.
Yon-Rogg [amused]: Tell me about this dream.
[Vers and Yon-Rogg start to spar]
Yon-Rogg: Anything new?
Vers: No.
[Vers and Yon-Rogg continue to spar. Yon-Rogg grabs Vers' right arm and pins it behind her]
Yon-Rogg: You've got to let go of your past.
CVers: I don't remember my past.
Yon-Rogg: It's causing you doubt, and doubt makes you vulnerable.
[Yon-Rogg lets go of Vers' arm and they continue to spar. Vers then is forced onto the floor, and her fist begins to glow orange]
Yon-Rogg: Control it.
[Vers' fist returns to normal]
Yon-Rogg: Lose control again and you'll have to convene with the Supreme Intelligence. There is nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.
[Vers smirks at Yon-Rogg causing Yon-Rogg to push her backwards]
Yon-Rogg: Humor is a distraction. And anger? Anger only serves the enemy.
[Yon-Rogg continue to fight. Yon-Rogg puches Vers in the face causing her to fall down. Vers retaliates by shooting energy from her fist, resulting in Yon-Rogg flying backwards]
[Scene changes to outside of a futuristic train station. There are electronic billboards on buildings, and blue and orange lights can be seen through windows]
Electronic Voice-Over (from billboard): 120 days since the last Skrull attack.
[The scene then changes to Vers and Yon-Rogg inside of a train carrage, surrounded by other Kree]
Vers: Has anybody seen what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?
Yon-Rogg: No-one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form. You know that. Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us. So it's sacred, it's personal. The Kree divulges it ever.
Vers: Who do you see? Your brother?
Yon-Rogg: No.
Vers: Father?
Yon-Rogg (annoyed): No
Vers: Your old commander?
Yon-Rogg: Vers...
Vers: (smug): It's me you see, isn't it?
Yon-Rogg (amused): I see what you're trying to do.
Vers: (laughing): Is it working?
Yon-Rogg: Yes. But you won't succeed in changing my mind on the subject.
Vers: What is the point of giving me these [gestures to her hands] if you don't want me to use them?
Yon-Rogg: You're going to use them. The Supreme Intelligence made me the responsibility of showing you how to use them.
Vers: I know how.
Yon-Rogg: Well if that were true, you'd knock me down without them.
[Carol pulls a face then punches Yon-Rogg in his arm]
Yon-Rogg: Control your impulses. Stop using this [points to her chest, above her heart] and start using this [gestures towards her head]. I need you to be the best version of yourself.
[Scene changes to the inside of the Supreme Intelligence. The walls appear golden, with pillars wider towards the top and narrowing towards the bottom. The floor has a hexagon lit up with white light. Vers walks onto the hexagon and extends her arms beside her. Tentacle-like wires appear from below her feet and connect to her legs, arms, and head.]
[The scene changes again, but the wires have disappeared and the walls have been replaced with an endless glossy floor. Lights then descend from above and the Supreme Intelligence appears from within them.]
Supreme Intelligence: Vers.
Vers: Intelligence.
Supreme Intelligence: Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.
Vers: I am.
Supreme Intelligence: You struggle with your emotions, with your past which fuels them.
[A floating image of the Earth appears, which Vers turns to look at. The image then turns into a variety of planets, with the camera switching slowly between them.]
Supreme Intelligence: You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion that has threatened our civilisation for centuries. Imposters who silently infiltrate then take over our planets.
[The image then zooms into one of the planets, revealing a Skrull carrying a weapon similar to in Vers' dream.]
Supreme Intelligence: Horrors which you remember and so much which you do not.
Vers: It's all... blank. My life. You're supposed to take the form of you I most admire but I don't even remember who this person was to me.
Supreme Intelligence: Perhaps this is a mercy, sparing you from a deeper pain. Freeing you to do what all Kree must. Put your people's needs before your own. We've given you a great gift, a chance to fight for the good of all Kree.
[The chip on Vers' neck begins to blink, almost simultaneously her hands begin to glow.]
Vers: I want to serve.
Supreme Intelligence: Then master yourself; what was given can be taken away.
[Vers' chip and her hand stop glowing]
Vers: I won't let you down.
Supreme Intelligence: We'll know soon enough. You have a mission. Serve well and with honor.
[The scene suddenly changes back to inside the Supreme Intelligence building and the wires slide back to underneath Vers' feet.]
[The scene changes to a shot of Vers, and Yon-Rogg's team walking towards a space ship within a hanger. The hanger is large, the walls are golden, and the team is wearing a green and black uniform.]
Att-Lass: This can't be good.
Korath: It must be another Skrull attack.
Bron-Char: Whatever it is, it's big.
Minn-Erva: Has a Skrull ever simmed you?
Korath: Once. It was deeply disturbing.
Vers: Why?
Korath: Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy and the face staring back was my own.
Vers: Well maybe if you were more attractive then it would be less disturbing.
Korath: You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.
Att-Lass: You never laugh.
Korath: I laugh on the inside. I'm not doing it now.
Bron-Char: It's funny cause objectively speaking, you're quite handsome.
Korath: Well thank you.
Yon-Rogg: Listen up team! Knock it off (pointing at Carol).
[Yon-Rogg walks into the center of the plane and begins presenting a holographic presentation.]
Yon-Rogg: Alright, prepare for a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr. The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet, this time Torfa. Soh-Larr sent a warning signal, which we've intercepted, that his cover's blown. The Skrull General Talos has sent kill units to find him. Should they reach him before we do, the intelligence he has acquired over three years is as good as theirs. The accusors will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south. We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr and we get out, leaving them none the wiser. The Torfa populace; we are not to interfere with them nor them with us. Nothing compromises the security of our mission. Proceed with caution. Follow protocol before extracting him.
[The holograph disappears, leaving the team standing in a circle.]
Yon-Rogg: This is a dangerous mission, we must all be ready to join the collective if that is our fate today. For the good of all Kree!
Vers, Bron-Char, Korath, Minn-Erva and Att-Lass: For the good of all Kree!
[The scene changes to show the ship and the Accusor's ships flying out of the hanger and towards the horizon towards a jump hole. Once they all pass through the jump hole, the scene changes to show the ships leaving the hole, surrounded by empty space and approaching the planet Torfa.]
[The Accusor's ships begin firing missiles down towards the Skrull stronghold down on Torfa. The ship containing Vers, Yon-Rogg and the other Kree follows after the missiles and crash lands in the sea. Carol and the Kree then emerge from the ship wearing masks and their green and black uniform. The Kree then swim from their ship before removing their masks.]
Yon-Rogg: Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon. Att-Lass and Minn-Erva find elevation.
[The camera follows the Kree sneaking towards the stronghold, amongst pillars of rock and mountains.]
Minn-Erva: Locals on the periphery. Maybe a dozen.
[Static noise is heard coming from Yon-Rogg's earwig]
Yon-Rogg: Minn-Erva?
Minn-Erva: Do you read me? Anybody copy?
[Static noise is heard coming from Yon-Rogg's earwig.]
Yon-Rogg: Repeat.
Vers: His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.
Yon-Rogg: No. This is the perfect spot for an ambush. Only one way in, only one way out.
Bron-Char: And we have to pass the locals.
Yon-Rogg: We don't know if they are locals. Too risky.
Vers: You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.
Yon-Rogg: No! You won't.
[Yon-Rogg looks around, assessing his surroundings.]
Yon-Rogg: Right. Keep a close radius, we lose comms we meet back at the Helion. Come on.
[The scene then changes to show the thermal imaging through one of the Kree's guns, showing the locals moving towards an area.]
Minn-Erva: Att-Lass, you getting this?
Att-Lass: Copy. I see them.
[The scene changes to the Kree walking amongst pillars of rock towards the local's campsite.]
Locals: {Untranslated syllables}
Yon-Rogg: Get back!
Bron-Char: Commander!
Yon-Rogg: Get back. Back!
Locals: [commotion amongst the group]
Yon-Rogg: Minn-Erva, do you have eyes on this?
[The Kree draw their weapons and face the locals.]
Yon-Rogg: (to the locals) Get back! Minn-Erva!
Minn-Erva: Does anybody copy?
Locals: {untranslated syllables} [commotion amongst the group]
Yon-Rogg: I don't want to hurt you. Get back! Stay back!
[The scene changes to the view through Minn-Erva's gun. The locals continue to move towards the Kree, and Minn-Erva prepares to shoot before Att-Lass lowers her gun.]
Att-Lass: They're locals. I found two dead, no green. They're just starving.
[Minn-Erva sees Att-Lass fighting against the locals through the scope of her gun. The Skrull disguised as Att-Lass begins to fight Minn-Erva, before Minn-Erva shoots him in the chest]
[The scene changes to Vers trying to locate Soh-Larr in the temple. When she sees somebody, the tablet in her arm lights up showing a string of characters.]
Vers: HGX-78
Soh-Larr: TRT79-VVX6
[The scene changes back to Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char surrounded by the locals]
Locals: {untranslated shouting}
Bron-Char: Get back!
[One of the locals draws a Skrull weapon before being shot by Minn-Erva. Minn-Erva continues to shoot the locals surrounding Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char]
Yon-Rogg: Skrulls!
[The scene changes back to Vers and Soh-Larr, with Soh-Larr sitting exhausted against a rock.]
Yon-Rogg (through Vers' earpiece): Vers? Skrulls! It's an ambush.
[Soh-Larr shocks Vers with a Skrull weapon, paralyzing her.] 
[The locals begin screaming before transforming into Skrulls and drawing their weapon. They then charge towards Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char and begin a firefight.]
Yon-Rogg: Vers!
Bron-Char: Incoming!
Yon-Rogg: Back to the Helion!
[The scene changes back to Vers and Soh-Larr. Vers has just regained movement, however, Soh-Larr has transformed into Skrull General Talos.]
Yon-Rogg (through Vers' earpiece): Vers? Do you copy?
Vers: How did you know the code?
General Talos: How about I tell you my secret? When you tell me yours?
[General Talos tasers Vers before the screen turns black.]
Skrull Tech (voiceover): Let's open her up.
[The scene changes to a flashback of Vers at an Airforce base. The camera is pointed towards the nose of a plane and the hangar door is opening. The angle changes to follow Vers walking towards a fighter plane.]
General Talos (voiceover): Where are we?
Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Stand by.
[The angle widens to show a circle of planes sitting on the tarmac.]
Maria: Where's your head at?
Vers: In the clouds. Where's yours?
Maria: On my shoulders. About to show these boys how to do it. You ready?
Vers: Higher, further, faster baby.
Maria: That's right.
[The scene changes to show Maria and Vers climbing into their cockpits and preparing to fly.]
General Talos (voiceover): This can't be right.
[The scene then changes to show Vers and Monica's planes taking off, before switching to a shot of Vers flying.]
General Talos (voiceover): Go back even further.
[The camera spins to change from a scene of Vers flying to a scene of 11-year old Vers driving around a go-kart track at a fair.]
Boy: You're going too fast. You need to go slow.
[Vers speeds up but crashes into the hay outlining the track. As the car tumbles, Vers sees flashes of orange and blue light similar to that of her energy blasts.]
General Talos (voiceover): Who is this person? Are we in the right...?
Joseph Danvers: What the hell are you thinking? You don't belong out here!
Skrull Scientist (voiveover): I think we went back too far.
Vers (11-years old): You let him drive.
Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Let me try something.
[The scene changes again to show Vers hanging onto a rope to complete a ropes course in Air-Force training. She stares at the rope in front of her.]
Cadets: You don't belong out here! You're not strong enough! You'll kill yourself!
[Vers swings back on the rope, before jumping off and trying to grab the rope in front of her. She grabs it, however, she loses grip and falls to the ground. When she hits the ground, there is an image of her thrown backward because of blue and orange flames, before the image returns to her hitting the ground on the course. The cadets laugh behind her]
Drill Instructor: They'll never let you fly.
General Talos (voiceover): Am I the only one who's confused here?
[The scene changes again to the inside of a bar, with Vers sitting at a table with Maria and another pilot standing next to her]
Pilot: You're a decent pilot, but you're too emotional. You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?
[The camera changes to show a pool table. When a ball hits the table, the image changes to a small flash of blue light before changing back to the table]
[The camera then shows Vers' brother and Vers at six lying in the grass]
Vers' Brother: Huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon and the sun and the stars in the sky. And so, little Alouette flew up throughout the night.
Vers (6-years-old): Did you see her? (referring to a shooting star which just passed by) It's Alouette.
[The scene changes again to show a Vers and Maria's daughter lying in the grass outside Maria's house]
Maria: Get your butt's inside, it's time to eat.
Carol: Prepare for takeoff Lieutenant Trouble.
General Talos (voiceover): Charming memory.
Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Hang on. I think I got it.
[The scene changes to show Vers leaning against her car outside of an airplane hanger, with Goose walking towards her. Vers leans down to pet Goose before Dr. Wendy Lawson walks towards her]
Wendy Lawson: Goose likes you. She doesn't typically take to people.
Vers: Early start to your morning.
Wendy Lawson: Ah. Late night actually, I can't sleep when there's work to do. Sound familiar?
Vers: Flying airplanes never feels like work.
[Wendy and Vers turn to look at the airplanes which are taking off and landing]
Wendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?
Vers: I prefer the view from up there.
Wendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough Ace.
[Wendy Lawson turns around and walks away]
General Talos (voiceover): Wait, wait, wait. That's her. Get her back.
Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Stand by.
Wendy Lawson: Sound familiar?
[Vers turns around to see Wendy standing behind her]
Wendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?
Vers: I prefer the view from up there.
Wendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough...
[Wendy Lawson turns around and walks away]
General Talos (voiceover): What's that on her shirt? I couldn't read it.
Wendy Lawson: Sound familiar?
[Vers turns around to see Wendy standing behind her]
Wendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?
Vers: I prefer the view from up there.
Wendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough...
General Talos (voiceover): Focus.
Vers: Excuse me?
[Wendy Lawson talks, however her voice is drowned out by General Talos' voiceover]
General Talos (voiceover): Look down.
[The camera pans down to the nametag on Wendy Lawson's shirt]
General Talos (voiceover): Focus. Pegasus, Dr. Wendy Lawson. That's her.
Carol: Can you hear that?
General Talos (voiceover): Do we have the location?
[The camera shows Vers continuing to talk, but a flash of blue lighting interrupts the scene, before returning to Vers talking to Wendy]
Skrull Tech (voiceover): Got it.
General Talos (voiceover): Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.
[The scene changes back to Vers' dream, where Lawson is holding a gun towards an unknown person]
General Talos (voiceover): Interesting.
[Vers' dream sequence continues through General Talos' voiceovers]
General Talos (voiceover): Huh. Hold on. Go back right before this. Go back.
[Once General Talos fires his weapon, the scene changes to Vers in a dogfight. General Talos continues to talk to Vers, but Vers is beginning to resist]
Carol: That's no MIG, Lawson.
'General Talos (voiceover): This is it. Now, let me see where you're headed. That's right, look at the coordinates. (Vers begins having flashbacks to directly after the explosion) Focus. (Vers shuts here eyes) Open, please. That's it. That's it. (Vers begins looking at the coordinates, but her vision is fuzzy) You're almost there. You're almost there. (Vers shuts her eyes, squeezing them shut) Don't fight it. (Vers visions about the explosion come back, this time focusing on the fire around the plane) Focus!
[Carol ejects herself from the plane, descends down to Earth, and shuts her eyes]
General Talos (voiceover): Get her back. Get her back now!
[When Versopens her eyes, the scene suddenly changes to Vers with electricity running from a machine to her temples. Her vision is blurring, but shadows of upside-down Skrulls can be seen. As Vers looks around, the camera shows her restrained and hanging upside-down inside of a Skrull warship]
Skrull Scientist: This doesn't make any sense.
General Talos: Do we have any information we can act on?
Skrull Scientist: Just that Lawson was somewhere on the Planet C53. We're on our way.
General Talos: Then dig, dig, dig, deeper. Lawson is our link to that lightspeed engine! And everything we're after...
[A Skrull taps Vers in the center of her forehead, which changes an image on a screen]
General Talos: Oh. That did something. Try that again.
[The Skrull taps Vers on the forehead twice, before noticing that Vers' metal restraints are beginning to glow orange]
Skrull: Oh-uh.
[Vers begins free from the restraints and begins to fight the Skrulls, one of the Skrulls raises their weapon, but General Talos lowers it]
General Talos: Not yet!
[Vers fights the Skrulls in the room, before confronting Talos. Vers pushes Talos against a table, and holds a glowing orange restraint against his head]
Vers: What did you do to me?!
General Talos: We're just after a little information.
Vers: What did you put in my head?
General Talos: Nothing that wasn't already there.
Vers: But those aren't my memories.
General Talos: Yeah, its like a bad trip in there. I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight. They really did a number on you.
Vers: Enough of your mind games! What do you want?
General Talos: We're looking for the location of a Doctor Lawson and her light speed engine.
Vers: I don't know any Doctor Lawson.
General Talos: Then why is she in your head?
[Skrulls begin running into the room from all different corridors. Vers throws General Talos against them before running off barefooted. Vers then runs around the ship, trying to find an exit, while fighting of the Skrulls, before she is stuck between two parties of advancing Skrulls]
Vers: You wouldn't know how these things come off would ya? No? Fine.
[Vers begins fighting the Skrulls, with her hands still in the restraints. Once she has defeated the Skrulls, she runs off again before being confronted by General Talos and two others. She presses the pad to open the door with her bare foot. During this fight, she manages to free herself from the restraints by blasting energy from her hands until they break. However, this causes the glass of the ship to crack and Vers to be pulled outside. She then uses the energy in her hands to fly inside towards the room where she was held captive]
Vers: Hey!
[The Skrulls working at the computers put their hands up in surrender, but Vers just picks up her shoes before fighting a Skrull for an escape pod, attracting the attention of Talos]
Talos: Leaving so soon? We're just getting to know each other.
[Vers blasts a wave of energy towards Talos' head, which he ducks underneath. Vers continues starting the pod and flys down to Earth. On the flight down, the pod begins to break, and Vers is forced out and is thrown down into a Blockbuster store]
[The scene changes to the inside of an empty Blockbuster store. The lights are on and hanging at angles, the shelves are half-empty and Vers is covered in material from the roof. Vers stands up slowly and turns in a circle, taking in her surroundings. When she turns around and sees a life-size poster, she shoots an energy blast towards it, causing the head to fall off and the neck to erupt in flames]
Vers: Vers to Star Force Command. Do you read me?
[Vers begins to walk through an aisle, looking at the movies on the shelf]
Vers: Hello? Do you copy?
[Vers stops, picks up a movie and reads the summary. She becomes intrigued with something outside, and walks towards it. The scene then changes to a shopping strip, outside of the Blockbuster. Vers wipes dust off of her shoulders before walking towards a car and knocking on its window]
Vers: Hi, I'm Vers. Kree Star Force. Is this C-53? Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?
Security Officer: Yeah, I understand you.
Vers: Oh, good. Are you in charge of security for this district?
Security Officer: Sort of. The movie theatre has its own guy.
Vers: Where can I find communications equipment?
[The security officer points towards Radio Shack]
Vers: Thank you.
[The scene changes to a shot of Skrulls walking towards the beach from within the waves. They look around, trying to find a person to imitate. General Talos finds a young women surfing, and changes into her]
General Talos: Track the pod, find the girl. She knows more than she knows.
[The scene changes to show that the three Skrulls have also changed into surfers from the beach, however Talos and another are identical]
General Talos: Hey, this one's taken.
[The scene changes back to the shopping strip, now in daylight. Vers is tinkering with her communications equipment with parts from Radio Shack and a payphone. She turns on her communicator and calls Yon-Rogg. The camera switches between Vers at the shopping strip and Yon-Rogg on the ship]
Vers: Come on.
Yon-Rogg: Vers. Verify, CTC39.
Vers: GRX31600, and I'm fine thank you for asking. Is everyone ok, what happened?
Yon-Rogg: Skrull ambush. I thought we'd lost you. Did you find Soh-Larr?
Vers: It wasn't Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him, even knew his code.
Yon-Rogg: That's impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious.
Vers: The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used, I think it was how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.
Yon-Rogg: Vers, where are you?
Vers: I'm on planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.
Yon-Rogg: Who?
Vers: She's... who I see...
Yon-Rogg: She's what? Vers. Vers, what?
Vers: She's a scientist. They think that she's cracked the code on light speed tech. I have to get to her before they do, or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies.
Yon-Rogg: No. You've been caught once already. How far to C-53?
Bron-Char: Closest jump point is 22 hours.
Yon-Rogg: Vers. Hold your position until we get there, keep your comms online so that we can contact you.
Vers: No! What if they get a hold of it before...
[The payphone disconnects. The camera shows Yon-Rogg on the ship]
Yon-Rogg: Vers? Vers!
Korath: If the Skrulls have got to her, she's compromised.
Yon-Rogg: She's stronger than you think.
Bron-Char: Have you visited C-53?
Minn-Erva: Once, it's a real shithole.
[Camera switches back to Vers standing in the phone booth. Police cars speed down the road behind her before turning and parking outside the Blockbuster store. Phill Coulson and Nick Fury step out of an unmarked police car. Coulson walks towards the security car, while Fury begins to examine the store]
Coulson: You call this in?
[The security guard nods before pointing at Vers. Vers is then seen activating her beacon, while Nick Fury walks up behind her and taps on the glass surrounding the phone booth]
Fury: Excuse me miss, do you know anything about a lady who went through the roof of that Blockbuster over there? Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.
Vers: Oh. Yeah, I think she went that way.
[Vers tries to walk off, but Fury steps in front of her]
Fury: Ah. I'd like to ask you some questions. Maybe give you the 4-1-1 on late night drop-bys. Could I see some identification, please?
Vers: Vers. Kree Star Force. We don't carry identification on metal cards.
[Vers tries to walk off again, and Fury stops her]
Fury: Vers. Star Force. How long are you planning on being in town?
Vers: Oh, I'll be out of your hair as soon as I track down the Skrulls which are infiltrating your planet.
Fury: Skrulls?
Vers: Shape-shifters. They can transform into any lifeform down to the DNA. Oh boy, you guys don't have a clue do you?
Fury: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hold on. How do we know that you're not one of those... shapeshifters?
Vers: Congratulations Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question.
Fury: Oh! Congratulations to you Star Force Lady. You're under arrest.
[A policewoman steps forward to arrest Vers, however, Vers sees one of the Skrulls from the beach on a nearby rooftop and shoots an energy blast at them. Vers then runs towards the building, and Fury grabs his gun and runs towards the car. The Skrull runs across the rooftop, jumping over pipes while Fury runs along the footpath at the front of the building. The Skrull runs up the stairs, towards a train and transforms into an old lady who exits the train in front of him. Carol jumps up to the platform and runs into the same old lady. Vers then chases the train down the platform and jumps on top of it. Fury sees Vers hanging onto the train and turns the car around to pursue it. Vers then walks through the train, observing all the passengers]
Stan Lee (1922-2018 R.I.P): [Reading the script for Mallrats] Trust me, true believer. Trust me-
[Vers lowers the script to see the the truest Avenger, who smiles at her. She smiles back, then she continues to looks for the Skrull.]
Stan Lee (1922-2018 R.I.P): [continuing his lines] Trust me, true believer.
[Vers keeps looking before seeing the old lady. Vers then punches her, causing a fight before being pulled off the lady by a group of passengers. The lady escapes before changing into one of the men and walking into the next carriage and jumping onto the roof. Vers follows the man onto the roof and continues to fight him. Fury's car continues to follow the train track, barely avoiding the carnage being thrown off the roof by Vers and the Skrull]
Coulson: Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.
Fury: Let's greet them at the station.
Coulon (over comms): Fury, this is Agent Colson. Umm, I'm still here at the Blockbuster and where did everybody go? I've finished collecting evidence.
[The Skrull disguised as Coulson draws his weapon and points it towards Fury. They struggle for the gun before Fury turns the car into an oncoming bus, killing the Skrull]
[The scene changes to Vers alone outside of a building. She places a Skrull USB into the computer attached to her arm and looks through the file, containing information from her interrogation. The computer shows different images from her interrogation before it sparks and Vers removes the USB. The scene then changes to Vers inside of an internet Cafe, googling the information from the Skrull's. The scene changes again, this time to Vers standing outside of the Cafe holding a map. A biker comes along and parks next to where Vers is standing]
Biker: Nice scuba suit.
[The biker revs his engine, causing Vers to look towards him before looking back at her map]
Biker: Line up honey, heh? Got a smile for me?
[The biker then enters the shop. Vers then looks towards the bike again before taking some clothes from a nearby store and leaving on the bike]
[The scene then changes to the autopsy of the dead Skrull]
Medical Examiner: All life on Earth is carbon-based, not this guy. Whatever he runs on, it's not on the periodic table.
Fury: You're saying he's not from around here?
Medical Examiner: Hey, how's your eye?
Fury: Well, I'd say fine. But it can't believe what it's seeing.
Director: You said, that this thing looked like Coulson?
Fury: Talked like him too.
Director: The woman said that there were more?
Fury: The word she used was infiltration.
Director: Belive her?
Fury: Not 'till I say this.
Director: What's your plan?
Fury: I got to find Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief which fits her description. She can tell us why these lizards are here, maybe she can tell us how to kick them to the curb.
Director: Good. Do it alone though. Can't trust anyone. Not even our own men.
Fury: Yes sir.
[Fury walks away, leaving the Director of SHIELD and the Medical Examiner with the dead Skrull]
Director: Wow, they're ugly bastards aren't they?
Medical Examiner: Yeah, well. They're not Brad Pitt sir.
[The Directors leans down until he's just above the dead Skrull]
Director (whispers): Safe journey to the beyond my friend. I will finish what we started.
Medical Examiner: I wouldn't get too close there boss.
Director: No-one in or out.
[The scene changes to Vers driving the motorcycle across the desert on an almost empty highway. She overtakes a car, then pulls into a parking lot outside of a bar before walking inside. Vers looks around, remembering the vision from the Skrull interrogation of her and Maria inside the bar. The camera pans to show visions of Vers playing an arcade game, drinking with Maria and singing karaoke. Vers then walks over to a wall covered in pictures of Air Force fighter jets, before fixating on one with the Pegasus logo on the tail. While Vers is looking at the photos, the bartender walks past her]
Bartender: What can I get ya?
Vers: Where was this photograph taken?
Bartender: At an airport?
Vers: Where's Pegasus?
Fury: That's classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.
[Vers then walks behind the bartender and into view. The bartender then walks away confused]
Fury: But I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.
Vers:: Did you have a rough day Agent Fury?
Fury: It's cool. You know, space invasion, big car chase, got to watch an alien autopsy. Typical 9 to 5.
Vers: So you saw one?
Fury: I was never one to believe in aliens. But I can't unsee that.
Vers: This is gonna get a little awkward but I gotta ask.
Fury: You think I'm one of those green things.
Vers: Can't be too careful.
Fury: You are looking at 100 percent red-blooded Earthman.
Vers: I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Fury: We talking cheek swab or urine sample.
Carol: No. The DNA would match.
Fury: Well my AOL password.
Vers: Skrulls can only assume recent memories of their host bodies.
Fury: Oh oh! You wanna get personal.
Vers: Where were you born?
Fury: Huntsville, Alabama. But technically I don't remember that part.
Vers:: Name of your first pet.
Fury: Mr. Snuffers.
Vers: Mr. Snuffers?
Fury: That's what I said. Did I pass?
Vers: Not yet. First job?
Fury: Soldier, straight out of high school. Got the ranks of full breed Colonel.
Vers: And then?
Fury: Spy.
Vers: Where?
Fury: It was the Cold War, we were everywhere. Uh... Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest.
Vers: Now?
Fury: Been riding a desk for the past few years, trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occurred to me that they'd be coming from above.
Vers: Name a detail so bizarre a Skrull could never fabricate it.
Fury: If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it. You didn't need that did you?
Vers: No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.
Fury: Ok. Your turn. Prove you're not a Skrull.
[Vers calmly blasts energy out of her fists towards a jukebox on the opposite side of the room before resting her head back on her fist. Fury continues to look towards the jukebox, both concerned and confused]
Fury: And how is that supposed to prove to me that your not a Skrull?
Vers: It's a photon blast.
Fury: And...?
Vers: A Skrull can't do that. So a full-bred colonel turned spy turned SHIELD agent must have pretty high-security clearance. Where's Pegasus?
[The scene changes to a black car driving through an empty highway next to a mountain, before changing to the inside of the car showing Fury driving and Vers in the passenger seat]
Fury: So the Skrulls are alien races which infiltrate and overtake alien planets. And you're a Kree, a race of noble warriors.
Vers: Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.
Fury: So um. What do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?
Vers: They believe she developed a light speed engine at Pegasus.
Fury: Light speed engine? I've got to admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today.
Vers: Well, it's still early.
Fury: And you, what do you want?
Vers: To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.
Fury: And...? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one, you've got a personal stake in this.
[The camera pans out to show the car arriving at a bunker. It then follows the car down the driveway and towards the security checkpoint]
Security Checkpoint: This is a government property, turn your vehicle around.
Fury: Nicholas Joseph Fury, Agent of SHIELD.
Security Checkpoint: Place your thumb on the pad. One moment.
Vers: Nicholas Joseph Fury, you have three names?
Fury: Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick. Just Fury.
Vers: What does your mom call you?
Fury: Fury.
Vers: What do you call her?
Fury: Fury.
Vers: What about your kids?
Fury: If I have them, they'll call me Fury.
Security Checkpoint: You're cleared for access.
Fury: Thank you.
[The gate in front of the bar opens and the car drives down the driveway and into a tunnel. The writing ""Project Pegasus, Joint NASA USAF Facility"" appear on the screen when the car enters the tunnel. Fury continues to drive through the tunnel before reaching the end and parking beside another car. Vers and himself step out of the car and shut the doors]
Fury: Oh, hold up. You look like somebody's disaffected niece. Put that on.
[Fury throws a grey baseball cap with SHIELD's logo at Carol]
Vers: What is this? [gesturing towards the logo]
Fury: It's the SHIELD logo.
Vers: Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job.
Fury: Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.
[Vers puts the cap on, and looks at Fury annoyed]
Fury: Lose the flannel.
[Vers takes off the flannel shirt hanging around her waist and throws it into the car. Vers and Fury then walk over to the edge of the carpark, showing an airplane hanger full of planes set up similar to that in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. A security guard from Pegasus and two armed airmen approach them from behind]
Security: How can I help you?
Fury: We're agents of SHIELD.
[Fury hands his badge to the security officer before looking at Fury]
Vers: We're looking for a woman named Lawson.
Fury: A Dr. Wendy Lawson.
Vers: Do you know her?
[The security officer hands back Fury's badge and directs them]
Security: Follow me.
Vers: Hmm.
[Vers and Fury follow the security officer but are directed towards a holding facility. The scene cuts to Vers and Fury sitting in an office, both incredibly bored. Fury is leaning forward, placing his elbows on his knees while Vers is leaning back against the wall with her arms crossed.]
Fury: Are you familiar with the phrase ""Welcome Wagon""?
Vers: No.
Fury: Well, this ain't it.
[Fury then tries to leave the room by placing his thumb on a scanner near the door. The scanner looks at his fingerprint before blinking red. Fury then sighs before reaching into his pocket to grab his pager]
Vers: Is that a communicator?
[Fury stands up, walk across the room and begins typing on his pager]
Fury: Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.
Vers: Who are you paging?
Fury: My mom. Don't worry, I didn't mention you.
[The text on the pager reads ""DETAINED WITH TARGET. NEED BACKUP""]
[Vers stands up and walks towards the door and tries opening it with her fingerprint, before walking across the room to look at a map of the facility. At the same time, Fury then takes out his badge and looks at it carefully under the lights. He takes a piece of sticky tape, presses it against his badge before walking across the room and placing it on the scanner. When Fury begins walking across the room, Vers sits on the desk and watches him. The scanner reads the fingerprint before glowing green and opening the door]
Fury: After you.
Vers: Impressive.
Fury: Oh. You should see what I can do with a paperclip.
[Vers and Fury walk out of the room. The camera then skips, showing them leaving an elevator on the level holding records. As they are walking towards the records room, Goose walks up to Fury and Vers causing Fury to fawn over the cat]
Fury: Hey, there. How are you?
[Fury leans down to pet Goose but Vers stands back, observing the cat with a sense of deja vu]
Fury: Oh my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you. Aren't you the cutest little thing.
[Fury continues to fawn over the cat, even picking up Goose but Vers continues walking through the corridor looking for the records. Vers eventually finds the room before turning around and watching Fury with disinterest]
Fury: Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh? What's your name? ""Goose"", cool name for a cool cat.
Vers: Fury.
[Both Fury and Goose turn to look at Vers. Vers nods towards the door]
Fury: (to Goose): I'll be back.
[Fury walks away from Goose and stands next to Vers outside a door labeled ""Records""]
Fury: Oh. Let me get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this puppy.
[While Fury is unwrapping the piece of sticky tape, Vers shoots energy out of her fist causing the handle and lock to disappear]
Fury: You sat there and watched me play with tape? When all you had to do was... [Fury imitates Vers shooting the energy]
Vers: I didn't want to steal your thunder.
[Vers and Fury walk into the records room. The room is originally dark, but the lights turn on row by row revealing a massive warehouse of shelves full of boxes. Vers and Fury walk past a few aisles before stopping and turning into one. Vers looks at all the boxes carefully before finding the one she wants]
Vers: Huh. Lawson.
[Vers pulls two boxes off the shelf. She hands the first to Fury and then places the second on the floor before removing files. Randomly, Goose appears at the end of the aisle]
Vers: Ha. Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project.
Fury: Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.
[Fury shows Vers a page from a notebook, covered in hieroglyphics which Vers instantly recognizes]
Vers: Kree glyphs?
Fury: Hmm?
Vers: Lawson is not cuckoo. She's Kree.
Fury: Well, she's dead.
Vers: What?
Fury: She crashed the ASIS aircraft during an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That's why security here's so unfriendly. They're covering up a billion dollar mistake. Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast.
[Fury shows Vers a black and white photograph of a site of the plane crash. The image is a satellite photo of a flat beach next to a mountain, however, the beach has a track leading up to a circle caused by an explosion. Vers turns over the next photo, showing the beach from eye level; the sand was pushed up into large ridges by the explosion]
Vers: When did this crash happen?
Fury: Six years ago. 1989.
Vers: Who was the pilot?
Fury: Um, most of this thing's redacted but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them both alive.
[Fury's pager begins to buzz]
Fury: You OK?
Vers: Mm-hmm.
Fury: Back in a minute.
[Once Fury's gone, Vers reaches into the pile of file's in Fury's box and reads the testimonial and crash report. While she is flipping through the file, she stops at an image of Dr. Lawson, Maria, a pilot and herself in the background]
[A flashback then starts. A fighter jet suddenly takes off from a tarmac. Dr. Lawson speaks to Vers and Maria while the two pilots admire the plane]
Lawson: This isn't about fighting wars. It's about ending them.
[The flashback continues, with Vers attempting to land the new plane but crashing through trees before abruptly finishing]
[The scene then cuts to Vers on the phone with Yon-Rogg]
Vers: I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this?
Yon-Rogg: I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you Vers, but... [looks to see no one is looking] Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core. Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war.
[Scene suddenly changes to show four or five black sedans racing through the entrance tunnel before abruptly pulling up. The director of SHIELD then steps out of the passenger side door of the first car]
Director: Still here?
Fury: She's co-operating with the investigation sir.
Director: You men stay here.
[The director points towards the men in the other cars before himself and Fury walk towards the elevators]
Director: I want to question her alone. Excellent work Nicholas.
[As the Director and Fury step inside the elevator, Fury turns around and looks at the director with a questioning look before the doors close in front of them. The scene then changes back to Vers and Yon-Rogg on the phone]
Vers: Does it say anything about me?
Yon-Rogg: Anything about you? No, of course not. Why would it?
Vers: I found evidence that I had a life here.
Yon-Rogg: On C-53?
Vers: Mar-Vell is who I see in the Supreme Intelligence. I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.
Yon-Rogg: This sounds like Skrull simulation Vers.
Vers: No its not! 'Cause I remember I was here!
Yon-Rogg: Stop! Remember your training. Know your enemy. It could be you. Do not let your emotions undermine your judgment.
[Scene changes back to the elevator with Fury and the Director]
Fury: She's on sub-level 6. I'll get off on 5, take the stairs in case she runs for it. Do a pincer move, like we did in Havana.
Director: Right. Like we did in Havana.
[The elevator buzzes and the doors open. Fury steps off and walks away while the Director stays in the elevator. The scene changes back to Vers and Yon-Rogg]
Yon-Rogg: We're nearing the jump-point. Leave your beacon on so I can find you. We'll get to the bottom of this Vers. Together.
Vers: Ok.
[Vers then hangs up the phone. The scene then changes to show the Director stepping off the elevator on an abandoned level, probably a boiler room. The director looks around confused before the scene changes to show Fury walking through an aisle of cabinets]
Fury: Vers!... Vers!
[The lights turn on at the end of the corrdior, showing a SWAT-like team following the director. Fury quickly jumps into a random aisle. The SWAT team then search through every aisle looking for either Fury or Vers. As this is happening, Vers is seen walking down the stairs towards sub-level 6 with Coulson and another agent on the flight of stairs above her]
Agent: Fury's colluding with the target.
Coulson: Then why did he call us in?
Agent: All I know is that we take him in too. Dead or alive.
Coulson: Dead or alive?
[Vers, standing directly underneath them hears this conversation and, after a moment of contemplation, decides to turn back around and walk up the stairs to find Fury. Fury is then seen hiding at the end of an aisle of cupboards, peeking his head around one side before throwing an empty can across the room. The lights suddenly turn on and a team of agents runs towards the can. Fury then walks through the aisle, before peering his head around. However, when Fury does this, the director points a gun at his head]
Director: Is it something I said?
[Fury hits the gun away from his head, leading to a long struggle between the two men with the Director being victorious]
Director: Now you know, I don't really need these to see (holding up his glasses which were knocked off during the fight). But, they do kinda complete the look (the Director's voice suddenly changes into the voice of Skrull General Talos). Don't you think?
[During this monologue, the Director advances towards Fury, who is lying on his back in defeat. However, an energy blast suddenly appears blasting straight into his chest and sending him flying backward. Several teams of agents suddenly appear standing near the Director, with their guns drawn. But the camera tilts to show a hole burnt through the roof, and Vers and Fury running along a corridor on the level above]
Vers: You called them in?
Fury: My bad!
[Vers and Fury turn a corner, and they are suddenly running up a flight of stairs however, Coulson is standing direclty above them with his gun drawn. Vers' hand lights up but Coulson lowers his weapon before letting both of them walk through the door behind them]
Agent: Coulson, you have eyes on them?
Coulson: They're not down here. Let's try up there.
[Vers and Fury then sprint out of the corridor before barricading the door behind them with a piece of metal. Vers then holds out her hand, expecting Fury to give her something. When he doesn't, she hits him and holds her hand out again]
Fury: What?
Vers: Your communicator. You obviously can't be trusted with it.
[Fury hands over his pager, as the agents slam into the door behind them. The agents are heard struggling, but Vers and Fury run over towards cover. The agents eventually push through, but Vers and Fury are already hidden behind a tower of boxes. Vers then observes her surroundings, looking for a way out before hitting Fury and gesturing towards a plane, which has a striking resemblance to a Star Wars ship. The agents continue to search, even walking past were Vers and Fury were hiding, but the duo are already in the cockpit]
Fury: Do you know how to fly this thing?
Vers: Uh... we'll see.
Fury: That's a yes or no question.
[Vers purposefully plays with a few switches, causing the engine to roar to life and the wings to extend]
Vers: Yes.
[The Director hears the engine come to life and turns around to see the plane alive. Vers then pushes a lever forward and causes the plane to lift]
Fury: That's what I'm talking about!
[The Director and the agents shoot meaninglessly at the plane, but the plane continues to lift off and fly normally. Vers flies the plane out of the underground tarmac area, and over the open desert before the plane begins gaining altitude quickly. Suddenly, a meowing sound can be heard from the back of the plane. Both Vers and Fury turn to see Goose pushed against a crate]
Fury: We've got a stowaway.
Vers: Hang on Goose.
[Vers then stops the plane from gaining altitude and Goose pushes himself off the crate, onto his four legs. Goose then happily walks up to the cockpit before trying to climb into Vers' lap. Vers pick him up and places him on the console before Goose lies down]
Fury: Who's a good kitty huh? Huh Goose? Yes, that's right. Who's a good kitty Goose? You're a good kitty.
[Goose responds to Fury by lying down comfortably and staring at him]
Vers: See anyone you know? Funny story... I arrived on Hala, near dead, no memory... That was six years ago.
Fury: So you think you're the pilot that went down with Dr Lawson.
Vers: I'm saying that the last person to see them alive can probably tell us.
Fury: Maria Rambeau.
Carol: Mmhmm. So how do we get to Louisianna?
Fury: Due East. Hang a right at Memphis.
Vers: That agent, that stopped the Skrulls from fighting us...
Fury: Coulson. New guy. Guess he doesn't hate me yet.
Vers: Yeah well, give him time.
Fury: I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It's a really hard thing to do. That's what keeps us human.
Vers: I get in trouble for that. A lot.
Fury: I see that about you (Vers and Fury laugh about this). Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that's not standard Kree operating procedure.
Vers: Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.
[The scene then changes to the Kree ship approaching a jump-point. Yon-Rogg is seen walking towards the holograph, which is later shown the be Ronan the Accusor]
Yon-Rogg: Ronan.
Ronan: The Accusors have completed their operation but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team.
Yon-Rogg: It was a trap. To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper.
Ronan: Give us the location, we'll take care of the terrorist threat.
Yon-Rogg: By bombing them out of the galaxy. No. We'll handle this.
Ronan: Several Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they?
Korath: They are...
Yon-Rogg: Lost. They are lost, for now. But we will find them.
Ronan: Do so, or we will.
[Ronan disappear, leaving only Yon-Rogg and Korath]
Yon-Rogg: Maintain the course for C-53.
[The scene changes to show a traditional suburban house behind a forest of trees. On closer inspection, Maria Rambo is tinkering on a workstation beside a small two-seater plane. Vers approaches Maria carefully, almost unsure of what to say or do. Once Vers speaks, Monica Rambeau quickly exits the plane she was exploring]
Vers: Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.
Monica: Aunty Carol? Mom, it's Aunty Carol! I knew it, everybody said you were dead but we knew they were lying.
[Monica jumps off the plane and runs to Vers to hug her. Vers stands awkwardly, unaware of how the child is]
Vers: I'm not really who you think I am.
[The scene changes to the inside of the house. Maria and Monica are sitting at a small dining table, Vers is leaning against the counter and Fury is leaning against the wall]
Maria: That is the craziest shit I have ever heard.
Monica: Green-transforming aliens? There's no such thing.
Fury: You're absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. 'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves. (Fury looks towards Vers accusingly)
Vers: You don't believe me.
[Vers stand up and walks towards the stove, where a pot of unboiled water sits on the stove. She stands next to the stove, with one hand on the kettle and begins heating it up, her hand glowing blue and orange. When this starts, Monica stands up, both fascinated and curious, and walks over to the stove. Quickly, the kettle begins to boil, blowing steam out and making a whistling noise]
Monica: No way. That's so cool.
Fury: Oh, ho. She can do a lot more than just make tea with those hands.
Monica: Like what? Show us.
'Vers:' Maybe later.
Monica: I kept all your stuff, I'll go get it.
Vers (to Fury): You want to give her a hand with that?
Fury: Mmm??
[Fury then follows Monica off-screen, leaving Vers alone with Maria, who hasn't said a word since the incident with the kettle. Vers walks from behind the counter and sits opposite Maria at the table]
Maria: You don't remember anything?
Vers: I see... flashes. Little moments, but I can't tell what's real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning, maybe it'll all make sense?
Maria: You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early, the Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat, so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn't about to argue, 'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut.
Vers: Since when is a shortcut cheating?
Maria: Since it violates the pre-determined rules of engagement.
Vers: I definitely don't remember those.
Maria: Mmm, of course you don't. (both Maria and Vers laugh for a bit) When I got to the hanger, Lawson was agitated, she said 'she had lives to save'. She was trying to take the Aces up herself, but you said...
Vers: 'If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.'
Maria: Yup. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we've both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That's why I liked her. But, now you're saying she's from another planet.
Vers: I know this must be hard for you.
Maria: What, this part right here? No, no. Know what's hard? Losing my best friend, in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... with your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don't even know what... 'Vers'? Is that really who you are now?
Vers: I don't know.
Monica: Come look.
[Monica has brought a box of Vers' things onto the dining table in an adjacent room. Fury looks through a few photos before putting them back and stepping away from the table. Vers walks into the room and stands behind Monica, who is showing her a photo]
Monica: This is me and you on Halloween.
[Monica shows Vers a photo of a young Monica dressed as a pilot sitting next to Vers]
Monica: I'm Amelia Earhart and you're Janis Joplin. Oh, this is you when you were little, you didn't get along with your parents so Mom said we became your real family.
[Monica shows Vers a photo of a young Vers standing next to her father]
Monica: This is us on Christmas. I got more...
[Monica shows Vers photo after photo, starting with Monica, Vers and Maria sitting in front of a Christmas tree, then a photo of young Vers dressed as a pilot, then a photo of Vers sitting in a bar]
Monica: Here's another picture of when you were little. And this is how you right after you graduated... (Monica continues to talk, but the words start to mix together).
[The camera pans over all the photos which Monica has shown and is showing to Vers. In addition to the other photos, there is one of her Air Force graduation, one of her squadron standing in front of a plane, one of her and Monica carving a pumpkin and another of Vers dressed as Janis Joplin]
Monica: Oh wait. I forgot, your jacket. Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it.
[Monica runs off to retrieve Vers' jacket. Once Monica has left, Vers looks at the pictures again, pushing them around to better see ones underneath. Vers continues looking through the pictures before she comes across her old dog tag, which has been burnt]
Maria: That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought.
[The door knocks, and Maria moves forward to answer the door]
Vers: Don't answer that.
Maria: It's just my neighbor.
Vers: They can change into anyone.
[Fury and Vers walk towards the door and try to see who is outside. Vers answers the door and stares unfriendly at Maria's neighbor, Tom]
Tom: Hi there.
Vers: What do you want?
Tom: Ummm...
Maria: Hey Tom. This is my friend Carol.
Tom: Pleased to meet you. Yow! Static electricity out here's no joke. I noted that peculiar bird you got parked by the road, and I was just wondering if you'd mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie?
Vers: A closer looksie?
Tom: Yeah.
Vers: To see the bird parked out by the road. You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you Talos?
Maria: I'm sorry. Tom, this isn't really a good time. I'll come by tomorrow? Okay?
Tom: Uhh...
Maria: Okay.
[Maria closes the door, but Vers continues to stare at Tom. Once Maria has closed the door, a voice is heard behind them. Fury draws his weapon and aims it towards the voice, Vers' hands light up and Maria stands there confused]
Talos: You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.
[Talos takes a sip of the milkshake he is holding while Carol begins to advance towards him, her hands glowing more now]
Talos: Now, hang on a second, before you go swinging those jazz hands around, making a mess in your friend's house - and... it's a lovely home.
Maria: Oh my God. What the hell?
[Maria is staring out the window, looking at herself playing with Monica]
Talos: No one's gonna hurt the girl. Just, don't kill me. That would really complicate the situation.
Fury: I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.
Talos: I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. Without deception.
Vers: And who is that, out there?
Talos: Okay, that's a fair point. But I'm sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk.
Vers: Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles.
Talos: That was before I knew who you were. Before I found what made you different from the others. I have an audio recording from Pegasus, of your voice, from a plane crash six years ago. On a device I believe you call a 'black box'.
Maria: They told me it was destroyed in the crash. How'd you get it?
Talos: Does she not understand? Young lady I have a special skill that kinda allows me to get into places I'm not supposed to be.
Maria: Call me young lady again, and I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.
Talos: Am I supposed to guess where that is?
Fury and Maria: Your ass.
Talos: Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here. But look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you sit down, you listen to this, I assure you, it'll be worth your while.
Carol: Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.
Talos: Deal.
[Goose walks onto the scene and begins pressing himself against Talos' legs. Talos, surprised jumps backwards]
Talos: Oh my God! Get that thing away! How'd that get in here?
[Vers picks up Goose, and holds him out towards Talos. Carol walks towards Talos, with her arms still extended, causing Talos to walk backwards]
Vers: The cat? This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?
Talos: That's not a cat. That's a Flerken.
Fury: A Flerken? (Fury laughs)
[Monica walks into the house and sees Maria standing next to Carol and Fury. She looks around and sees the Skrull assuming its true form]
Monica: Mom?
[The scene changes to the outside of a barn, with Monica sitting outside on the bench and Maria trying to stop her from coming inside]
Monica: Why can't I listen to?
[Monica puts earplugs in her ears and Maria walks inside, revealing a study. Vers, Fury, and Talos are already inside, waiting for Maria to play the tape. Maria puts the CD in the computer tower and the computer begins loading the tape. A loading bar appears on the screen, with the bar moving slowly across the screen]
Vers: What's happening?
Fury: It's loading.
[The camera cuts back to the screen, with the tape almost loaded]
Lawson (audio): Punch in the coordinates. 5229, -47, 8.768, 0.2.
Vers (audio): Copy that. Where are we going Doc?
Lawson (audio): My laboratory.
Vers (audio): Your laboratory? What do you mean?
Lawson (audio): Oh no.
Vers (audio): Is that... Wait, what is that? It's not showing up on my radar.
Lawson (audio): Go Carol. Fly!
[Scene changes to a flashback of the inside the airplane, with Vers in the cockpit and Lawson directly behind her. Outside the window, Earth can be seen with other planes flying around it]
Vers: That's no MIG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?
Lawson: Those are the bad guys. Fly faster, now.
Vers: Yes, ma'am. (Vers pushes a lever forward, causing the plane to speed up. The plane following them als also speeds up to catch them. The dogfight between the two planes continue, with Vers pushing the lever sideways in an effort to escape the other plane) What do they want?
Lawson: Me. My work. I never should have brought you along.
Vers: Here come some G's. (Vers pulls the lever backwards, causing the plane to flip in the air. After the flip, Vers and Lawson are trailing the other plane. However, when Vers fires the other plane fires back). They're firing backward. Hold on! (Vers pushes the lever sideways and the plane tilts into another revolution. However, the plane is hit and the wing bursts into flames. Vers struggles to regain control of the plane, but fails to do so]
Vers: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out! Stay with me Lawson! (Vers ejects the cockpit from the plane, and struggles to regain control. Once Vers has aligned the plane parallel to the ground, the plane crashes into a beach)
Maria: Danvers, do you copy?
Vers: Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.
Maria: Can anyone hear me?
Vers: Yeah. I copy! Doc?
[Vers climbs out of the plane and attends to Lawson, whose head is slumped against her chest. Once Vers removes Lawson's helmet, she notices something is wrong]
Vers: Your blood... it's blue.
Lawson: Yeah, but, uh...how's my hair? Help me out.
[Vers unbuckles Lawson's seatbelt and helps her out of the plane]
Lawson: I have to destroy it before they get here.
[Vers helps Lawson walk a few steps away from the plane before Lawson falls over. Vers leans over Lawson and tries to help her stand up, but Lawson refuses]
Vers: What? Lawson?
Lawson: You remember what I said about our work here? What it's for?
'Vers:' To end wars?
Lawson: Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name, is Mar-Vell and I come from a planet called Hala.
Vers: I would say that your delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue.
Lawson: Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, okay? You've got to save them without me.
Vers: Save who? How?
[Lawson ignores Vers' questions and pulls a gun out of her jacket]
Lawson: I've got to blow this engine before they find it.
[Lawson sits up and attempts to shoot the plane, but she is shot through the heart by an attacker from the other ship. Vers watches Lawson fall and sits there in shot watching the assailant. Suddenly, Vers reaches for Lawson's gun and points in the direction of the attacker. Vers switches between looking at Lawson lying on the ground and the direction of the attacker. Eventually, Yon-Rogg appears walking towards Vers and Lawson. Vers, with her gun drawn, slowly walks towards the plane]
Yon-Rogg: We have no interest in hurting you.
Vers: No?! Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!
Yon-Rogg: The energy core, where is it?
Vers: Pararescue's on the way. You have two minutes until you're surrounded.
Yon-Rogg: Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.
[Yon-Rogg draws his gun and points it towards Vers]
Vers: No wait. (Vers gestures towards the engine of the plane) You mean that energy core?
[Both Vers and Yon-Rogg look at the engine of the plane. Vers then turns her weapon towards the engine and fires. Immediately, the engine bursts into blue and orange flames, causing Vers and Yon-Rogg to be thrown backward. Vers absorbs the energy, with the flames creating ripples around her. All around the crash site, rocks are turned into dust and trees disintigrate. Vers continues to absorb the energy, her hands begin to spark and her eyes glow bright blue. Shortly afterwards, the blast suddenly stops and Carol is thrown backward onto the ground, with her body still sparking. Yon-Rogg struggles to stand up, and watches Vers from his seated position. Yon-Rogg's team heard the noise and have suddenly appeared]
Minn-Erva: Commander, she's still moving. Permission to fire?
Yon-Rogg: Hold your fire.
[Yon-Rogg walks up to the still-sparking Vers]
Minn-Erva: There's nothing left. The core has been destroyed.
[Yon-Rogg continues looking at Vers, but notices a part of her dog-tag sitting in the dirt. He picks it up and sees ""Vers"" inscribed on it]
Yon-Rogg: She absorbed its power. She's coming with us.
[The scene suddenly changes back into the present day, outside of the study. Vers is walking outside, confused]
Vers: He lied to me.
[Maria, Fury, and Talos follow her outside slowly]
Vers: Everything that I knew was a lie.
Talos: Now you understand.
Vers: What? What do I understand now?
Talos: Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her. Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.
Vers: No. Your people are terrorists... that kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa.
Talos: Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for. My people lived as refugees on Torfa. Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule and they destroyed our planet. Now the handful of us that are left, will be slaughtered next...unless you will help me finish what Mar-Vell started. The coordinates you found, would've powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety. A new home, where the Kree can't reach us.
Maria: Lawson always told us that her work at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars, but to end them.
Talos: She wanted you to help us find the core.
Vers: Well, I already destroyed it.
Talos: No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates, we can find it.
Vers: You'll use it to destroy us.
Talos: We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can't you see it now? You're not one of them.
Vers: You don't know me. You have no idea who I am. I don't even know who I am!
Maria: You are Carol Danvers. You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend... who supported me as a mother, and a pilot when no one else did. You're smart and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. And you are the most powerful person I knew, way before you could shoot fire from your fist. You hear me? You hear me?
[The scene changes back to the inside of the barn, with Talos, a Skrull scientist, Fury, Carol and Maria standing around a table]
Talos: I know I don't deserve your trust but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell's core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.
Carol: Those weren't coordinates. They're safe vectors.
Fury: Orbital positioning and velocity.
Maria: You didn't find her lab on Earth, because it's not on Earth.
Carol: That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we'll find it, in orbit, right now.
Maria: It's just basic physics.
Talos: In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you're my science guy, right?
[The Skrull scientists nods then looks down briefly, disappointed in himself]
Carol: Yon-Rogg will catch up to you soon. We've got to get the core before he does.
Fury (while eating a sandwich): Mmm. You're going to space?
Carol: In what?
Skrull Scientist: A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications.
Fury: Hmm. Your science guy.
[The scene changes to the inside of the hanger, with Talos and the Skrull scientist modifying the plane which Carol and Fury flew. The scene then changes back to the inside of the house, with Carol and Maria sitting opposite each other at a table]
Carol: Well, I could use a co-pilot.
Maria: No. No, I... I can't. I can't leave Monica.
Monica: Why? It's okay. I can stay with grandma and pop-pop.
Maria: There's no way I'm going baby. It's too dangerous.
Monica: Testing brand new aerospace tech is dangerous. Didn't you used to do that?
[Carol looks at Maria, smiling smuggly]
Maria: Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey, and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy. Correct?
[Carol smiles and shrugs her shoulders.]
Monica: That's what I'm saying. You have to go.
Maria: Monica...
Monica: You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think that you should consider the kind of example you're setting for your daughter.
[Maria looks towards Carol for help, but Carol is laughing at Maria's position. Carol then gives Monica a thumbs up]
[The scene then changes to the outside of the house, with Maria walking towards a car, with her parents inside. Monica sits on the front step watching the encounter. Carol then walks outside with her Kree suit on and sits beside Monica]
Carol: Your Mom's lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble.
Monica: You remember.
Carol: Is that mine? (Carol looks at the jacket sitting in Monica's lap. However, Carol protests when Monica attempts to hand it over). No, no. You hang onto it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can't wear these Kree colors anymore, and since you're obviously the only person around here with any sense of style...
[Carol stands up and presses a few buttons on her suit. Carol holds her arm out to Monica, allowing her to change the colors. She replaces the green with bright red and the yellow replacing the grey stripes]
Monica: No.
[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to orange, blue and yellow]
Monica: Uh-uh.
[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to black with neon lights lining the stripes]
Monica: Definitely not. (Both Carol and Monica laugh)
[Monica changes the color again, this time to a white suit with green stripes]
Carol: Well, since we're on the same team...
[Carol gestures to Monica's red, yellow and blue shirt. Monica then changes the colors to match her shirt. Carol's suit changes to a blue suit with yellow stripes and red gloves, boots, belt and shoulders]
Carol: How do I look?
Monica: Fresh.
[The scene then changes to a path surrounded by grass. Almost immediately, Yon-Rogg steps onto the path and walks down it. He walks down the path and into a small house in the middle of the forest. Carol, in her Kree colors, is already standing inside and watches him enter]
Carol: What took you so long?
Yon-Rogg: I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
Carol: PRY46-B...
Yon-Rogg: No, no codes. That system is fallible, as we've learned.
Carol: Okay, then let's do this.
Yon-Rogg: Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?
Carol: The person you most admire and respect, I guess. But you would never tell me who.
Yon-Rogg: And what is your earliest memory of Hala?
Carol: The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins.
Yon-Rogg: Whose blood?
Carol: (Carol looks sideways, confused and stumbed) Hmm.
[Yon-Rogg shoots Carol, causing her to fly backward. Yon-Rogg then walks up to her and points his gun at her face]
Yon-Rogg: That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.
[Carol suddenly turns into a Skrull]
Yon-Rogg: What have you done with her?
Skrull: You're too late.
[Yon-Rogg begins walking away before stopping and turning around]
Yon-Rogg: She knows?
[Before the Skrull can answer, Yon-Rogg shoots him. He puts his gun back in its holster before calling Ronan with the hologram in his arm]
Yon-Rogg: Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once.
Ronan: For the good of all Kree, Commander the infestation will be eradicated.
[The scene changes to the modified spaceship flying above the clouds before cutting to show Carol and Maria flying. The camera pans out to show Fury petting Goose and Talos looking at him uncomfortably]
Carol: Passing 500 and climbing.
Talos: You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.
Fury: Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out (Fury picks up Goose and shoves him towards Talos' face. Talos jerks backward in his seat) like that, yeah I'm gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs, right?
Maria: Can I ask you something? Do you just turn into anything you want?
Talos: Ah well, I have to see it first.
Maria: Can you all do it?
Talos: Physiologically, yeah. But it takes practice and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.
Fury: Can you turn into a cat?
Talos: What's a cat?
Maria: What about a filing cabinet?
Talos: Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?
Fury: A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap.
(Talos sighs, annoyed at Fury's jokes)
Carol: Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks.
[Carol pushes down a lever, causing the plane to suddenly climb further into the sky. In the plane, everybody is pushed back into their seats]
Fury: Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?
Carol: Pretty much.
[Carol smiles at Fury's question, while Talos just looks towards him and shakes his head. The plane continues to fly directly upwards, inside the plane everything begins floating. Carol and Maria's hair begins floating along with a few pens from the console between their seats. Similarly, Goose is floating upside down until Fury extends his arm, which Goose eagerly grabs onto. Maria then flicks a switch and gravity suddenly turns on inside the plane, and everything returns to normal]
Carol: Locking in coordinate grid.
Maria: Where is it?
[The view switches to the outside of the ship, showing the ship sitting in empty space with Earth below it]
Talos: It's here. It's gotta be here.
Fury: Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?
[Carol realizes something and pulls out the computer in her arm. After a few swipes, the computer lights up]
Computer: Decloaking activated.
[Suddenly, a bright light appears from the empty space and a massive laboratory becomes visible. The title ""Mar-Vell's Laboratory, Kree Imperial Cruiser"" appears on the screen. Carol flies the spaceship into the laboratory and the four disembark the plane and begin walking through the corridors]
[The four walk into a giant room, with the Tesseract sitting in the reactor on one side of the room. Goose jumps onto the reactor and scratches the Tesseract, intrigued by the bright light. Carol and Maria follow behind him]
Maria: Is that it? The core?
Carol: In her notes, she called it the Tesseract.
[Carol reaches out and grabs the Tesseract from its position in the reactor. She then throws it in the air like a baseball and walks around the room, beginning to observe her surroundings]
Maria: Whoa. What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?
[Maria picks up and lunchbox and opens it. Carol then places the Tesseract inside before closing the box. Fury then coughs and gestures towards a cup of tea, which is still steaming]
Maria: We're not alone.
[Talos begins singing loudly. Suddenly, a swarm of scared Skrulls appear from their hiding places. Suddenly a Skrull runs towards Talos and hugs himi]
Soren: Talos!
Carol: He didn't come here for the Tesseract.
[Soren calls a child to come towards her and Talos. The child comes willingly, and Talos leans down to get a better look at him]
Soren: It's okay. We didn't know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the Kree would find us.
Talos: You did the right thing.
[Once Soren noticed that Carol, Maria, and Fury are standing in the room, she tries to back away but Talos stops her]
Talos: It's okay, it's okay. She's alright. She's a friend.
Carol: I'm not gonna hurt you.
Talos: She led me to you.
Carol: I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
Talos: Carol, this is war. My hands are filthy from it too. But we're here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There's thousands of us separated from each other... scattered throughout the galaxy.
[Talos' daughter walks over to Carol, holds her hand and directs her towards the pinball machine in the corner. When they get there, the child points to the high score in glowing lights. The child jumps excitedly and asks her to play]
Fury: If I played the same pinball machine for six years I'd have some high scores too.
[Suddenly the doors to the lab open, and Yon-Rogg and his team walk through]
Yon-Rogg: Fraternizing with the enemy?
[Fury draws his gun but Minn-Erva already has hers pointed directly towards him. When she gestures for him to drop it, he raises his hands in surrender and returns the gun to its holster. Yon-Rogg walks towards Carol and throws Goose along the floor towards her. When the camera pans, Talos has positioned Soren behind her, Fury and Maria are both unarmed and the Kree's have surrounded the four]
Yon-Rogg: What did you do to your uniform?
Minn-Erva: They got in her head. Just like we thought.
Korath: The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.
Talos: You can see they're not soldiers, let them go. You can have me.
Yon-Rogg: And the core?
Carol: You lied to me.
Yon-Rogg: I made you a better version of yourself. What's given can be taken away.
[Carol tries to light up her fists but they just spark uselessly before eventually dying out. The chip in her neck has also turned off. Instead of using her powers, Carol runs towards Yon-Rog and begins punching him. This results in a fist fight between the two. Quickly, Yon-Rogg lights up a gadget in his suit. The gadget glowed bright blue and caused Carol to lean back in an attempt to avoid it. Around her, the Kree are attacking the Skrulls, forcing them to kneel. Yon-Rogg then jerks his arm away from Carol, causing her to fall onto the ground]
[When Carol wakes up, the Supreme Intelligence machine is attached to her. She is kneeling with her hands bound in front of her. When Carol meets the Supreme Intelligence, a record is playing beside her and a long table is sitting in front of her, a few meters away with Dr. Lawson sitting at the only seat]
Supreme Intelligence: There she is. Seems like you time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket? It's killer by the way.
[The Supreme Intelligence stands up and begins dancing to the music]
Supreme Intelligence: The music, it's a nice touch.
Carol: Let... me... out.
Supreme Intelligence: No can do.
Carol: If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.
Supreme Intelligence: With what exactly? Your powers came from us.
Carol: You didn't give me these powers. The blast did.
Supreme Intelligence: And yet, you've never had the strength to control them on your own.
[Carol tries to blast the Supreme Intelligence with her energy blast, but when she tries the Supreme Intelligence snaps her fingers and the energy dissapears, replaced with searing pain in Carol's neck which causes Carol to double over in pain]
[The scene switches back to the spaceship. The Kree are still surrounding the Skrulls, and Goose is being scanned with a Kree scanner]
Scanner: Species: Flerken. Threat: High.
[Bron-Char begins putting a muzzle on Goose's head, but is met by protests from Fury]
Fury: It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.
Scanner: Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none.
Fury: That thing is clearly busted.
Minn-Erva: Load the Flerken onto the heli. Eject the others into space.
[The scene switches back to inside the Supreme Intelligence. Carol has just finished standing up after the pain in her neck]
Supreme Intelligence: You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more.
Carol: I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You're talking about destroying them because they won't submit to your rule. And neither will I.
Supreme Intelligence: We found you. We embraced you as our own.
Carol: You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends.
[Carol runs forward and jumps to punch Lawson, however, her hand travels right through Lawson's skull. Lawson then throws Carol into a wall, leaving Carol hanging sideways]
Supreme Intelligence: It's cute how hard you try. Remember... without us...you're weak. (Carol pushes herself behind the wall, and sees a screen of her younger memories on Earth playing) You're flawed. Helpless. We saved you.
[The screen of Carol's failures continues to play, until she suddenly drops, falling into nothingness until suddenly landing on the floor]
Supreme Intelligence: Without us... you're only human.
Carol: You're right. I'm only human.
[Suddenly a montage plays, of Carol standing up everytime after her failures]
Supreme Intelligence: On Hala, you were reborn. Vers.
Carol: My name... is Carol.
[Carol lights up her fist, but Lawson blasts energy towards her first. Lawson's energy surrounds Carol, but Carol manages to walk towards Lawson. On the spaceship, Carol's hands begin to light up and begin burning the machine]
Korath: She's trying to break out.
[Carol continues to release energy waves from her hands. This causes all electricity on the ship to malfunction. Goose's cage comes loose, the prisoner's handcuffs suddenly pop open and the cage full of Skrulls is opened]
Carol: I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens... (Carol pulls out the chip attached to her neck, causing the energy from her fists to spread to cover her entire body) ...when I'm finally set free?
[Carol drops the chip before flashing back to her absorbing the energy from the explosion before flashing back to the present day where the chip explodes off her neck like a bullet and she is released from the Supreme Intelligence, glowing and floating in the air. She suddenly blasts energy from her hands, and sends four Kree flying backward in to the wall behind them. She grabs the lunchbox with the Tesseract and finds Maria and Fury]
Fury: You know you're glowing, right?
Carol: I'll explain it later. (Carol opens the lunchbox to reveal the Tesseract glowing inside) Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox.
Fury: (Fury has just unbuckled Goose's collar and is now holding her) Me?
Carol: Yes.
Fury: I'm not touching that thing.
Carol: Want me to get you an oven mitt?
[Goose suddenly lurches himself out of Fury's arms and giant tentacles emerge from inside Goose's mouth. Goose picks up the Tesseract from the lunchbox and swallows it whole before returning back to a normal cat. Fury quickly drops Goose in surprise]
Carol: Get the Skrulls in the QuadJet and go. Take the Flerken with you.
Maria: What about you?
Carol: I'll buy you some time!
Fury: I'm picking you up now. I'm trusting you not to eat me.
[Carol is then seen sitting on the railing of an overhead corrider. She holds up the lunchbox in front of her before jumping over the railing once she has the Kree's attention]
Carol: Hey Guys. Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract.
Yon-Rogg: I used to find you amusing. Let's put an end to this!
[The Kree all draw their weapon and begin to advance on her. Carol simply blasts her energy down the overpass, causing the metal to snap and four Kree to be incapacitated. Carol then proceeds to take on the Kree, attacking them individually. Each fight only lasts a few seconds, but always results in Carol dominating]
[Maria picks up a gun and fires until Goose opens his mouth and the tentacles take the kree soldiers, beat them up and swallowed them]
Maria: Okay.
Fury: Good kitty.
Carol: You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out?
Minn-Erva: No. I just never liked you.
[The scene changes to Fury and Maria running through a corridor on the ship. Suddenly, a group of Kree appears behind them]
Kree: Hey! In a hurry?
[Scene changes back to the fight between Yon-Rogg and Carol. Yon-Rogg is standing above Carol, about to attack her]
Att-Lass: Don't make me do this.
Carol: Okay.
[Carol then blasts some energy, causing her to fly upwards and Yon-Rogg to fly backward towards a wall]
Fury: Now! Come on! Do your thing. Come on! Dammit, Goose. Pick a side.
Kree: Take them to the hangar too. We'll blast them all into space.
Talos: Play it cool. Just like Havana. Do you have the thing?
Fury: Flerken kitty ate it.
Kree: Come on. Move. Move!
Talos: Follow my lead. Cover her eyes. (to Soren)
[Talos then shoots the four guards escorting the Skrulls onto the ship, causing a distraction]
Talos: Get on the ship. Let's go, let's go.
[The fighting between Yon-Rogg and Carol continues. Eventually, Yon-Rogg pins Carol to the wall with a mountain of metal from the walkway. He then opens the lunchbox to find a soup container sitting inside]
Yon-Rogg: Nice diversion.
Carol: I could've swore, I put it in there.
[The fighting between Carol and Yon-Rogg restarts with Yon-Rogg throwing loose pieces of metal at Carol telepathically. Carol quickly escapes and runs towards the energy source. However, the Kree found the Skrulls had begun escaping and ran towards the hanger, shooting randomly at the ship. One of these bullets hits Talos, causing him to fall over in pain. Maria Rambeau starts the ship and leaves the Laboratory with the Skrulls and Nick Fury.]
Yon-Rogg: Minn-Erva, take them down on a dropship.
Minn-Erva: On it.
[Scene changes to the spaceship piloted by Maria]
Fury: You all right, friend?
Talos: Never... better.
Maria: We've got a bogey. Coming in hot.
[Minn-Erva follows the Skrulls down to Earth in a space pod. Yon-Rogg enters a pod, too, just as Carol catches up with him. She lights up her fists, preparing to fire, but Yon-Rogg drops the ship, catching her by surprise. She activates her helmet and holds onto the pod tightly. Meanwhile, Minn-Erva starts shooting at the Quadjet and Maria barely dodges the bullets while flying through the desert. Carol attempts to shoot Yon-Rogg again, but she is sent backwards by his magnitron device. She falls down to Earth, but she manages to calm and control her powers right before hitting the ground, which allows her to fly back up. Meanwhile Minn-Erva continues to chase down the Skrulls, as the two spaceships enter a canyon. Maria evades the bullets with ease and takes a shortcut, allowing her to be in front of Minn-Erva's pod and destroy it with blasts.]
Fury: Ha ha!
Maria: Yes! Boom!
[Yon-Rogg attacks the Quadjet, but Carol hits his pod in her flight]
Fury: What the hell was that?
[Due to the damage taken, Yon-Rogg's pod crashes into the desert. At the same time, the Accusers arrive outside Earth's atmosphere.]
Ronan: Deploy ballistic warheads.
[All spaceships launch the missiles towards Earth. Carol manages to catch one with her hands and, using her newly discovered power, throws it back, causing it to explode. The explosion destroys the rest of the warheads, while Carol flies right through the fire towards the spaceships.]
Accuser: That's impossible.
Ronan: C-53 doesn't have a defense system advanced enough to destroy our warheads.
Accuser: That's not their defense system, Ronan.
Ronan: Take her down.
[The spaceships deploy several drones which start shooting at Carol. She avoids most of them and absorbs the energy of the blasts that hit her. She then proceeds to destroy all the drones and one of the Accusers' spaceships, before flying in front of Ronan, showing her full power.]
Ronan: Return to the jump point. We'll be back for the weapon.
Accuser: The core?
Ronan: The woman.
[The Kree retreat, and Carol returns to Earth, where she confronts Yon-Rogg]
Yon-Rogg: I'm so proud of you. You've come a long way since I found you that day by the lake. But can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on? Or will it get the better of you, as always? I always told you... you'll be ready, the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment. This is that moment, Vers! Turn off the light show, and prove, prove to me, you can beat me without...
[Carol shoots Yon-Rogg with a small blast, which sends him flying backwards and hits a rock. She then walks towards him, while he tries to crawl back.]
Carol: I have nothing to prove to you.
[Carol reaches her hand out to Yon-Rogg and he takes it. She drags him across the desert, and puts him in the Kree pod in which he crashed. Carol enters coordinates on the computer.]
Computer: Destination: Hala.
Yon-Rogg: I can't go back empty-handed.
Carol: You won't be empty-handed. I'm sending you with a message. Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it. The war, the lies, all of it.
Yon-Rogg: You can't do this.
[Carol starts the spacepod, but it can't take off beacause of the damage. She fires a blast at the engine, and the spacepod finally takes off.]
[Scene changes to Nick Fury holding Goose inside the Quadjet]
Fury: That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? The bad guy's still in there somewhere- [Goose scratches Nick Fury's eye] Oh! MOTHER FLERKEN!!!
Maria: You okay?
Fury: Yeah. It's just a scratch. [a serious scratch is shown on his left eye]
Talos: No...
[Scene changes to Maria's house, where everyone gathered for dinner]
Carol: I can't believe you got into the raddest dogfight ever.
Maria: I'd say you arrived just in time.
Fury: That's some nifty flying you did out there. SHIELD could always use a good pilot like you.
Maria: I'll consider it. As long as you don't call my flying nifty again. How's your eye?
Fury: Getting better every second.
Carol: Just so I'm clear, you were Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?
Fury: Keller. Tied my boss up, stole his identity.
Talos: I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.
Soren: It's a little like thief.
Talos: Whose side are you on?
Fury: You're good to go here til you recover, but you and your family will need a new look.
Talos: I could go back to being your boss.
Fury: Please don't.
Talos: Come on. I love sporting his beautiful blue eyes.
Monica: No way, you guys have the best eyes. Don't ever change your eyes.
Carol: I'll help you find a home. Finish what Mar-Vell started.
Monica: They can stay here with us, can't they, Mom?
Maria: They won't be safe here, baby. Auntie Carol is right. They need their own home.
Carol: I'll be back before you know it.
Monica: Maybe I can fly up and meet you halfway.
Fury: Only if you learn to glow, like your Auntie Carol.
Monica: Or maybe I'll build a spaceship. You don't know.
Carol: He doesn't.
[Scene changes to Carol and Fury washing the dishes]
Carol: Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden.
Fury: You're sure that's what Marvel would want?
Carol: Mar-Vell.
Fury: That's what I said.
Carol: It's two words. Mar-Vell.
Fury: Mar-Vell. Marvel sounds a lot better. You know, like the Marvelettes? [Singing]  𝅘𝅥𝅮 Oh, yeah, wait a minute Mr. Postman. Ay, ay, ay, ay, Mr. Postman. 𝅘𝅥𝅮 Not ringing any bells?
Carol: Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.
[Carol takes out Fury's pages, which has her symbol on it.]
Carol: I upgraded it. Range should be, a couple galaxies, at least.
[She offers it to Fury, but before he can take it, she pulls it away.]
Fury: What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?
Carol: For emergencies only. Okay?
Fury: Well, if you're ever passing back through this galaxy, be sure to give a brother a shout.
[The two fist bump, and Carol teasingly electrocutes Fury, laughs it off.]
[Scene changes to outside of the house, where Monica gives Carol her leather jacket.]
Monica: We got the ketchup stain off.
Carol: Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble. It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.
Maria: Go on.
[Carol takes off and flies up to Mar-Vell's laboratory, where the Skrulls were waiting for her. She looks at the Earth one last time before flying inside the spaceship. As soon as she enters, the ship starts moving at lightspeed, towards other galaxies.]
[Scene changes to Fury, who is back in his office, wearing an eyepatch. He writes on his computer about ""The Protector Initiative"". Phil Coulson enters the room with a suitcase in his hands.]
Coulson: Glad to have you back, sir. This came for you.
[Fury opens the suitcase to reveal lots of prosthetic eyes of different colors.]
Coulson: So, is it true? That the Kree burned your eye out because you refused to give them the Tesseract?
Fury: I'll neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.
Coulson: Understood. I'm sorry to report that we still haven't found the Tesseract.
Fury: I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.
[Fury looks at Goose, who now lives with him]
Coulson: I'll let you know when it does.
Fury: Then what?
Coulson: Sir?
Fury: We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there. And our one-woman security force had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe. SHIELD alone can't protect us. We need to find more.
Coulson: More weapons?
Fury: More heroes.
Coulson: You think we can find others like her?
Fury: We found her and we weren't even looking.
Coulson: Get some rest, sir. You got a big decision to make.
[Fury looks through Carol's file and finds out that she was nicknamed ""Avenger"". He then decides to rename his project ""The Avengers Initiative"".]


[Mid-Credits scene]
[In 2018, The pager is seen with the Captain Marvel symbol. Second later, the pager turns off. In another room, The Avengers are dealing with the consequences of the failed counterattack against Thanos that lead to the decimation process as they return to the New Avengers Headquarters. On the computer, the numbers continues to rise as the global death toll reaches 3.2 billion.]
Steve Rogers: This is a nightmare.
Natasha Romanoff: I've had better nightmares.
[James Rhodes walks in]
James Rhodes (Rhodey): Hey. So that thing just stopped doing whatever the hell it was doing.
[Rhodes, Romanoff, and Rogers head to the chamber housing the transmitter device, where Bruce Banner is analyzing it.]
Natasha: What have we got?
Bruce Banner: Whatever the signal is sending, it finally creeped off.
Steve: I thought we bypassed the battery.
Rhodey: We did. It's still plugged in, it just... it just stopped.
Steve: Reboot and send the signal again.
Banner: We don't even know what this is.
Natasha: Fury did. Just do it, please. You tell me the second you get a signal. I want to know who's on the other end of that thing.
[As Romanoff turns around, she finds herself face to face with Carol Danvers.]
Carol: Where's Fury?
[Cut to black.]

 Captain America: Civil War
 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

     

[scene at the temple, sound of bell ringing. Some people are walking around out of the temple’s library. Showing the librarian are putting back a book to its shelves. the leader of ‘the people’ are showing off with a hood, making the librarian pay attention. two of them follow by, walking through the librarian with their leader. All of them showing off. two of them making spell that hold the librarian’s two arms, and two others making spell by a stick that hold his two legs. making him lifted. the librarian grimacing in pain. someone put a jug below his head. the leader walking closely to the librarian. the leader took off his hood. the librarian has a look at the leader. the leader places his hands onto his back and holding a pair of blades as he chops the librarian’s head off which falls into the jug. the leader takes the book that had been placed by the librarian. he opens the book searching for a page then rips it from the book, and throws the book away. he walks from his place and then…]
The Ancient One: Master Kaecilius. That ritual will bring you only sorrow
[he sets his hands to his back, holding his blade. she walks closer with both hands on her back. he runs escaping with his team with a portal, leading to a city. they run all over the streets, then stops. facing them self as a scattered mirror. The Ancient one walking behind them, controlling it. making them enter the mirror universe. Kaecilius turn his back as The Ancient One makes a wave pattern with her hand that makes buildings around them start to move unpatterned. Kaecilius looking around them.]
Kaecilius: Hypocrite!
[The Ancient One making a round pattern with both of his hands and turn the gravity as she hops off a wall of a building, and Kaecilius with his team do the same. The Ancient One making an upwards movement with both hands as the building behind them starts rolling itself. Kaecilius pulls out his blades as the others making spell and pull out their staff. two of them catch her feet with their spell as she pulls her feet back and makes them fall and she hops on them making a fan being spell for cutting they spells and they two got milled by the building under them as they scream. then she fights two other people and knocks them down. then she changes the spell to a round being spell as she kicks one of them to the rolling building that is getting closer to them. then she turns the spell into a fan being spell and she tackled two of them as she throws her spell to the other people left and holds it back. then she makes a turn around move with her hands that makes the gravity turn upside down. Kaecilius and the other are close to the position of falling, then Kaecilius makes a portal with a round and round pattern with his hand for him and his team to escape. then they hop onto that with Kaecilius still holding it open as The Ancient One still fighting three of them left. then Kaecilius hops onto the portal and closes it as The Ancient One knocks out the three people, and stares as the portal closes. then The Ancient One rewinds the rolling building and makes it as if none of this happened and hops of the building to the ground and she makes a portal out of the mirror universe to the real universe and walks through the street and removes her hood, revealing her bald head]




— At a hospital —
[showing someone washing his hand. drying them with a tissue. putting on a surgery suit. putting on his mask. putting on his rubber gloves. then facing a mirror with half raised back faced hand. showing a syringe been filled with a liquid. and a hand that is doing things with the body. and someone foot tapping and a little dancing body as he performs surgery. and some doctor outside writing and looking at them from the glass window]
Doctor Strange: Challenge round, Billy.
[Billy playing the other song]
Doctor Strange: Oh, come on, Billy. You’ve got to be messing with me.
Billy: Heheh. No, doctor.
Doctor Strange: Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977. Seriously, Billy, you said this one would be hard.
Billy: Hah! It’s 1978.
Doctor Strange: No, Billy, while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978, the album was released in December, 1977.
Billy: No, no. Wikipedia says the…
Doctor Strange: Check again.
Billy: When did you…?
Doctor that is helping Stephen: Where do you store all this useless information?
Doctor Strange: Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn. Status, Billy?
Dr. Billy: 1977.
Doctor that is helping Stephen: Oh! Please. I hate you.
Doctor Strange: Woah! ""Feels so good"", doesn’t it?
[someone looking through the door’s glass]
Doctor Strange: Oh, I…
Doctor that is helping Stephen: I’ve got this, Stephen. You’ve done your bit. Go ahead, we’ll close up.
Dr. Stephen Strange: What is that? [Christine hands him the device showing the patient's situation.]
Christine Palmer: GSW.
Doctor Strange: It’s amazing you kept him alive. Apneic, further brain stem testing after reflex test… I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer. You left a bullet in his head.
Christine Palmer: Thanks. It’s impinging on the medulla. I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death. Something about that doesn’t feel right to me.
Doctor Strange: We have to run.
Christine Palmer: Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
Dr. West: Organ harvesting. He’s a donor.
Christine Palmer: Slow down. I did not agree to that.
Dr. West: I don’t need you to. We’ve already called brain death.
Doctor Strange: Prematurely. We need to get him prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.
Dr. West: I’m not going to let you operate on a dead man.
Doctor Strange: [Holds up the scan of the patient's brain.] What do you see?
Dr. West: A bullet?
Doctor Strange: A perfect bullet. It’s been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony. A toxic metal. And it's leaking directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.
Dr. West: Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown. 
Christine Palmer: We need to go.
october Strange: The patient’s not dead, but he’s dying. Do you still want to harvest his organs?
Dr. West: I’ll assist you.
Doctor Strange: [Wheels the patient's bed down the hallway, Christine follows him.] No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.
Christine Palmer: Thank you. [Begins to hook the patient up to devices.] Image status, STAT.
Dr. Stephen Strange: We do not have time for that.
Christine Palmer: You can’t do it freehand.
Doctor Strange: I can and I will.
Dr. West: This isn’t the time for showing off, Strange.
Doctor Strange: How about 10 minutes ago, when you called the wrong time of death? [Selects a pair of bent scissors and inspects the patient's brain on a screen.] Cranial nerves intact. [He artfully reaches into the brian with the thin scissors. There is a loud ticking noise coming from Dr. west's watch. He doesn't look away from the patient.] Dr. West, cover your watch.
[Dr. West slides a hand over his expensive watch. Back to Stephen Strange, who is delicately performing the surgery's. His steady hand reaches in, and the scissors clasp around the billet. He slowly draws out th scissors and opens them, dropping the all blue bullet into a tray. It's out. Cheers fill the room.]




[Doctor Palmer and Doctor Strange walk down the hospital hallway, talking to each other.]
Christine Palmer: You know, you didn’t have to humiliate him in front of everyone.
Doctor Strange: I didn’t have to save his patient either. [He dances slightly as when walks.] But, you know, sometimes I just can’t help myself.
Christine Palmer: Nick is a great doctor.
Doctor Strange: You came to me.
Christine Palmer: Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
Doctor Strange: You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one.
Christine Palmer: Well, all the more reason you should be my neurosurgeon on call. You could make such a difference.
Dr. Stephen Strange: I can’t work in your butcher shop.
Christine Palmer: [slightly offended] Hey! Look, he…
Doctor Strange: Look, I’m fusing transected spinal cords. I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system. The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come. In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.
Christine Palmer: Yeah, you’re right. In the ER, you’re only saving lives. There’s no fame, there’s no CNN interviews… Well, I guess I’ll have to stick with Nick.
Doctor Strange: Wait a minute. You’re not…you guys aren’t…
Christine Palmer: What?
Doctor Strange: Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.
Crhstine Palmer: Explicit, actually. And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.
Doctor Strange: Oh really?
[They come to a stop outside of Christine's post.]
Christine Palmer: I call it the Strange policy.
Doctor Strange: Oh, good! I’m glad something is named after me. You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure, and yet, somehow, no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.
Christine Palmer: We invented that technique.
Doctor Strange: You know, I gotta say, I’m very flattered by your policy. Look, I’m talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.
Christine Palmer: Another speaking engagement? So romantic.
Doctor Strange: You used to love going to those things with me. We had fun together.
Christine Palmer: No. You had fun. They weren’t about us, they were about you.
Doctor Strange: Not only about me.
Christine Palmer: Stephen. Everything is about you.
Doctor Strange: Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique. 
Christine Palmer: [She walks as away, but looks back over her shoulder, grinning.] Palmer-Strange.
[He grins too. he's gotten her.]




[We see a fancy, expensive apartment--huge windows looking out on a beautiful city, and Doctor Strange walks in front of the windows, arrogance in his step. Switch scenes to show him pulling open a drawer full of twenty or so watches, rotating on their display. He wonders for a moment and then picks an especially expensive looking one. Switch setting to show him driving recklessly out of his apartment building's driveway in an expensive car. Later, on the road, he is still driving just as recklessly, but in the rainy darkness.]
Doctor Strange: [To Billy, on the phone.] Billy! What have you got for me?
Billy: I’ve got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel. Crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor. Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.
Doctor Strange: Well, I could help, but so can 50 other people. Find me something worth my time.
Billy: I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.
Doctor Strange: Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record? Definitely not.
Billy: How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia struck by lightning?

Doctor Strange: That does sound interesting. Could you send me the… [His phone screen lights up with the patient's documents] got it. Hey.

[Another car appears on the road. Doctor Strange swerves out of the way and goes off the road, off the side of a mountain. The car crashes, Stephen blacks out]
Christine Palmer: [Stephen wakes up in a hospital bed and see his hands in traction. Christine is next to his bed.] It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.
Doctor Strange: [hoarsely]What did they do?
Christine Palmer: They rushed you in a chopper. But it took a little while to find you. Golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.
Doctor Strange: What did they do?!?
Christine Palmer: 11 stainless steel pins in the bones. Multiple torn ligaments. Severe nerve damage in both hands. You were on the table for 11 hours.
Doctor Strange: Look at these fixators.
Christine Palmer: No one could have done better.
Doctor Strange: I could have done better.
Christine Palmer: No. No.

[A scene later in time. All Stephen's wounds are gone, except for the shaking in his ruined hands.]
Doctor: Give your body time to heal.
Doctor Strange: You ruined me. How long until I’m…

[Doctor Strange's apartment, where a team of doctors are gathered around his table.]
Doctor One: Doctor Strange… those tissues are still healing.
Doctor Strange: So speed it up. Pass the stent under the brachial artery under the radial artery.
Doctor Two: It’s possible. Experimental and expensive, but possible.
Doctor Strange: All I need is possible.

[Doctor Strange has metal around his hand, pulling his fingers in, and he is excercising his weak hands by trying to fight against them. He is being supervised by a young doctor.] 
Young Doctor: Up. Up. Show me your strength.
[Doctor Strange groans in frustration, and his hands close.]
Doctor Stephen Strange: Ah! It’s useless.
Young Doctor: It’s not useless, man, you can do this.
Doctor Strange: [He tries again, but he's annoyed. And still arrogan.] Then answer me this, bachelor’s degree. Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe to do this, and actually recover?
Young Doctor: One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away. He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair. He came in 3 times a week. But one day he stopped coming. I thought he was dead. A few years later, he walked past me on the street.
Doctor Strange: He walked? 
Young Doctor: Yeah, he walked.
Doctor Strange: Bullshit. Show me his file.
Young Doctor: It can take me a while to pull the files from the archive. But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong, it’s worth it.

[Dr. Strange is having a conversation with an elite doctor through his tablet. As he does so, right particles writing his name with his trembling hand.]
Etienne: I looked at all your research. I read all the papers you’ve sent, but… none will work. I… I don’t think you realize how severe the damage is, I…
Doctor Strange: Look, here’s the thing, I…
Etienne: At best, I’d try and fail. Look, I understand. Here’s the thing. I… What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.
Doctor Strange Come on…
Etienne: I’ve got my own reputation to consider.
Doctor Strange: Etienne, wait.
Etienne:I can’t help you…
Doctor Strange: No. No, no, wait!
[Too late. Etienne hangs up. Doctor Strange yells in frustration and knocks the tablet and the papers he's been practicing on off of the table. He sits there a moment, defeated, before the door opens and Christine walks in.]
Christine Palmer: Hi. [Seeing his face.] He won’t do it.
Doctor Strange: He’s a hack. There’s a new procedure in Tokyo. They culture donor stem cells and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold. If I could get a loan together, just…
Christine Palmer: Stephen…
Doctor Strange: A small loan, 200,000.
Christine Palmer: Stephen. You’ve always spent money as fast as you could make it but now you’re spending money you don’t even have. Maybe it’s time to consider stopping.
Dr. Stephen Strange: No. Now is exactly the time not to stop. Because, you see, I’m not getting any better! [He goldsmith up his shaking hands angrily.]
Christine Palmer: But this isn’t medicine anymore. This is mania. Some things just can’t be fixed.
Doctor Strange: Life without my work…
Christine Palmer: Is still life. This isn’t the end. There are other things that can give your life meaning.
Doctor Strange:[Spitefully]Like what? Like you?
Christine Palmer: And this is the part where you apologize.
Doctor Strange: This is the part where you leave.
Christine Palmer: Fine. I can’t watch you do this to yourself anymore. [She move soon to leave.]
Doctor Strange: Too difficult for you, is it?
Christine Palmer: Yes. It is. And it breaks my heart to see you this way. 
Doctor Strange: No. Don’t pity me.
Christine Palmer: I’m not pitying you.
Doctor Strange: Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here? Bringing cheese and wine as if we’re old friends going for a picnic? We are not friends, Christine. We were barely lovers. You just love a sob story, don’t you? Is that what I am to you now? Poor Stephen Strange, charity case. He finally needs me. Another dregmof humanity for you to work on. Fix him up and send him back into the world, heart is just humming… [Shouting] You care so much, don't you?!?
Christine Palmer: Goodbye, Stephen. [She drops her keys to his apartment on the the table and stalks out. He stared out ant the city, his hands still shaking. Zoom in on the paper on the floor, where writing out his name. The lines are shaky, incomplete, and illegible.]

[Doctor Strange sifts through medical files with his trembling hands. He finds a couple of files with a post-it notebook on it that reads ""Told you so!""

[A basketball court, with men playing basketball and shouting at each other. Is Doctor Strange's jealous of how carefree and active they are?]
Man 1: Come on, man! Where is the competition?
Man 2: You talk a lot!
[One then a walks over to the edge of the four court to a drink  of water even water. Doctor Strange approaches him through the fence. 
Doctor Strange: Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.
Pangborn: Who are you?
Doctor Strange: Paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Partial paralysis of both hands.
Pangborn: I don’t know you.
Dr. Stephen Strange: I’m Stephen Strange. I’m a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.
Pangborn: Actually, you know what, man? I think I know you. I came to your office once. You refused to see me. I never got past your assistant.
Doctor Strange: You were untreatable.
Pangborn: No glory for you in that, right?
Doctor Strange: You came back from a place there is no way back from! I… I’m trying to find my own way back.

Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?

Pangborn: Alright. I’d given up on my body. I thought my mind was the only thing I had left. I should at least try to elevate that. So I sat with gurus, and sacred women. Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men. And finally, I found my teacher. And my mind was elevated. And my spirit deepened. And somehow…

Dr. Stephen Strange: Your body healed. 

Pangborn: Yes. And there were deeper secrets to learn then, but I did not have the strength to receive them. I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home. The place you’re looking for is called Kamar-Taj. But the cost is high.

Dr. Stephen Strange: How much?

Pangborn: I’m not talking about money. Good luck.

Give me the ball!
Kathmandu, Nepal
Excuse me. Kamar-Taj?
Do you know where Kamar-Taj is?
Sign: ""Himalayan Healing!
Find Peace! Find Yourself!""
Kamar-Taj?
Kamar-Taj…
Okay.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Guys, I… I don’t have any money.

- Your watch.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, please. It’s all I have left.

- Your watch.

Dr. Stephen Strange: All right.

Mordo: You’re looking for Kamar-Taj?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Really? Are you sure you got the right place? That one looks a little more...Kamar-Taj-y.

Mordo: I once stood in your place. And I, too, was… disrespectful. So might I offer you some advice Forget everything you think you know.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Uh… alright.

Mordo: The sanctuary of our teacher, the Ancient One.

Dr. Stephen Strange: The Ancient One? What’s his real name? Right. Forget everything I think I know. I’m sorry. Thank you for… huh! Okay, that’s, uh… a thing…Thank you. Hello. Uh, thank you. And thank you. Uh, thank you, Ancient One…for… seeing me…

The Ancient One: You’re very welcome. Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir. Mr. Strange!

Dr. Stephen Strange: Doctor, actually.

The Ancient One: Well, no. Not anymore, surely. Isn’t that why you’re here? You’ve undergone many procedures. Seven, right?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah…Good tea.

The Ancient One: Yes.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man?

The Ancient One: In a way.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You helped him to walk again.

The Ancient One: Yes. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: How do you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

The Ancient One: Oh, I didn’t correct it. He couldn’t walk; I convinced him that he could.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You’re not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

The Ancient One: When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you who heals it back together or the body?

Dr. Stephen Strange: It’s the cells.

The Ancient One: And the cells are only programmed to put themselves together in very specific ways.

Dr. Stephen Strange: That’s right. 

The Ancient One: What if I told you that your own body could be convinced to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

Dr. Stephen Strange: You’re talking about cellular regeneration. That’s… bleeding-edge medical tech. Is that why you’re working here, without a governing medical board? I mean… just how experimental is your treatment?

The Ancient One: Quite.

Dr. Stephen Strange: So, you figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

The Ancient One: No, Mr. Strange. I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Spirit… to heal the body. Huh. A… Al… Al… alright. How do we do that? Where do we start?

The Ancient One: Don’t like that map?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Oh, no. It’s… it’s very good. It’s just…you know, I’ve seen it before. In gift shops.

The Ancient One: And what about this one?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

The Ancient One: What about… that one?

Dr. Stephen Strange: You’re showing me an MRI scan? I can not believe this.

The Ancient One: Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part, but not the whole.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I spent my last dollar getting here on a one-way ticket, and you’re talking to me about healing through belief?

The Ancient One: You’re a man who’s looking at the world through a keyhole, and you spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole. To see more, know more. And now, on hearing that it can be widened in ways you can’t imagine, you reject the possibility?

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter, and nothing more. We’re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe.

The Ancient One: You think too little of yourself.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don’t. But I see through you!!! What did you just do to me?!? 

The Ancient One: I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What’s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?

The Ancient One: Just tea. With a little honey.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What just happened? 

The Ancient One: For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What?? 

The Ancient One: A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Why are you doing this to me?

The Ancient One: To show you just how much you don’t know. Open your eye.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No! No… No! Shit! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! This isn’t real it isn’t real it isn’t

Mordo: His heart rate are getting dangerously high.

The Ancient One: He looks alright to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life-giving, others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places, where powers older than time lie… ravenous… and waiting. Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Teach me!

The Ancient One: No.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No… No! No, no, no, no no no no! No! Open the door! Please!

The Ancient One: Thank you, Masters. You think I’m wrong to cast him out?

Mordo: 5 hours later, he’s still on your doorstep. There’s a strength to him.

The Ancient One: Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition…I’ve seen it all before.

Mordo: He reminds you of Kaecilius?

The Ancient One: I can not lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness.

Mordo: You didn’t lose me. I wanted the power to defeat my enemies. You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law.

The Ancient One: We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them.

Mordo: Kaecilius still has the stolen pages. If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all. There may be dark days ahead. Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Don’t shut me out. I’ve nowhere else to go. Thank you.

Mordo: Bathe, rest, meditate if you can. The Ancient One will send for you.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Uh, what’s this? My mantra?

Mordo: The Wi-Fi password. We’re not savages.

Time will tell how much I love you.
- Christine

The Ancient One: The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language ""spells"". But if that word offends your modern sensibilities, you can call it ""program"". The source code that shapes reality. We harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse, to cast spells, conjure shields and weapons to make magic.

Dr. Stephen Strange: But… even if my fingers could do that, My hands would just be waving in the air. I mean, how do I get from here to there?

The Ancient One: How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and put a human spine back together bone by bone?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Study and practice. Years of it. Hey.

Wong: Mr. Strange.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Uh… Stephen, please. And you are?

Wong: Wong. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Wong. Just Wong? Like… Adele? Or… Aristotle. Drake. Bono. Eminem.

Wong: The Book of the Invisible Sun, Astronomia Nova, Codex Imperium, Key of Solomon. You finished all of this?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yup.

Wong: Come with me.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Alright.

Wong: This section is for Masters only. But at my discretion, others may use it. We should start with Maxim’s Primer. How is your Sanskrit?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I’m fluent in Google Translate.

Wong: Read it. Classical Sanskrit.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What are those?

Wong: The Ancient One’s private collection.

Dr. Stephen Strange: So they’re forbidden?

Wong: No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden. Only certain practices. Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

Dr. Stephen Strange: This one’s got pages missing.

Wong: That’s the book of Cagliostro. The study of time. One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master. A zealot called Kaecilius. Just after he strung up the former librarian, and relieved him of his head. I’m now the guardian of these books. So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again, I’d know it. And you’d be dead before you ever left the compound.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What if it’s just overdue? You know? Any… late fees I should know about? Maybe, perhaps, uhm…Uh, you know, people used to think that I was funny.

Wong: Did they work for you?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Alright. Well, it’s been lovely talking to you, thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and for the threat upon my life.

Kaecilius: Now we receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us. The one who betrays the world.

Mordo: Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts. They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse. All you need to do is focus. Visualize. See the destination in your mind. Look beyond the world in front of you. Imagine every detail. The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier, the gateway will come. And stop.

The Ancient One: I’d like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.

Mordo: Of course.

Dr. Stephen Strange: My hands.

The Ancient One: It’s not about your hands.

Dr. Stephen Strange: How is this not about my hands?

The Ancient One: Master Hamir. Thank you, Master Hamir. You cannot beat a river into submission. You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I… I control it by surrendering control? That doesn’t make any sense.

The Ancient One: Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego and your power will rise. Come with me.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Wait. Is this…

The Ancient One: Everest. It’s beautiful. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah, you’re right. Beautiful. It’s freezing, but… beautiful.

The Ancient One: At this temperature, a person can last for 13 minutes before suffering permanent loss of function. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Great.

The Ancient One: But you will likely go into shock within the first 2 minutes. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: What?

The Ancient One: Surrender, Stephen.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, no!!! Don’t!

Mordo: How is our new recruit?

The Ancient One: We shall see. Any second now.

Mordo: No, not again. Maybe I should…

Wong: Stephen.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Wong.

Wong: What do you want, Strange?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Books on astral projection.

Wong: You’re not ready for that.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Try me, Beyonce. Come on. You’ve heard of her. She’s a huge star, right? Do you ever laugh? Oh come on, just give me the book, huh?

Wong: No.

The Ancient One: Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn. Now I’m told you question every lesson, preferring to teach yourself.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes. Now I’m being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.

The Ancient One: Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Wong told on me? 

The Ancient One: You’re advancing quickly with your sorcery skills. You need a safe space to practice your spells. You are now inside the Mirror Dimension. Ever present but undetected. The real world isn’t affected by what happens here. We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil, and sometimes to contain threats. You don’t want to be stuck in here without your sling ring.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?

The Ancient One: Learning of an infinite multiverse included learning of infinite dangers. And if I told you everything else that you don’t already know, you’d run from here in terror.

Dr. Stephen Strange: So, just how ancient is she?

Mordo: No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You follow her even though you don’t know?

Mordo: I know that she’s steadfast, but unpredictable. Merciless, yet kind. She made me what I am. Trust your teacher. And don’t lose your way.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Like Kaecilius?

Mordo: That’s right.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You knew him.

Mordo: When he first came to us, he’d lost everyone he ever loved. He was a grieving and broken man, searching for answers in the mystic arts. A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong. Questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching. He left Kamar-Taj. His disciples followed him like sheep, seduced by false doctrine.

Dr. Stephen Strange: He stole the forbidden ritual, right?

Mordo: Yeah.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What did it do?

Mordo: No more questions.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What’s that?

Mordo: That’s a question. This is a relic. Some magic is too powerful to sustain, so we imbue objects with it, allowing them to take the strain we can not. This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal. There are many relics: the Wand of Watoomb, the Bolting Boots of Voltor.

Dr. Stephen Strange: They just roll of the tongue, don’t they? When do I get my relic?

Mordo: When you’re ready.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I think I’m ready.

Mordo: You’re ready when the relic decides you’re ready. For now, conjure a weapon.

Yeah.

Mordo: Fight! Fight like your life depended on it! Because one day, it may.

Christine
I’m emailing you one more time to

Dr. Stephen Strange: Wong? Okay. First, open the Eye of Agamotto. All right. Oh my. Dormammu. The Dark Dimension. Eternal life?

[after Strange has been caught reading the text Kaecilius stole and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto]

Mordo: Stop!!!

Tampering with the continuum of probability is forbidden!
Dr. Stephen Strange: I… I wa… I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!
And what did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual?
Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah, I don’t know. I hadn’t gotten to that part yet.
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time. Unstable dimensional openings. Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!
Mordo: You want to get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever, or never having existed at all?
Dr. Stephen Strange: They really should put the warnings before that stuff.
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.
You weren’t manipulating the space-time continuum, you were wrecking it.
We do not tamper with natural law. We defend it.
How did you learn to do that?
Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I’ve got a photographic memory. It’s how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

Mordo: What you just did takes more than a good memory. You were born for the mystic arts.

Dr. Stephen Strange: And yet, my hands still shake.

- For now, yes.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Not forever?

Mordo: We’re not prophets.

Dr. Stephen Strange: When do you start telling me what we are?

While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats. 
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme, going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts, the mighty Agamotto.
The same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power, where great cities now stand.
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum, that door to the New York Sanctum. That one, to the London Sanctum.
Together, the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.
Mordo: The Sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.
Dr. Stephen Strange: From what?
Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.
Dr. Stephen Strange: Like Dormammu?
Where did you learn that name?
Dr. Stephen Strange: I just read it in The Book of Cagliostro. Why?
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension, beyond time.
He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.
A being of infinite power and endless hunger, on a quest to invade every universe and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.
And he hungers for Earth most of all.
The pages that Kaecilius stole.
A ritual to contact Dormammu and draw power from the Dark Dimension.
Dr. Stephen Strange: Uuuh… okay. Okay. I… time-out. I… I came here to heal my hands, not to fight in some mystical war.
London.
Kaecilius!
No!!!
Dr. Stephen Strange: Wong? Mordo?
177A Bleecker Street
Hello?
Hello?

Kaecilius: Daniel. I see they made you Master of the Sanctum.

Master: Do you know what that means?

Kaecilius: That you’ll die protecting it.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Stop!

Kaecilius: How long have you been at Kamar-TaJ, Mister…?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Doctor.

Kaecilius: Just Doctor?

Dr. Stephen Strange: It’s Strange.

Kaecilius: Maybe. Who am I to judge? You don’t know how to use that, do you?

What?
You’ll die here.
- Oh, stop it.
I said, stop it!

Kaecilius: You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Why…look, I don’t even know what ""this"" is.

Kaecilius: It’s the end and the beginning. The many becoming the few, becoming the One.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Look, if you’re not going to start making sense, I’m just going to have to put this thing back on.

Kaecilius: Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Alright, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

Kaecilius: You are a doctor?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yes. 

Kaecilius: A scientist. You understand the laws of nature. All things age. All things die. In the end, our sun burns out, our universe grows cold and perishes. But the Dark Dimension… it’s a place beyond time.

Dr. Stephen Strange: That’s it. I’m putting this thing back on.

Kaecilius: This world doesn’t have to die, Doctor. This world can take its rightful place among so many others, as part of the One. The great and beautiful One. And we can all live forever.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Really? What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

Kaecilius: The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What about the people you killed?

Kaecilius: Tiny, momentary specks within an indifferent universe. Yes. You see, you see what we’re doing? The world is not what it ought to be. Humanity longs for the eternal, for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us. Time is an insult. Death is an insult. Doctor…We don’t seek to rule this world. We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution, the Why of all existence.

Dr. Stephen Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

Kaecilius: What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor? Was it enlightenment? Power? You came to be healed, as did we all. Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things. We all come with the promise of being healed, but instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks. The real magic she keeps for herself. Have you ever wondered how she managed to live this long?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I… I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.

Kaecilius: So, you know. The ritual gives me the power to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down, to let the Dark Dimension in. Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely: life, everlasting. He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No. I mean, come on. Look at your face. Dormammu made you a murderer. Just how good can his kingdom be? You think that’s funny?

Kaecilius: No. No, Doctor. What’s funny is that you’ve lost your sling ring.

Sir, can I help you?
Dr. Stephen Strange: Dr. Palmer, where is she?
Sir, we need to…
Dr. Stephen Strange: Where is she?
- At the nurses station.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Christine!

Christine: Stephen? Oh my god. What…

Dr. Stephen Strange: We need to get me on an operation table now. Just you. Now! I don’t have any time!

Christine: What happened?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

Christine: What are you wearing?

The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood… is in the pericardial sac.
No. No no no no no no no!

Christine: Stephen! Stephen!

Dr. Stephen Strange: Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle.

Christine: Stephen? Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?

Dr. Stephen Strange: My astral body.

Christine: Are you dead?

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, Christine, but I am dying.

Right. Right.
Yeah. Alright.

Christine: I’ve… I’ve never seen a wound like this before. What were you stabbed with?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I don’t know. I’m going to have to vanish now.

Christine: No, I…

Dr. Stephen Strange: Keep me alive, will you?

Christine: Okay! Okay.

Oh shit!
Charging to 200 Joule

Christine: Stephen, come on.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Hit me again!

Christine: Stop doing that!

Dr. Stephen Strange: Up the voltage and hit me again.

Christine: No, your heart is beating!

Dr. Stephen Strange: Just do it!

Oh god!
Are you ok?
- Hey there.
Okay.

Christine: After all this time, you just show up here, flying out of your body?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah, I know. I missed you too, by the way. I wrote 2 emails, but you never responded.

Christine: Why would I?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. And you were right, I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more.

Christine: Stop. You… you’re clearly in shock. I mean, what the hell is happening? Where have you been?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Well, after Western medicine failed me, I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.

Christine: Kathmandu?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah.

Christine: What, like the Bob Seger song?

Dr. Stephen Strange: 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj and I talked to someone called the Ancient One, and…

Christine: Oh. So you joined a cult.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, I didn’t. Not exactly. I mean, they did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.

Christine: Yeah, that sounds like a cult.

Dr. Stephen Strange: It’s not a cult.

Christine: Well, that’s what a cultist would say.

- Oh, no.

Christine: Wait, Stephen… what do you think you’re doing?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I’m late for a cult meeting.

Christine: This is insane.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah.

Christine: Where are you going?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Uhm…

Christine: Just tell me the truth?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave himself over to an ancient entity who can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me, but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village, and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that I opened up in the mop closet.

Christine: Okay. Don’t tell me. Fine.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I really do have to go.

Mordo: Strange! You’re okay.

Dr. Stephen Strange: A relative term, but yeah, I’m okay.

Mordo: The Cloak of Levitation. It came to you.

The Ancient One: No minor feat. It’s a fickle thing.

Dr. Stephen Strange: He’s escaped.

- Kaecilius?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will.

The Ancient One: He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah.

The Ancient One: How many more?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Two. I stranded one in the desert.

And the other? 

Dr. Stephen Strange: His body was in the hall. Master Drumm was in the foyer.

Mordo: He’s been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

The London Sanctum has fallen.
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

The Ancient One: You defended the New York Sanctum from attack. With its Master gone, it needs another, Master Strange.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No. It is Dr. Strange. Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange, Doctor Strange. When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm. And I have just killed a man! I’m not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

The Ancient One: You become a doctor to save one life above all others: your own.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Still seeing through me, are you?

The Ancient One: I see what I’ve always seen: your over-inflated ego. You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything, even death, which no one can control. Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Not even Dormammu? He offers immortality.

The Ancient One: It’s our fear of death that gives Dormammu life. He feeds off it.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Like you feed on him? You talk to me about controlling death. Well, I know how you do it. I’ve seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro.

The Ancient One: Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Because you might not like them?

The Ancient One: Because you may not know of what you speak.

Mordo: What is he talking about?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I’m talking about her long life, the source of her immortality. She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.

Mordo: That’s not true.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I’ve seen the rituals and worked them out. I know how you do it.

The Ancient One: Once they regroup, the zealots will be back. You’ll need reinforcements.

Dr. Stephen Strange: She is not who you think she is.

Mordo: You don’t have the right to say that. You have no idea of the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, and I don’t want to know.

Mordo: You’re a coward.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Because I’m not a killer?

Mordo: These zealots will snuff us all out, and you can muster the strength to snuff them out first?

Dr. Stephen Strange: What do you think I just did?

Mordo: You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

Dr. Stephen Strange: When you would have done it so easily?

Mordo: You have no idea the things I’ve done…And the answer is yes. Without hesitation.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Even if there’s another way?

Mordo: There is no other way.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You lack imagination.

Mordo: No, Stephen. You lack a spine. They’re back. We have to end this. Now! Strange! Get down here and fight!

Dr. Stephen Strange: The Mirror Dimension. You can’t affect the real world in here. Who’s laughing now, asshole?

Kaecilius: I am.

Dr. Stephen Strange: They’ve got no sling ring. I mean, they can’t escape, right?

Run!

Mordo: Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension. They can’t affect the real world, but they can still kill us. This wasn’t clever. This was suicide!

That is hilarious.

Dr. Stephen Strange: This was a mistake.

Mordo: It’s true. She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

The Ancient One: Kaecilius.

Kaecilius: I came to you broken, lost, bleeding. I trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

The Ancient One: I tried to protect you.

Kaecilius: From the truth? 

The Ancient One: From yourself.

Kaecilius: I have a new teacher now.

The Ancient One: Dormammu deceives you You have no idea of what he truly is. His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

Kaecilius: Liar.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Christine!!!

Christine: Are you kidding me? Oh my god.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No fibrillation…

Christine: It’s neurogenic?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yes. Nick? We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

She still drops. 
We’re losing her!
- You need to increase her oxygen!
I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!
No reflexes.
I’m not reading any brain activity.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What are you doing? You’re dying! You have to return to your body now. You don’t have time.

The Ancient One: Time is relative. Your body hasn’t even hit the floor yet. I’ve spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can’t see past it. I’ve prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there’s always another. And they all lead here, but never further.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You think this is where you die.

The Ancient One: Do you wonder what I see in your future?

Dr. Stephen Strange: No. Yes. 

The Ancient One: I never saw your future, only its possibilities. You have such a capacity for goodness. You always excelled, but not because you crave success, but because of your fear of failure.

Dr. Stephen Strange: It’s what made me a great doctor.

The Ancient One: It’s precisely what kept you from greatness. Arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Which is?

The Ancient One: It’s not about you. When you first came to me, you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn’t. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

Dr. Stephen Strange:He uses magic to walk.

The Ancient One: Constantly. He had a choice: to return to to his own life, or to serve something greater than himself.

Dr. Stephen Strange: So, I could have my hands back again? My old life?

The Ancient One: You could. And the world would be all the lesser for it. I’ve hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension, but as you well know, sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Mordo won’t see it that way.

The Ancient One: Mordo’s soul is rigid and unmovable, forged by the fires of his youth. He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength. Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I’m not ready.

The Ancient One: No one ever is. We don’t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered, your time is short. You’d think after all this time I’d be ready. But look at me: stretching one moment out into a thousand, just so I can watch the snow.

Christine: Are you okay?

I don’t understand what’s happening.
- I know.
But I have to go right now.

Dr. Stephen Strange: You said that losing my hands didn’t have to be the end, that it could be a beginning.

Christine: Yeah.

Because there are other ways to save lives.

Dr. Stephen Strange:A harder way.

Christine: A weirder way.

Dr. Palmer, the ER, please.
Dr. Palmer, the ER.

Dr. Stephen Strange: I don’t want to let you go.

Stop.
Hong Kong

Wong: Choose your weapon wisely. No one steps foot in this Sanctum. No one. Kaecilius.

Kaecilius: You’re on the wrong side of history, Wong.

Dr. Stephen Strange: She’s dead.

Mordo: You were right. She wasn’t who I thought she was.

Dr. Stephen Strange: She was complicated.

Mordo: Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile, dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden, while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

Dr. Stephen Strange: She did what she thought was right.

Mordo: The bill comes due. Don’t you see? Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu. Kaecilius was her fault. And here we are, in the consequence of her deception: a world on fire.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen, and New York has been attacked. Twice. You know where they’re going next. Hong Kong. You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it, because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I can not defeat them alone.

Mordo: The Sanctum has already fallen. The Dark Dimension. Dormammu is coming. It’s too late. Nothing can stop him. 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Not necessarily.

No.
Dr. Stephen Strange: Spells working. We got a second chance.
No!

Dr. Stephen Strange: Wong! I’m breaking the laws of nature, I know.

Wong: Well, don’t stop now.

When the Sanctum is restored, they will
attack again. We have to defend it.
Come on!
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!
We will finish this.

Kaecilius: You can’t fight the inevitable. Isn’t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Beyond time…

Strange!

Kaecilius: He’s gone. Stephen Strange has left to surrender to his power.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.

Dormammu: You’ve come to die. Your world is now my world, like all worlds.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.

Dormammu: You’ve come to die. Your world is now my world...What is this? Illusion? 

Dr. Stephen Strange: No, this is real.

Dormammu: Good.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.

Dormammu: You… what is happening?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension, I’ve brought a little power from mine. This is time: endless looped time.

Dormammu: You dare!

Dr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.

Dormammu: You cannot do this forever.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Actually, I can. This is how things are now: you and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.

Dormammu: Then you will spend eternity dying.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.

Dormammu: But you will suffer.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Pain is an old friend. Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.

Dormammu: End this!

Dr. Strange: Dormammu!… Dormammu!… Dormammu!… [time loop]

Dormammu: You will never win.

Dr. Stephen Strange: No…But I can lose. Again, and again, and again, and again, forever. And that makes you my prisoner.

Dormammu: No. Stop! Make this stop!!! Set me free!

Dr. Stephen Strange: No. I’ve come to bargain.

Dormammu: Oh, what do you want?

Dr. Stephen Strange: Take your zealots from the Earth, end your assault on my world, never come back: do it, and I’ll break the loop.

Get up, Strange.
Get up and fight!
We will finish this.

Kaecilius: Isn’t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. What have you done?

Dr. Stephen Strange: I made a bargain.

Kaecilius: What is this? 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Well, it’s, uh…it’s everything you ever wanted: eternal life as part of the One. You’re not going to like it. I think he really should have stolen the whole book, because the warnings… the warnings come after the spells.

Wong: Oh, that’s funny.

We did it.
Yes.
Yes, we did it.
By also violating the natural laws.
Look around you. It’s over.

Mordo: You still think there will be no consequences, Strange? No price to pay? We broke our rules, just like her. The bill comes due. Always. A reckoning. I will follow this path no longer.

Yeah, it’s okay.

Wong: Wise choice. You’ll wear the Eye of Agamotto once you’ve mastered its powers. Until then, best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone.

Dr. Stephen Strange: A what?

Wong: You might have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One’s death will spread through the Multiverse. Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready.

Dr. Stephen Strange: We’ll be ready.

[Mid-Credits scene: Thor is meeting with Strange

Thor: So, Earth has wizards now, huh? 

Dr. Stephen Strange: Tea?

Thor: I don’t drink tea.

Dr. Stephen Strange: What do you drink?

Thor: Not tea.

[Strange uses his powers to transform the teacup Thor is holding into a stein of beer]

Dr. Stephen Strange: So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

Thor: A worthy inclusion.

Dr. Stephen Strange: Yeah. So, why bring him here to New York?

Thor: That's a long story. A family drama, that kind of thing, but… we’re looking for my father.

Doctor Strange: Oh, okay. So, if you’ve found Odin, you all will return to Asgard, probably?

Thor: Oh, yes. Probably.

Doctor Strange: Alright. Let me help you.

[Post-Credits scene: Jonathan Pangborn senses someone in his workshop]

Jonathan: Can I help you?

Karl Mordo: They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher. Look at you now. Pangborn.

Jonathan: Mordo. So, what can I do for you? Man!

Karl Mordo: You been away many months now and I heard a revelation. The true purpose of a sorcerer is to twist things out of there proper shape. Stealing power, providing nature… like you.

Jonathan: I stolen nothing. This is my power. Mine.

Karl Mordo: Power… has a purpose.

[Pangborn picks up a crowbar and tries to attack Mordo, but Mordo takes his powers and makes Pangborn paralysed again]

Jonathan: Why you doing this?

Karl Mordo: Because I see it long last was wrong with the world. Too many sorcerers.

Speaker
Dialogue


 First lines. Earth 1988. Young Peter Quill sits in the waiting room of a hospital, listening to the ""Awesome Mix"" tape on his Walkman when his grandfather comes over to him


 Grandpa
 Peter, your mama wants to speak with you. Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off. [he takes the mixtape off of Peter, turns off the Walkman, takes Peter to see his mother, who’s lying sick in bed, she notices his eye is bruised]


 Meredith Quill
 Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby? [Peter shrugs his shoulders] Peter?


 Young Quill
 They killed a little frog that ain’t done nothin’. Smushed it with a stick.


 Meredith Quill
 You’re so like your daddy. You even look like him. And he was an angel. Composed of pure light [Meredith’s eyes close for a moment]


 Grandpa
 Mer? You got a present there for Peter, don’t you?


 Meredith Quill
 Of course. [she touches the small wrapped present and card, her father takes them and puts them in Peter’s backpack]


 Grandpa
 There. I’ve got you covered, Pete.


 Meredith Quill
 You open it up when I’m gone, okay? [Peter’s eyes start welling up with tears] Your grandpa is gonna take such good care of you. At least until your daddy comes back to get you. Take my hand. [she opens her hand but Peter looks away] Peter. [Peter begins to cry]


 Grandpa
 Pete, come on.


 Meredith Quill
 Take my hand. [just then Meredith’s heart stops]


 Young Quill
 Mom? No! No! No! No! Mom! No! [as the doctor’s rush into Meredith’s room, Peter’s grandfather carries Peter]


 Grandpa
 Come with me.


 Young Quill
 No! No!


 Grandpa
 You’ve got to stay here. Please.


 Young Quill
 No…


 Grandpa
 Okay? [Peter watches his grandfather walk back into the room, then Peter runs outside he falls to his knees as he weeps]


 Young Quill
 No. [suddenly a spaceship appears above him and abducts him] Mom!





 26 Year Later on Morag, an abandoned planet, adult Peter Quill searches for a mysterious orb, as he enters the cave where the orb is located, Peter puts on his Walkman to listen to ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone, he starts dancing and singing along as he finds the orb, just he's about to take the orb he is intercepted by Korath and his henchmen


 Korath
 Drop it!


Peter Quill: Uh… hey.[Korath instructs his henchmen to grab Peter]Korath: Drop it, now!
Peter Quill: Hey, cool, man. No problem. [Peter drops the orb just as the two henchman come closer to him with their guns pointed at him] No problem at all. [Korath picks up the orb]Korath: How do you know about this?Peter Quill: I don’t even know what that is. I’m just a junker, man. I was just...just checking stuff out.Korath: You don’t look like a junker. You’re wearing Ravager garb.Peter Quill: This is just an outfit, man. [to Korath’s henchmen who keep prodding him] Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.Korath: What is your name?!Peter Quill: My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude, chill out.Korath: Move!Peter Quill: Why?
Korath: Ronan may have questions for you. [Korath turns to leave]Peter Quill: Hey, you know what? There’s another name you might know me by. [Korath stops and turns back to look at Peter] Star-Lord.Korath: Who?Peter Quill: Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. [Korath shrugs in confusion] Guys?Korath: Move!Peter Quill: Ah, forget this. [Peter pulls out his guns shoots the two henchmen and Korath then just as he picks up the orb Korath rises, shoots at Peter who manages being hit, he falls to the ground puts on his helmet, his boots become like rockets and he propels himself out of the cave, he then manages to get back to his ship and take off as Korath’s henchmen shoot at his ship]


[after escaping Korath and his men, Peter nearly loses control of his ship but manages to pull it back up in time, just then a woman appears]
Bereet: Peter? What happened?
Peter Quill: Hey, uh…uh... I… [Peter tries to remember her name]
Bereet: Bereet.
Peter Quill: Bereet! Look, I’m gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you were here. [she looks at him with shock; later as they are traveling away from Morag Peter watches the news on this monitor]
News Reporter: Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today protesting the recent peace treaty signed by the Kree Emperor and Xandar’s Nova Prime.
Bereet: Peter, you have call. [Bereet presses the screen to answer the call]
Peter Quill: No, wait, don’t! [Peter’s partner, Yondu comes up on the monitor]
Yondu Udonta: Quill?
Peter Quill: Hey, Yondu.
Yondu Udonta: I’m here on Morag. Ain’t no Orb, ain’t no you.
Peter Quill: Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I’d save you the hassle.
Yondu Udonta: Well, where are you at now, boy?
Peter Quill: I feel really bad about this, but I’m not gonna tell you that.
Yondu Udonta: I slaved putting this deal together…
Peter Quill: Slaved? Making a few calls is ""slaved""?
Yondu Udonta: And now you’re gonna rip me off!
Peter Quill: I mean, really?
Yondu Udonta: We do not do that to each other. We’re Ravagers. We got a code.
Peter Quill: Yeah, and that code is ""steal from everybody.""
Yondu Udonta: When I picked you up on Terra…
Peter Quill: ""Picked me up.""
Yondu Udonta: …these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
Peter Quill: Yeah?
Yondu Udonta: They ain’t never tasted any Terran before. I stopped ‘em. You’re alive because of me! I will find you, I will… [Peter cuts him off by ending the call] [to his men, referring to Peter] Put a bounty on him! Forty K. But I want him back alive.
Kraglin: Yeah, Cap.
Horuz: Alive?
Yondu Udonta: That’s what I said.
Horuz: I told you when you picked that kid up, you should have delivered him like we was hired to do! He was cargo! You have always been soft on him.
Yondu Udonta: You’re the only one I’m being soft on! Now, don’t you worry about Mr. Quill. As soon as we get him back here, I’m gonna kill him myself. What we do need to worry about, is who else out there wants that orb!


[on the Kree Warship, the Dark Aster, Ronan is being dressed by his servants]
Ronan: They call me ""terrorist,"" ""radical,"" ""zealot,"" because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree, and punish those who do not. Because I do not forgive your people for taking the life of my father, and his father, and his father before him. A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten! [Ronan picks up a massive weapon which resembles a hammer]
Xandarian Prisoner: You can’t do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.
Ronan: My government knows no shame. You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.
Xandarian Prisoner: You will never rule Xandar.
Ronan: No. I will cure it! [Ronan suddenly uses his weapon to strike the prisoner in the head, killing him]
Nebula: Ronan, Korath has returned. [Ronan meets with Korath]
Korath: Master, he is a thief, an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord. But we have discovered he has an agreement to retrieve the orb for an intermediary known as The Broker.
Ronan: I promised Thanos I would retrieve the orb for him. Only then will he destroy Xandar for me. Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the orb.
Nebula: It will be my honor.
Gamora: It will be your doom. If this happens again, you’ll be facing our father without his prize.
Nebula: I’m a daughter of Thanos. Just like you.
Gamora: But I know Xandar.
Nebula: Ronan has already decreed that I…
Ronan: Do not speak for me. [to Gamora] You will not fail.
Gamora: Have I ever?


[on Xander, Capital of the Nova Empire, Rocket and Groot, tree-like humanoid, are spying on the Xandarians in the city]
Rocket: Xandarians. What a bunch of losers. All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to nothing at all. Pathetic. [referring to the Xandarian man with short blond hair walking on the sidewalk] Look at this guy! Can you believe they call us criminals, when he’s assaulting us with that haircut? [referring to the small Xandarian child getting help whilst walking] What is this thing? Look how it thinks it’s so cool. It’s not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle. [referring to the older Xandarian man (Stan Lee) chatting up a pretty young woman] Look at Mr. Smiles over here. Where’s your wife, old man? What a class-A prevert. [laughs] Right, Groot? Groot? [he looks over to Groot and sees he’s drinking water from the nearby fountain] Don’t drink fountain water, you idiot. That’s disgusting!
Groot: Mmm. [Groot shakes his head pretending he didn’t drink it]
Rocket: Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it. Why are you lying? [Rocket’s tablet starts beeping warning him of a human sighting] Whoop. Looks like we got one. Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you? [his tablet shows Peter talking to Bereet, Rocket sees that there’s a bounty on Peter] Forty thousand units? Groot, we’re gonna be rich. [Rockets looks over to Groot and finds him drinking from the water from fountain again, he sighs and shakes his head]


[Peter enters a shop in Xandar and is greeted by the Broker]
The Broker: Mr. Quill.
Peter Quill: Broker. The orb. [he holds out the orb and places it on the counter in front of the Broker] As commissioned.
The Broker: Where’s Yondu?
Peter Quill: Wanted to be here, sends his love. And told me to tell you, that you got the best eyebrows in the business. [the Broker picks up the orb] What is it?
The Broker: It’s my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.
Peter Quill: Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.
The Broker: An occupational hazard, I’m sure, in your line of work.
Peter Quill: Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan. [the Broker suddenly looks afraid]
The Broker: Ronan? I’m sorry, Mr. Quill. I truly am. But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved. [he gives the orb back to Peter and starts pushing him towards his shop door]
Peter Quill: Woh! Woh, woh, woh! Who’s Ronan?
The Broker: A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is wiped from existence! [the Brokers starts pushing Peter again]
Peter Quill: Woh. Come on!
The Broker: He’s someone whose bad side I’d rather not be on.
Peter Quill: What? What about my bad side? [the Broker opens his shop door and pushes Peter out]
The Broker: Farewell, Mr. Quill. [he closes the door in Peter’s face]
Peter Quill: [shouting to the Broker through his closed shop door] Hey, we had a deal, bro! [as he steps back he notices Gamora standing nearby watching him]
Gamora: What happened?
Peter Quill: Uh...this guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity. Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.
Gamora: You have the bearing of a man of honor. [Peter starts to playfully throw the orb up and down in his hand]
Peter Quill: Well, you know, I wouldn't say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it's not something I would ever say about myself. [suddenly Gamora grabs the orb, kicks Peter in his stomach and runs off, Peter throws something like a magnetic rope which catches around Gamora's legs and trips her up, as she gets the rope off her legs Peter catches up to her but Gamora manages to kick him off and starts punching him, she holds up her knife ready to stab him]
Gamora: This wasn't the plan. [as she's about to stab Peter, Rocket jumps on to her and knocks her down; to Groot referring to Peter]
Rocket: Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag! [Groot extends his roots and goes to grab Gamora] No! Not her, him! Learn genders, man. [as he struggles with Gamora she tries to bite him] Biting? That's not fair! [as Rocket is fighting with Gamora, Peter uses this opportunity to grab the orb and runs off] [as Rocket struggles to hold Gamora] Take it easy! [Gamora manages to free herself from Rocket and Groot's clutches, she throws Rockets aside, picks up a piece of metal, throws it at Peter's hand making him drop the orb, she grabs and as she runs off Peter jumps on to her and knocks her down but Gamora overpowers him again and hold Peter down]
Gamora: Fool. You should have learned.
Peter Quill: I don't learn. One of my issues. [Peter grabs the orb from her hand, attaches small rocket launcher on Gamora and sets it off throwing Gamora aside, thinking he's in the clear suddenly Groot places a bag over Peter's head] What the... [Groot starts carrying Peter in the bag over his shoulder]
Rocket: Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional. [just then he sees Gamora coming towards them] You gotta be kidding me. [she pushes Rocket aside] Hey! [Gamora fights with Groot, cutting off his arms, as she opens the bag Peter suddenly uses his gun to electrocute her and runs off, Rocket gets out his gun and aims it at Peter] I live for the simple things. Like how much this is gonna hurt. [he shoots his gun which shoots a ball of electricity at Peter giving him an electric shock] Yeah. Writhe, little man. [he looks at Groot who is looking sadly as his severed arms] It'll grow back, you D'ast idiot. Quit whining. [just then they are captured by The Nova Corps]
Nova Arresting Pilot: Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.
Rocket: Oh, crap. [Rockets reluctantly drops his weapon]
Nova Arresting Pilot: By the authority of the Nova Corps, you are under arrest... [at the same time Peter is being arrested]
Corpsman Dey: Alright. Come on up.
Nova Arresting Pilot: ...for endangerment to life and the destruction of property. [as Dey arrests Peter he recognizes him]
Corpsman Dey: Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.
Peter Quill: Star-Lord.
Corpsman Dey: Oh, sorry. Lord. [to his partner] I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft. He's got a code name.
Peter Quill: Come on, man. It's a...it's an outlaw name.
Corpsman Dey: Just relax, pal. It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird. [referring to the Nova Corps]
Rocket: Fascists. [we see as Rocket, Groot and an unconscious Gamora are arrested]


[at Nova Headquarters, Xandar’s Armed Forces, Nova Prime is on call to the Kree Ambassador]
Nova Prime: Ronan is destroying Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree.
Kree Ambassador: We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want?
Nova Prime: At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering children, families.
Kree Ambassador: That is your business. Now, I have other matters to attend to. [he ends the call]
Nova Prime: Prick.
Denarian Saal: Well, some good news. Looks like we’ve apprehended one of Ronan’s compatriots. [after all four have been captured and taken to Nova Headquarters, Dey presents each of them to Saal]
Corpsman Dey: Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos. Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together. [next it’s Rocket] Subject 89P13. Calls itself Rocket. The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form. [referring to Groot]
Denarian Saal: What the hell?
Corpsman Dey: They call it Groot. A humanoid plant that’s been traveling recently as 89P13’s personal house plant slash muscle. [next up is Peter] Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led by Yondu Udonta.
Peter Quill: [Quill winds up his middle finger and flips the bird at them] Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know how this machine worked.
Denarian Saal: What a bunch of a-holes. [Dey smiles] Transport all four to the Kyln.


 Incomplete 
[as the four of them are taken to The Kyln, High Security Prison]
Rocket: I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel. But, hey, that's not my problem. I ain't gonna be here long. I've escaped 22 prisons, this one's no different. You're lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting that bounty right now, and you'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.
Peter Quill: I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.
Prison Guard: Hold.
Rocket: What's a raccoon?
Peter Quill: ""What's a raccoon?"" It's what you are, stupid.
Rocket: Ain't no thing like me, except me. [as they are being led to their cell]
Peter Quill: So, this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is it?
Groot: I am Groot.
Peter Quill: So what? What's the Orb?
Gamora: I have no words for an honorless thief.
Rocket: Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. [Gamora looks at Rocket] Yeah, I know who you are. Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
Peter Quill: Yeah, we know who you are. [to Groot] Who is she? (Groot: I am Groot.) Yeah, you said that.
Gamora: I wasn't retrieving the orb for Ronan, I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.
Groot: I am Groot.
Peter Quill: Well, that’s just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told that. What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?
Rocket: Well, he don’t know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to “I” and “am” and “Groot”. Exclusively in that order.
Peter Quill: I tell you what, that’s gonna wear real thin, real fast. [Peter sees a Prison Guard with his Walkman headphones] Hey. Put that away. [he walks inside the room towards the Guard as the door closes] Hey! Listen to me you big blue bastard, take those headphones off, that's mine. Those belong to impound, that tape and that player is mine! [the guard stuns Peter with a stun baton] Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973, that song belongs to me! [the guard stuns him again, as Hooked on a Feeling starts playing, the guards stuns Peter again ''as the camera pans offscreen.]

I have a plan! I have a plan!
Drax: Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.
Peter Quill: Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.
Drax: Do not ever call me a thesaurus.
Peter Quill: It's just a metaphor, dude.
Rocket: His people are completely literal, metaphors are gonna go over his head.
Drax: Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.
Gamora: I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy. [as the prison guards surround the watchtower carrying large weapons]
Peter Quill: Those are some big guns.
Head Riot Guard: [to the guards] On my command! Number one! [one of the guards shoots his weapon which hits one of the watchtower glass windows]
Gamora: Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
Rocket: Hold on!
Head Riot Guard: Number two! [another guard shoots his weapon which hits the other side of the watchtower; referring to Rocket]
Drax: I recognize this animal. We'd roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.
Rocket: Not helping!
Head Riot Guard: [to the guards] Number three! [another shoots their weapon which hits another glass window of the watchtower leaving a massive crack] All fire on my command! [Rocket works as fast as he can to save them] Three! Two! One! [just then Rocket rigs to turn off the gravity making everyone in the prison start floating]
Gamora: You turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.
Rocket: I told you I had a plan. [Rocket disconnects the watchtower from its base, then uses the security droids to attack to the base of it and uses the droids jets to fly the watchtower out of the prison]
Peter Quill: That was a pretty good plan. [they get out of the watchtower, the others go grab their personal stuff and Peter looks for his spaceship] Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.
Rocket: They crumpled my pants up into a ball. That's rude! They folded yours. [Peter then gets his personal stuff and looks through it, we see the orb on one of his bags]
Gamora: The orb's there. Let's go!
Peter Quill: Wait, wait, wait. [Peter keeps searching for his Walkman in his stuff]
Gamora: What?
Peter Quill: That bastard didn't put it back.
Gamora: Put what back? [Peter gives the bag containing the orb to Gamora]
Peter Quill: Here. Get them to the ship, I will be right back.
Gamora: How are you gonna possibly...
Peter Quill: Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go! [Peter runs off] [Peter attacks the prison guards using his weapon taking each one down one by one]
Prison Guard: Ow! My neck! [Peter shoots him again as he walks past him, at the same time the others have boarded the Milano and are waiting for Peter]
Rocket: Well, how's he gonna get to us?
Gamora: He declined to share that information with me.
Rocket: Well, screw this, then! I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish. You got the orb, right?
Gamora: Yes. [Gamora looks in the bag that Peter gave her and finds the orb is missing, we see Peter has kept the orb and is throwing it up and down in his hand as he goes to get his Walkman from the guard that took it, he uses the orb to bash the guard over the head; back on the Milano]
Rocket: If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.
Gamora: No! We're not leaving without the orb. [just then Drax notices Peter flying towards them]
Drax: Behold. [as they help Peter board onto the Milano] This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan. [to Peter] Companion, what were you retrieving? [Peter gives him the Walkman] You're an imbecile. [as they are flying off in the Milano, Peter finds Rocket taking apart parts of the ship]
Peter Quill: Woh, woh, woh! Yoh, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can't take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is this?
Rocket: Don't touch that, it's a bomb.
Peter Quill: A bomb?
Rocket: Yep.
Peter Quill: And you leave it lying around?
Rocket: I was gonna put it in a box.
Peter Quill: What's a box gonna do? [Rocket pulls out a box and takes out the wrapped present Peter's mother had given him before she had died]
Rocket: How about this one?
Peter Quill: No! Woh! Hey! Hey! Leave it alone!
Rocket: Why? What is it?
Peter Quill: Shut up.
Rocket: Hey! [pointing to something else Rocket had pulled out of the ship]
Peter Quill: What is that?
Rocket: That's for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.
Gamora: No one's blowing up moons.
Rocket: You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.
Peter Quill: So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.
Gamora: We're heading in the right direction, for now. [Gamora picks up the orb]
Peter Quill: If we're gonna work together, you might want to try trusting me a little bit.
Gamora: And how much do you trust me? [he takes the orb out of Gamora's hand]
Peter Quill: I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.
Gamora: I don't know what it is. [Peter places the orb on the table and Drax picks it up]
Drax: If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.
Gamora: Put it down, you fool! You'll destroy us all.
Drax: Or just you, murderess!
Gamora: I let you live once, princess!
Drax: I am not a princess!
Peter Quill: Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money. [Drax throws the orb to Peter]
Drax: If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.
Gamora: Put it down, you fool! You'll destroy us all.
Drax: Or just you, murderess!
Gamora: I let you live once, princess!
Drax: I am not a princess!
Peter Quill: Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money. [Drax throws the orb to Peter]
Drax: I have no interest in money. [Drax walks off]
Peter Quill: Great. That means more money for the three of us. [Groot makes a noise indicating he counts too] For the four of us. Partners.
Gamora: We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I'll tell the buyer we're on our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy. [she turns and walks up the stairs]
Peter Quill: Oh, she has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.
Rocket: You got issues, Quill. [Ronan and Nebula are at the The Kyln torturing one of the prison guards]
Head Riot Guard: I swear, I don't know where they went! I swear!
Nebula: If he knew where they were headed, he'd have already told us.
Head Riot Guard: Yeah.
Nebula: Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison. Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant. Find the orb. Any means, any price.
Nebula: And this place?
Ronan: The Nova can't know what we're after. Cleanse it! [Yondu pays a visit to the Broker to find out what Peter has done with the orb]
Yondu Udonta: Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one? I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.
The Broker: I can't tell if you're joking or not.
Kraglin: He's being fully serious.
The Broker: In that case, I can show you... [Yondu laughs]
Yondu Udonta: But first, you gonna tell me what this orb is, and why everybody cares so damn much about it. And then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it.
The Broker: Sir, the high-end community is a... [Yondu interrupts and mocks him by speaking gibberish] The high-end community is a... [Yondu continues to talk gibberish over the Broker] It's a tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again with more gibberish] Tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again] The high-end community is a very tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again talking gibberish making Kraglin laugh] I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers! [Yondu threatens him by making his arrow float and hover towards the Broker's face]
Yondu Udonta: Now, who again is this buyer of yours? [on the Collector's ship]
The Collector: Carina.
Carina: Yes, Master.
The Collector: Your people do have elbows, do they not?
Carina: We do, Master.
The Collector: Then use them. I don't have to remind you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me. Do I? [Carina fearfully looks at the previous servant who is now locked up in one of the glass cells on the Collector's ship] Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon. [Carina quickly goes back to cleaning the glass cells] [back on the Milano]
Rocket: Heads up! We're inbound. [they all watch as they head towards Knowhere which looks like a giant severed-head]
Peter Quill: Woh.
Drax: What is it?
Gamora: It's called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent. There are no regulations whatsoever here. [we see the Milano enter Knowhere, Mining Colony] Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull. The bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy. It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws. [we see the group walking around in the streets of Knowhere]
Peter Quill: Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde and John Stamos.
Drax: It sounds like a place which I would like to visit.
Peter Quill: Yeah, you should. [a bunch of kids surround them]
Knowhere Kid: Excuse me.
Peter Quill: [to the others] Watch your wallets.
Knowhere Kid: Can you spare any units?
Rocket: Get out of here. [a girl walks up to Groot, he grows a flower in his hand, plucks it and gives it to her before walking off] [as they walk towards a bar] Your buyer's in there?
Gamora: We are to wait here for his representative. [we see a bouncer throws a patron out of the bar]
Bar Bouncer: Get out of here!
Drax: This is no respectable establishment. What do you expect us to do while we wait? [while they wait for their appointment, Drax, Rocket and Groot get drunk and gamble] Yes! Yes!
Rocket: Yahoo!
Drax: My Orloni has won, as I win at all things! Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.
Rocket: That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy! [at the same time Peter and Gamora are on the balcony of the bar]
Peter Quill: Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this job.
Gamora: My connection is making us wait.
Peter Quill: It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, ""Stab, stab. Those are my terms."" [Gamora smiles]
Gamora: My father didn't stress diplomacy.
Peter Quill: Thanos?
Gamora: He's not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan, I...I couldn't stand by and... [she notices Peter's Walkman on his belt and takes it] Why would you risk your life for this?
Peter Quill: My mother gave it to me. My mom liked to share with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up. I happened to have it on me when I was...the day that she... You know, when I left Earth. [Peter takes the Walkman from Gamora and puts it back on his belt]
Gamora: What do you do with it?
Peter Quill: Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.
Gamora: I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.
Peter Quill: Really? Well, on my planet, there's a legend about people like you. It's called ""Footloose."" And in it, a great hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...it's the greatest thing there is.
Gamora: Who put the sticks up their butts?
Peter Quill: What? No, that's just a...
Gamora: That is cruel.
Peter Quill: It's just a phrase people use. [Peter puts the Walkman headphones onto Gamora's head so she can listen to the music, after listening for a moment she speaks out loud]
Gamora: The melody is pleasant! [as Gamora listens to the music Peter's leans in to kiss her when suddenly Gamora puts a knife to his throat] No!
Peter Quill: Ow! What the hell?
Gamora: I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...your pelvic sorcery!
Peter Quill: That is not what is happening here. [as Gamora lets go of his throat Peter notices Drax, Rocket and Groot are all fighting inside the bar] Oh, no. [Peter and Gamora enter the bar to stop the fight between Drax, Rocket and Groot, Gamora drags Drax off of Groot]
Gamora: Stop it! [Rocket points his weapon at Drax as he's about to shoot Peter intervenes]
Peter Quill: Woh! Woh! What are you doing?
Drax: This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!

Rocket: That is true!

Drax: He has no respect!
Rocket: That is also true!
Peter Quill: Hold on! Hold on!
Rocket: Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!
Peter Quill: Rocket, you're drunk. Alright? No one's laughing at you.
Rocket: He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does! Well, I didn't ask to get made! I didn't ask to be torn apart, and put back together, over and over and turned into some...some little monster!
Peter Quill: Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.
Rocket: He called me vermin! She called me rodent! Let's see if you can laugh after five or six good shots to your frickin' face! [as Rocket points his weapon at Drax again Peter stands in front of him]
Peter Quill: No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you're rich. [Rocket hesitates for a moment then lowers his weapon]
Rocket: Fine. But I can't promise when all this is over I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.
Peter Quill: See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're already trying to kill them!
Drax: We have traveled halfway across the quadrant, and Ronan is no closer to being dead. [Drax turns and leaves in anger]
Peter Quill: Drax!
Gamora: Let him go. We don't need him. [just then the Collector's assistant, Carina, enters the bar]
Carina: Milady Gamora, I'm here to fetch you for my master. [Carina escorts them to the Collector's home]
Rocket: Okay, this isn't creepy at all.
Carina: We house the galaxy's largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manner. [she takes them to the Collectors massive room of collections where he's waiting for them] I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector. [Gamora and the Collector walk towards each other]
The Collector: Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh. [he kisses her hand]
Gamora: Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed. [as the Collector notices Groot]
The Collector: What is that thing there?
Groot: I am Groot. [the Collector goes over to Groot]
The Collector: I never thought I'd meet a Groot. Sir, you must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of course.
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?
The Collector: [to Groot] That's your pet?
Rocket: His what?! [Rocket goes to grab his weapon and the Collector chuckles, Gamora intervenes]
Gamora: Tivan, we have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this orb.
The Collector: Very well, then. Let us see what you brought. [Gamora looks at Peter, he retrieves the orb from his bag but accidentally drops it, he quickly picks it up to show the Collector] [meanwhile a drunken Drax notices a man making a call in a booth]
Knowhere Civilian: Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me... [suddenly Drax comes up from behind and holds a knife against his throat]
Drax: You shall send a message for me. [back with the Collector and the group]
The Collector: Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. [he uses a device to unlock and open the orb] Then the universe exploded into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe. [he shows them the giant beings that use the Infinity Stones as weapons] These carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.
Peter Quill: There's a little pee coming out of me right now.
The Collector: Once, for a moment, a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were quickly destroyed by it. [the orb is opened to reveal an Infinity Stone] Beautiful. Beyond compare.
Rocket: Blah, blah, blah. We're all very fascinated, whitey. But we'd like to get paid.
The Collector: How would you like to get paid?
Rocket: What do you think, fancy man? Units!
The Collector: Very well, then. [as the Collector goes to get the money, Carina, fascinated by the Infinity Stone, walks towards it] Carina. Stand back.
Carina: I will no longer be your slave!
The Collector: No! [Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that destroys herself as well the Collectors archive, Groot grabs Rocket and runs out of the place as it explodes; Peter and Gamora come out from under the table to look at the destruction caused by the explosion]
Peter Quill: What the fff...? [Gamora grabs the orb and locks it back up to contain the Infinity Stone as they leave the Collector's place]
Gamora: How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the orb?
Rocket: What do you still have it for?
Peter Quill: Well what are we gonna do, leave it in there?
Rocket: I can't believe you had that in your purse!
Peter Quill: It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!
Gamora: We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There's a chance they can contain it.
Rocket: Are you kidding me? We're wanted by the Nova Corps! Just give it to Ronan!
Peter Quill: So he can destroy the galaxy?
Rocket: What are you, some Saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?
Peter Quill: Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!
Gamora: Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the stone to fall into Ronan's hands. We have to go back to your ship and deliver it to Nova.
Peter Quill: Right, right, okay. I think you're right. Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us, who's really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it's a really good balance between both of your points of view.
Gamora: You're despicable.
Peter Quill: I...
Gamora: Dishonorable. Faithless! [Gamora turns and starts to walk off when she notices Ronan and his crew arriving in their ships] Oh, no.
Drax: At last! I shall meet my foe and destroy him.
Peter Quill: You called Ronan? [just as Ronan's ships are landing Yondu and his men turn up too]
Yondu Udonta: Quill! Don't you move, boy! [Peter and Gamora make a run for it] Don't you move! Get out of the way! [Yondu chases after them, at the same time Ronan steps off his ship and Drax waits for him with his knives raised]
Drax: Ronan the Accuser!
Ronan: You are the one who transmitted the message?
Drax: You killed my wife. You killed my daughter! [Gamora, Rocket and Peter find the little mining pods and go to board three of them; to Groot]
Rocket: I told you, you can't fit. Now, wait here. I'll be back. [Nebula notices the three mining pods taking off]
Nebula: It is Gamora. She is escaping with the orb. [Nebula goes back to board their ship, Ronan turns to join her]
Drax: No! [Drax runs towards Ronan he goes to strike him with his knife when Ronan easily dodges it]
Ronan: Nebula, retrieve the orb. [as Nebula takes off on the ship, Ronan stays behind to fight with Drax] [as Nebula is chasing after the three mining pods containing Rocket, Peter and Gamora]
Nebula: The stone is in the furthest pod. Bring it down! [Nebula chases Gamora's ship, at the same time Drax continues his battle with Ronan; as Nebula chases after Gamora Peter takes his pod over to Rocket's]
Peter Quill: Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.
Rocket: How? We've got no weaponry on these things.
Peter Quill: These pods are industrial grade, they're nearly indestructible.
Rocket: Not against necroblasts, they're not.
Peter Quill: That's not what I'm saying.
Rocket: Oh! [Rocket takes his pod over to the two ships chasing them, he crashes into each one destroying them both, then as another one comes over to shoot at his pod, Rocket flies straight into it making it explode, Peter then hijacks one of the ships chasing them]
Peter Quill: Let me borrow your ride. [Ronan and Drax continue their battle with Ronan beating Drax and holding him down by his throat]
Ronan: I don't recall killing your family. I doubt I'll remember killing you, either. [at the same time Nebula and her crew continue chasing after Gamora]
Gamora: Quill, I'm trapped! I can't make it to the Milano, I have to head out.
Peter Quill: What? Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there. [Gamora takes her pod above the atmosphere with Nebula chasing after her]
Nebula: You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hated you least.
Gamora: Nebula, please. If Ronan gets this stone he'll kill us all.
Nebula: Not all. You will already be dead. [Nebula blows up Gamora's ship leaving Gamora floating in space and taking the Infinity Stone] [we see Ronan dragging and unconscious Drax on the ground and then throwing him into a tub of yellow liquid]
Nebula: Ronan, it is done. [at the same time Peter and Rocket watch Gamora's body as it floats in the atmosphere]
Rocket: Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there's nothing we can do for her. These pods aren't meant to be out here. In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat. [Rocket turns his pod and starts leaving]
Peter Quill: Aw, damn it!
Rocket: Quill? [Peter reluctantly places a call]
Peter Quill: Yondu! Yondu! This is Quill! My coordinates are two-two-seven-K-three-two- four.
Rocket: Quill? Quill, what are you doing?
Peter Quill: Just outside Knowhere. If you're there, come get me. I'm all yours. [Peter then puts on his mask, exits the pod and goes over to Gamora]
Rocket: Quill, don't be ridiculous. Get back into your pod! You can't fit two people in there, you're gonna die. [Peter hold Gamora's body and starts to take off his mask] You'll die in seconds! Quill! [Peter puts his mask onto Gamora's head and she starts to breath, then Yondu's ship arrive and takes Peter and Gamora before they die] [as they enter Yondu's ship Gamora becomes conscious whilst Peter is still holding her]
Gamora: Quill? What happened?
Peter Quill: I saw you out there. I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't let you die. I found something inside of myself. Something incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but objectively... [Gamora sighs with frustration]
Gamora: Where's the orb?
Peter Quill: It's...well, they got the orb.
Gamora: What? [just then a door opens and Yondu's men enter]
Kraglin: Welcome home, Peter. [Groot saves Drax out of the yellow liquid and helps him to breath, Rocket then lands his pod right in front of them and gets out]
Rocket: Blasted idiot. They're all idiots! Quill just got himself captured! [to Drax] None of this ever would have happened if you didn't try to single-handedly take on a frickin' army!
Rocket: Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. ""My wife and child are dead."" [Groot gasps in shock at Rocket's callousness] Oh, I don't care if it's mean! Everybody's got dead people! That's no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way! Come on, Groot. Ronan has the stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there. [Groot rises to his feet in defiance]
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: Save them? How?
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: I know they're the only friends that we ever had, but there's an army of Ravagers around them. And there's only two of us! [Drax rises and stands next to Groot]
Drax: Three. [Rocket grunts in anger and frustration, turns and starts kicking the ground with his feet]
Rocket: Aw! You're making me beat up grass! [back on board the Dark Astor Ronan contacts Thanos]
Ronan: The orb is in my possession, as I promised. [Korath holds up the orb in his hand]
Thanos: Bring it to me.
Ronan: Yes, that was our agreement. [Ronan takes the orb from Korath] Bring you the orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.
Thanos: Boy, I would reconsider your current course. [Ronan opens up the orb and looks at the Infinity Stone inside]
Korath: Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
Ronan: Not anymore. [suddenly Ronan embeds the Infinity Stone in his warhammer and absorbs its power into his body] You call me ""boy!"" I will unfurl one thousand years of Kree justice on Xandar, and burn it to its core! Then, Thanos, I'm coming for you. [he ends his call to Thanos]
Nebula: After Xandar, you're going to kill my father?
Ronan: You dare to oppose me?
Nebula: You see what he has turned me into. You kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets. [on Yondu's ship, Yondu is beating Peter who's being held by Yondu's men]
Yondu Udonta: You betrayed me! Steal my money!
Gamora: Stop it! Leave him alone!
Yondu Udonta: When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted Terran before. I saved your life!
Peter Quill: Oh, will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you've been throwing that in my face, like it's some great thing, not eating me! Normal people don't even think about eating someone else! Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my home and from my family.
Yondu Udonta: You don't give a damn about your Terra! You're scared because you're soft, in here. [he beats his chest] Here! Right here! [Yondu grabs Peter again to hit him]
Gamora: Yondu! Listen to me! Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.
Yondu Udonta: I know what he's got, girl.
Gamora: Then you know we must get it back! He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar. We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.
Yondu Udonta: [to Peter, referring to Gamora] Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy? Sentiment? [he slaps Peter and his men laugh] Eating away your brain like maggots! That's it. [he whistles commanding his weapon fly over to point at Peter's throat]
Gamora: No!
Yondu Udonta: Sorry, boy. But a captain's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.
Kraglin: Captain's gotta teach stuff! [the others grunt in agreement]
Peter Quill: If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen. [Yondu smiles and turns to face Peter]
Yondu Udonta: The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.
Peter Quill: We got a ringer.
Yondu Udonta: Is that right?
Peter Quill: She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army.
Gamora: He's vulnerable.
Peter Quill: Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh? Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days. [Yondu hesitates as he thinks for a moment, then he whistles and his weapon moves from Peter's throat] [Yondu and his men start to laugh and Peter joins in]
Yondu Udonta: Let him go! Oh! You always did have a scrote, boy! That's why I kept you on as a young'un. [just then the ship shakes as it gets hit by something]
Ravager Pilot: Captain, the shot was non-damaging. [we see the Milano approaching Yondu's ship]
Rocket: Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. [we see Drax in a space suit standing on top of the Milano holding a weapon] It's a weapon of my own design.
Yondu Udonta: What the hell?
Rocket: If you don't hand over our companions now, he's gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new one!
Yondu Udonta: I ain't buyin' it.
Rocket: I'm giving you to the count of five. Five, four, three... [Peter and Gamora stop Kraglin from giving the order to blow up the Milano]
Peter Quill: No!
Gamora: No, no! Don't!
Peter Quill: No! Wait, hold on! [Peter quickly turns on the radio comm] Rocket, it's me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We're fine!
Rocket: Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on? [on board the Milano after Peter's explained his plan to the group] You call that ""figured it out""? We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.
Peter Quill: Oh, you want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?
Rocket: We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!
Peter Quill: And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?
Rocket: Well we didn't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically!
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: They are ungrateful.
Gamora: What's important now is we get the Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.
Rocket: So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?
Peter Quill: We'll figure that part out later.
Gamora: We have to stop Ronan.
Rocket: How?
Peter Quill: I have a plan.
Rocket: You've got a plan?
Peter Quill: Yes.
Rocket: First of all, you're copying me from when I said I had a plan.
Peter Quill: No, I'm not. People say that all the time, it's not that unique of a thing to say.
Rocket: Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.
Peter Quill: I have part of a plan!
Drax: What percentage of a plan do you have?
Gamora: You don't get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.
Drax: I just saved Quill.
Peter Quill: We've already established that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.
Drax: When did we establish it?

Peter Quill: Like three seconds ago!

Drax: I wasn't listening, I was thinking of something else.
Gamora: [in frustration] Oh!
Rocket: She's right, you don't get an opinion. [to Peter] What percentage?
Peter Quill: I don't know, twelve percent.
Rocket: Twelve percent? [Rocket laughs out loud]
Peter Quill: That's a fake laugh.
Rocket: It's real!
Peter Quill: Totally fake.
Rocket: That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan.
Gamora: It's barely a concept.
Peter Quill: You're taking their side?
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: So what, it's better than eleven percent? What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Peter Quill: Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue. [Peter turns to see Groot starting to chew on a leaf protruding from his shoulder, Peter shakes his head and Rocket chuckles] Guys. Come on. Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around at us, you know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we have. All of us. Our homes, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more than it gives, but not today. Today, it's given us something. It has given us a chance.
Drax: To do what?
Peter Quill: To give a shit. For once, not run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.
Rocket: But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it's impossible. You're asking us to die.
Peter Quill: Yeah, I guess I am. I... [Peter turns his back to the group in defeat]
Gamora: Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. [Gamora rises to her feet] I will be grateful to die among my friends. [Drax rises to his feet]
Drax: You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, see my wife and daughter again. [Groot rises next]
Groot: I am Groot. [they all then look at Rocket, who finally sighs and gives in]
Rocket: Oh, what the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway. [Rocket also rises and stands on his seat] Now I'm standing. You all happy? We're all standing up now. Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle. [as they start to plan to take back the stone from Ronan]
Gamora: The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.
Peter Quill: All Ronan's gotta do is touch the stone to the planet's surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova Corps.
Gamora: Everything will die.
Peter Quill: So Ronan does not make the surface. Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster's starboard hull. Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.
Kraglin: Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?
Drax: I think of Sakaaran as paper people. [Kraglin smiles and gives Drax a friendly punch on the shoulder, but Drax, not understanding the playful jester, gives Kraglin a look like he's going to hit him]
Gamora: Once they know we're on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.
Peter Quill: We'll make it to the flight deck, and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.
Gamora: Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone. Use these devices to contain it. [the devices are passed out] If you touch it, it will kill you.
Peter Quill: I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help. [we see Peter contacting Dey]
Rocket: There's one more thing we need to complete the plan. [he points to one of Yondu's men who has one robotic eye] That guy's eye...
Peter Quill: No! No, we don't. No, we don't need that guy's eye.
Rocket: No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.
Ravager Navigator: Ronan's fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in t-minus fifteen minutes.
Yondu Udonta: [to Peter] Remember, boy. At the end of all this, I get the stone. You cross me, we kill you all. [after getting ready, Peter and the rest the group start walking along the ship] Let's go get 'em, boys! [Yondu's men leave on their ship; on the Milano]
Gamora: This is a terrible plan.
Peter Quill: Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends. [at Nova Headquarters, Dey approaches Nova Prime]
Corpsman Dey: Nova Prime. I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers. He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone and he's headed toward Xandar.
Nova Prime: Good God.
Denarian Saal: It's a trick. He's a criminal.
Nova Prime: Did he say why we should believe him?
Corpsman Dey: He said his crew just escaped from prison so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help. He says that he's an ""a-hole."" But he's not, and I'm quoting him here, ""one hundred percent a dick.""
Nova Prime: Do you believe him?
Corpsman Dey: Well, I don't know that I believe anyone's one hundred percent a dick, ma'am.
Nova Prime: I mean, do you believe that he's here to help? [Dey hesitates a moment before replying]
Corpsman Dey: Yeah. [on board the Dark Astor; to Ronan]
Nebula: A fleet approaches, they appear to be Ravagers. [the Ravagers fleet of ship stop near the Dark Astor]
Yondu Udonta: Fire! [the ships fire at the Dark Astor and the explosion bounces off the ship forming a cloud of fire] Cover it down! Submerge! [the ships, including the Milano duck beneath the wall of fire and go beneath the Dark Astor]
Peter Quill: Rocket, hurry! [to the crew on Dark Astor]
Nebula: All pilots, dive! They're beneath us! [at Nova Headquarters]
Nova Prime: Evacuate the city. Our priority is to get our people away from the battle. [to her crew as the Ravegers ships and the Milano are firing at the Dark Astor]
Nebula: Forward thrust, now!
Kraglin: Come on! [after they've managed to blow a hole in the Dark Astor]
Rocket: Quill! Yondu! Now! [Yondu's ship is shot down]
Yondu Udonta: Aw, hell! I'm going down, Quill! No more games with me, boy! I'll see you at the end of this! [referring to the fleet of Ronan's ships firing at them]
Gamora: There are too many of them, Rocket! We'll never make it up there! [just then they notice Nova Corps ships joining them]
Denarian Saal: Peter Quill, this is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you here.
Peter Quill: They got my ""dick"" message!
Denarian Saal: Prove me wrong. [with the help of the Nova ships the Peter lands their ship inside the Dark Astor through the whole that was shot through it]
Drax: Yes! [Drax laughs as they crash land inside the Dark Astor] Yes!
Gamora: [to Peter] We're just like Kevin Bacon.
Nebula: [to Ronan] The starboard kern has been breached! We have been boarded!
Ronan: Continue our approach.
Nebula: But the Nova Corps have engaged!
Ronan: None of that will matter once we reach the surface. [turning to the guards]
Nebula: Seal security doors! Now! [to the guards as she walks out of Ronan's chambers] Get out of my way! [Rocket looks up from ship at the Dark Astor who is being attacked by the Nova ships]
Rocket: Oh, man.
Nova Prime: All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade. The Dark Aster must not reach the ground. [the Nova ships start to form a giant net]
Nova Pilot #1: Locked in!
Nova Pilot #2: Locked in. We're locked in. [Nova ships capture the Dark Astor in their giant net shape form; inside the ship Peter and the rest of the group leave their ship and make their way through the Dark Astor]
Drax: I can barely see. [Groot releases glowing particles from his body to light their way] When did you learn to do that?
Peter Quill: I'm pretty sure the answer is ""I am Groot.""
Gamora: The flight deck is three hundred meters this way.
Drax: I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend.
Peter Quill: Thanks.
Drax: This dumb tree, he is my friend.
Groot: Mmm.
Drax: And this green whore, she, too...
Gamora: Oh, you must stop! [Nebula intercepts their progress across the Dark Astor]
Nebula: Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak. You stupid, traitorous... [suddenly Drax a fires a shot at Nebula sending her flying off]
Drax: Nobody talks to my friends like that.
Gamora: Head to the flight deck. I'll shut down the power to the security doors. [back down on Xandar after crash landing his ship, Yondu is surrounded by Ronan's army]
Maskless Sakaaran: Yondu Udonta. Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps. [Yondu starts whistling which activates his arrow weapon to start floating up] Enough nonsense, Ravager! Time to die... [Yondu whistles again setting of his arrow which kills the entire platoon] [Gamora comes across Nebula as she rises pulling her cracked bones into place]
Gamora: Nebula, please. [Gamora and Nebula start battling it out as Gamora tries to shut down the power to the security doors]
Ronan: Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots, enact immolation initiative.
Nova Pilot: They're dive-bombing the city! Denarian Saal, should we break formation?
Denarian Saal: No! Hold your positions! [Ronan's ships start attacking Xandar]
Rocket': Keep Ronan up there, Saal. We'll take care of the people down here.
Denarian Saal: I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster. [back on the Dark Astor Peter and the rest of the group are intercepted by Korath and Ronan's crew]
Korath: Star-lord.
Peter Quill: Finally. [they all start battling it out] You thief! [as everyone is battling it out, Korath throws Drax aside]
Korath: You will never make it to Ronan. [on Xandar; ordering Yondu's men]
Rocket: Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground. [Rocket and Yondu's men start shooting at Ronan's men in their ships; back on Dark Astor Gamora and Nebula continue to battle it out]
Gamora: Come on! [at the same time Peter and the rest of the group continue their battle with Korath and Ronan's crew, Drax manages to grab of hold of Korath and starts taking out part of his head]
Drax: Finger to the throat means death. [he kills Korath and Peter walks over to Drax] Metaphor.
Peter Quill: Yeah, sorta. [suddenly more of Ronan's crew come after them] Oh, no. [Groot saves them by skewering a bunch of the goons, then whipping them around to take out the rest, after which he turns to Peter and Drax and smiles] [on the Dark Astor Ronan gives a speech which is heard back at Nova Corps headquarters]
Ronan: Xandar, you stand accused. Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on which you burn! [Ronan activates the Infinity Stone which sets off burning a fire through the Dark Astor and destroying the Nova Crops ships that are attacking including Saal's ship]
Denarian Saal: Rocket!
Rocket: Hold on, Saal, just... [Rocket watches as the fire destroys Saal's ship and the other Nova Corps ships] Quill, you gotta hurry. The city's been evacuated, but we're getting our asses kicked down here. [back on the Dark Astor, Peter continues to fight off Ronan's men as he makes his way to the bridge]
Peter Quill: Gamora hasn't opened the door! [Gamora and Nebula continue to battle it out, Gamora manages to kick Nebula which throws her off the side of the ship, her arm catches something and she hangs off the edge, Gamora goes to help her]
Gamora: Nebula! Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know he's crazy!
Nebula: I know you're both crazy. [Nebula cuts off her own hand falls]
Gamora: No! [Nebula lands on a Ravager ship and smashes the window]
Ravager Pilot: What the...?
Nebula: Get out! [she throws the Ravager pilot off the ship] [Gamora opens the bridge's door and she along with Peter, Drax and Groot enter and Peter shoots Ronan with Rocket's super cannon]
Drax: You did it! [suddenly Ronan rises and uses the power of his warhammer to throw the group aside, Drax rushes towards Ronan but Ronan grabs him by the throat and holds him up]
Ronan: I was mistaken, I do remember your family. Their screams were pitiful. I... [Rocket crashes the Milano into the bridge and seemingly destroys Ronan, the group then huddles together as the ship starts to plummet, Groot forms a giant nest around the group to keep them shielded]
Rocket: No, groot! You can't, you'll die. Why are you doing this? Why?
Groot: We are Groot. [the ship then crashes] [everyone in the group has survived the crash except Groot, who is now a pile of twigs strewn all about, Rocket holds a bunch of the twigs in his hand in sadness]
Rocket: I called him an idiot. [just then Ronan emerges from the ship's wreckage, Rocket turns to face him] You killed Groot! [Rocket rushes towards Ronan who uses his warhammer power to throw Rocket aside]
Ronan: Behold! You're Guardians of the Galaxy! What fruit have they wrought? Only that my father and his father shall finally know vengeance. People of Xandar, the time has come to rejoice and renounce your paltry gods! Your salvation is at hand. [as Ronan prepares to use his power to destroy Xandar Peter stands up to and starts singing ""Ooh-ooh Child""]
Peter Quill: ""Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter."" [to Ronan] Listen to these words. [he starts singing again] ""Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter."" Now bring it down hard! [he starts dancing as he continues to sing] ""Some day, we'll get it together and we'll get it...""
Ronan: What are you doing?
Peter Quill: Dance-off, bro. Me and you. [as Peter dances he holds his hand out to Gamora] Gamora. [Gamora shakes her head] Subtle. Take it back. [Peter continues to dance]
Ronan: What are you doing?
Peter Quill: I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom. [Rocket and Drax appear beside Ronan who use the super cannon to destroy the warhammer which frees the Infinity Stone, both Ronan and Peter go to grab it]
Gamora: No! [Peter grabs the stone which then begins to destroy him] Peter! Take my hand! [as Peter turns to Gamora he has flash back to when his mother asked him to take her hand on her death bed]
Meredith Quill: Take my hand, Peter.
Peter Quill: Mom.
Gamora: Take my hand! [with tears in his eyes Peter takes Gamora's hand, Drax then grabs his other hand and Rocket grabs Drax's hand, the power from the stone spread between the four of them]
Ronan: You're mortal! How?
Peter Quill: You said it yourself, bitch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy. [together with the power of the stone they destroy Ronan and Gamora uses the orb to contain the stone] [after destroying Ronan and containing the stone in the orb, Peter turns to look at Gamora, at the same time Yondu and his men show up]
Yondu Udonta: Well, well, well. Quite the light show. [he chuckles] Ain't this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before all the nookie-nookie starts.
Gamora: Peter, you can't. Peter.
Peter Quill: You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don't know who you're selling this to, but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.
Yondu Udonta: I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain't one. Hand it over, son. [reluctantly Pete gives the orb to Yondu, who laughs and turns to leave with his men]
Peter Quill: Yondu. [Yondu faces Peter again] Do not open that orb. You know that, right? You've seen what it does to people. [Yondu chuckles to himself and walks off] [as Yondu and his men take off in their ship they look down and Peter]
Kraglin: Yeah, Quill turned out okay. It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad like we was hired to do.
Yondu Udonta: Yeah, that guy was a jackass. [their ship takes off; to Gamora]
Peter Quill: He's gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the orb on him. [Peter holds the orb containing the stone in his hand and Gamora chuckles]
Gamora: He was gonna kill you, Peter.
Peter Quill: Oh, I know. But he was about the only family I had.
Gamora: No. He wasn't. [Rocket is sat by Groot's pile of twigs crying when Drax sits next to him and starts stroking his head to comfort him] [Peter and the group are at the Nova Corps headquarters]
Peter Quill: Why would you even know this?
Corpsman Dey: When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.
Peter Quill: I'm not Terran?
Nova Prime: You are half Terran. Your mother was of earth. Your father, well, he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.
Gamora: That could be why you were able to hold the stone for as long as you did. [a door opens, Drax and Rocket have joined them with Rocket holding a pot with a tiny Groot planted in it]
Nova Prime: Your friends have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we'd like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.
Peter Quill: Thank you, Nova Prime.
Gamora: Thank you. [as the group follow Dey, Gamora walks next to Drax]
Gamora: Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.
Drax: Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. It's really Thanos I need to kill. [the group follow Dey outside who takes them to the restored Milano]
Corpsman Dey: We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.
Peter Quill: Wow. I… [Peter looks speechless] Thank you.
Corpsman Dey: I have a family who are alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged. However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.
Rocket: Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else?
Corpsman Dey: Well you will be arrested.
Rocket: But what if I want it more than the person who has it?
Corpsman Dey: Still illegal.
Rocket: That doesn't follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? [to Gamora who's laughing] What are you laughing at? Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman? [he starts following Gamora towards the Milano]
Drax: What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine?
Corpsman Dey: That's...that's actually murder. It's one of the worst crimes of all, so also illegal.
Drax: Hmm. [Drax starts making his way to the Milano]
Peter Quill: They'll be fine, Dey. I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.
Corpsman Dey: You?
Peter Quill: Yeah, me. [inside the Milano Peter holds the present his mother gave him before she died, he finally opens the letter and reads it]
Meredith Quill: [voice over] Peter, I know these last few months have been hard for you. But I'm going to a better place and I will be okay. And I will always be with you. You are the light of my life. My precious son. My little Star-Lord. Love, mom. [Peter opens the present and sees it's another ""Awesome Mix"" tape, he puts the tape into his ship's cassette recorder, presses play and it starts playing ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Gamora walks over to Peter and they smile at each other; we then see Yondu opening his orb to find inside it is a Troll doll, he smiles to himself; we see Dey returning home to his wife and daughter] [last lines; as Peter and the others prepare to take off, Drax smiles at Rocket who looks at the little Groot plant which starts to wake]
Peter Quill: So, what should we do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?
Gamora: We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord. [Peter smiles before replying]
Peter Quill: Bit of both!


[the Milano takes off to music from The Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back""; as the credits start to roll we see a little bit larger version of Groot dancing to the music in his pot, he stops when Drax looks at him then starts dancing again when Drax turns again]


[post-credits scene; The Collector is sitting in his destroyed archive drinking when a dog comes up and licks his face]
Howard the Duck: Why do you let it lick you like that for? [we see Howard the Duck sitting in a broken cage holding a glass of drink in his hand] Gross. [he takes a sip from his drink] Yeah! But it burns going down.

[Missouri, Earth, 1980. Meredith Quill & Ego are driving along a dirt road in Missouri singing along to ""Brandy you're a fine girl"" by Looking Glass. The two get out of the car and run into a forest.]
Meredith Quill: Where are you taking me?
Ego: Come on, come on. Look!
[Meredith spots a seedling that looks not of this Earth.]
Meredith: Oh, it’s beautiful.
Ego: I was afraid it wouldn’t take to the soil, but it grew quickly and soon, it will be everywhere, all across the universe!
Meredith: Well, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I like the way you say it.
Ego: My heart is yours, Meredith Quill.
Meredith: I can’t believe that I fell in love with a spaceman.
[They kiss]
[34 Years Later - The Sovereign, The Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter ""Star Lord"" Quill, Gamora, Drax and Rocket, stand around waiting for something big to show up.]
Peter Quill: Show time, A-holes! it will be here any minute.
Gamora: Which it will be its last.
Quill: I thought your thing was a sword?
Gamora: We’ve been hired to stop an inter-dimensional beast from feeding on those batteries and I’m going to stop it with a sword?
Quill: It’s just… swords were your thing and guns were mine, but… I guess we’re both doing guns now. I just didn’t know that.
Gamora: Drax, why aren’t you wearing one of Rocket’s Aero-Rigs?
Drax the Destroyer: It hurts.
Gamora: Hurts?
Drax: I have sensitive nipples.
Rocket Raccoon: [in a mocking tone] Wa-ha-ha-ha! My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!
Drax: What about him, what’s he doing?
Rocket: I’m finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.
Drax: How is that important?
Rocket: Blame Quill, he’s the one who loves music so much!
Quill: No, I actually agree with Drax on this, that’s hardly important right now.
Rocket: [winking] Oh, ok, sure Quill
Quill: No, seriously, I side with Drax.
Rocket: I understand that, your being very serious right now.
Drax: I can clearly see you winking!
Rocket: Damn, I’m using my left eye?
[Groot, still a baby terrorizes orloni and looks at Rocket.]
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: They were not looking at you funny. [sees the Abilisk] Oh, well that’s intense.
[While the Guardians fight off the Abilisk, Baby Groot plugs in the cord to Peter Quill's stereo and starts playing ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by ELO and begins dancing]
Quill: Groot!
Gamora: Groot, get out of the way your going to get hurt! [Baby Groot waves] Hi!
[Baby Groot continues dancing; Drax falls down next to him and every time he looks at Baby Groot, Baby Groot stops dancing. Baby Groot notices a fly buzzing around and he tries to catch it, he grabs it and puts it in his mouth.]
Rocket: No, no! Spit it out! Come on! That’s disgusting.
[Rocket removes the bug from Baby Groot's mouth. Baby Groot hops on top of an Orloni and hops around the giant Abilisk. Baby Groot jumps off the Orloni and continues dancing until Drax falls on top of Peter Quill's stereo and smashes it; Baby Groot gets angry and tries to kick Drax]
Drax: The beast’s hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside! I must cut through it from the inside.
Gamora: What? No, Drax! Drax!
Quill: What’s he doing?!
Gamora: He said that the skin is to thick to be pierced on the outside so…
Quill: That doesn’t make any sense!
Gamora: I tried telling him that!
Quill: Skin has the same level of thickness on the inside as it is on the outside!
Gamora: I realize that!
Quill: There’s a cut on its neck! Rocket, get it to look up!.
Rocket: Alright, you giant sea monkey, up here! Whoa, watch it Quill!
Drax: Yes! I have single-handily vanquished the beast! [Groot throws something in his face] What? What are they called again?
Quill: Anulax batteries.
Drax: Harbulary batteries.
Quill: That’s nothing like what I just said. But they’re worth thousands of units apiece… which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them. Careful what you say around these folks. They’re easily offended. The cost of transgression is death.
Ayesha: We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line. We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens. Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community. Impeccable, both physically and mentally. We control the DNA of our progeny… germinating them in birthing pods.
Quill: I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.
Ayesha: Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson… in the archaic ways of our ancestors. For academic purposes.
Quill: I would be honored, yes. In the name of research…I think that could be pretty, uh… [notices Gamora staring at him and he quickly changes his answer] …repulsive.I’m not into that kind of casual…
Gamora: [interrupting Peter] Oh, please. Your people promised something in exchange for our services. Bring it… and we shall gladly be on our way.
[The Sovereign guards bring a hooded figure nto the courtroom and throw her on the ground and pull back her hood, to reveal Gamora’s sister, Nebula]
Quill: Family reunion. Yay.
Ayesha: I understand she is your sister.
Gamora: She’s worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
Ayesha: Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please.
Quill: We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
Ayesha: What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
Quill: My mother is from Earth.
Ayesha: And your father?
Quill: He ain’t from Missouri. That’s all I know.
Ayesha: I see it within you. An unorthodox genealogy. A hybrid that seems particularly… reckless.
Rocket: [after hearing Ayesha insulted Peter] You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags, but that isn’t true at all. [Winks] Oh, shit. I’m using my wrong eye again, aren’t I? I’m sorry. [Drax picks Rocket up from the scruff of his vest and carries him briefly] That was meant to be behind your back. [Drax puts Rocket down]
Drax: Count yourself blessed they didn’t kill you.
Rocket: You’re telling me. [shows Drax the batteries] You wanna buy some batteries? [Drax laughs out loud but Rocket quickly shushes him. On The Milano, ""Lake Shore Drive"" plays] All right, let’s get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.
Quill: That stuff about my father… Who does she think she is?
Gamora: I know you’re sensitive about that.
Quill: I’m not sensitive about it. I just don’t know who he is. Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess. I wasn’t.
Gamora: I don’t care if you were.
Quill: Well, I feel like you do care. That’s why I’m apologizing. So, sorry!
Drax: Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Quill: Damn shadow.
Drax: There are two types of beings in the universe… those who dance, and those who do not.
Quill: Mmm-hmm.
Drax: I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Quill: Oh, God.
Drax: Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing. Except one woman. My Ovette. I knew immediately she was the one for me. The most melodic song in the world could be playing. She wouldn’t even tap her foot. Wouldn’t move a muscle. One might assume she was dead.
Quill: That does sound pretty hot.
Drax: It would make my nether regions engorge.
Quill: Okay. I get it, yes. I’m a dancer, Gamora is not.
Drax: You just need to find a woman who is pathetic… like you.
Quill: Mmm.
Nebula: I’m hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.
Gamora: No. It’s not ripe yet… and I hate you.
Nebula: You hate me? You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself. And yet here you stand, a hero. I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you. I swear.
Gamora: No. You’re gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on Xandar… wishing you could.
Quill: This is weird, we got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.
Gamora: Why would they do that?
Drax: Probably ‘cause Rocket stole some of their batteries.
Rocket: Dude!
Drax: [awkwardly] Right… he didn’t steal some of those. I don’t know why they’re after us, what a mystery this is.
Quill: What were you thinking?
Rocket: Dude, they were really easy to steal!
Gamora: That’s your defense?
Rocket: Come on! You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us. Now I’m teaching her a lesson!
Quill: I didn’t realize your motivation was altruism. It’s really a shame the Sovereign’s mistaking your intentions and they’re trying to kill us.
Rocket: Exactly.
Quill: I was being sarcastic!
Rocket: Oh, no! You’re supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!
Gamora: Can your bickering on a hold until after we survive this massive space battle?
Quill: More incoming!
Rocket: Good, I want to kill some guys!
Sovereign Woman: Damn it!
Ayesha: What is the delay, Admiral?
Sovereign Admiral: High Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible… and could destroy the entire fleet.
Ayesha: Our concern is their slight against our people. We hired them and they steal from us. It is heresy of the highest order.
Sovereign Admiral: All command modules… fire with the intent to kill.
Quill: What’s the nearest habitable planet?
Gamora: It’s called Berhert.
Quill: How many jumps?
Gamora: Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.
Drax: Quill, to make it through that you’d have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.
Quill: Lucky for us, I…
Rocket: I am. What are you doing?
Quill: I’ve been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.
Rocket: I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.
Quill: You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!
Gamora: Stop it.
Rocket: Later on tonight, you’re gonna be laying down, there’s gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase. And you’re gonna be like, ""what’s this?"", and it’s gonna be because I put a turd in there.
Quill: You put your turd in my bed and I shave you!
Rocket: Oh, it won’t be my turd. It’ll be Drax’s.
Drax: [laughs] I have famously huge turds!
Gamora: We’re about to die, and this is what we’re discussing?
Rocket: Son of a…
Quill: Dude! Seriously!
Rocket: Hey! Let me…
Nebula: Idiots!
Rocket: [smiles] Well, that’s what you get when Quill flies.
[Gamora throws something at Rocket]
Gamora: We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.
Quill: Our weapons are down.
Gamora: 20 clicks to the jump! Hold on.
[Nebula tries to steal another fruit, but Drax kicks it out of her grasp.]
Drax: It’s not ripe.
[In Sovereign control, Zylak is one of the few ones controlling a droid.]
Zylak's Frenemy Come on, Zylak. You can do this.
All Sovereign: Yes!
[In the Milano cockpit]
Gamora: 15 clicks to the jump!
All Sovereign: Come on! Keep going!
Gamora: 10 clicks!
Drax: Die, spaceship!
[Drax hits the ship with his shot and destroys Zylak's ship]
Sovereign: You suck, Zylak.
Sovereign Woman: Typical.
Gamora: Five clicks!
Quill: Son of a… They went around the field!
Sovereign General: Someone destroyed all our ships!
Ayesha: What? Who?
Gamora: One click!
Rocket: What is that?
Quill: Who cares? That’s the jump point! Go!
Rocket: It’s a guy.
Gamora: [noticing Drax is still out there] Oh, my God. He’s still out there?
Quill: Groot, put your seatbelt on! Prepare for a really bad landing!
Drax: [laughing] That was awesome! Yes!
[All the Guardians are out of their ship and notice the Milano is destroyed.]
Gamora: Look at this! Where is the other half of our ship?
Quill: My ship.
Gamora: Either one of you could have gotten us through that field… had you flown with what’s between your ears instead of what’s between your legs!
Quill: If what’s between my legs had a hand on it… I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.
Gamora: [in a scolding tone] Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.
Quill: More like because he stole… the Anulax batteries!
Drax: They’re called Harbulary batteries.
Quill: No, they’re not!
Rocket: Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?
Quill: I'm not gonna answer to ""Star-Munch.""
Rocket: I did it because I wanted to!
Quill: Dick.
Rocket: What are we even talking about this for? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships!
Drax: How little?
Rocket: [holding his thumb and forefinger close together] Well, I don't know, like this?
Gamora: [skeptically] A little one-inch man saved us?
Rocket: Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.
Quill: It's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.
Rocket: Don't call me a racoon!
Quill: I'm sorry. I took it too far. I meant trash panda.
[Rocket looks around in confusion]
Rocket: Is that better?
Drax: I don't know.
Quill: [snickering] It's worse. It's so much worse.
Rocket: You son of a…
Quill: Hey!
Rocket: I’ve had it with you!
Quill: No! Back up!
Nebula: [notices a ship coming through] Someone followed you through the jump point. Set me free, you’ll need my help.
Gamora: I’m not a fool, Nebula.
Nebula: You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.
Gamora: You’ll attack me the moment I let you go.
Nebula: [terrible at lying] No, I won’t.
Quill: You’d think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.
Drax: I bet it’s the one-inch man.
Ego: After all these years, I’ve found you.
Peter Quill: And who the hell are you?
Ego: I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious. My name is Ego… and I’m your dad, Peter.
Howard the Duck: You know what they say… ""You’re out of luck until you’ve gone duck.""
Tullk: Yondu! Come on down!
Stakar Ogord: After going around years in circles… with this woman I end up marrying. I said, ""Aleta, I love you, girl… ""but you’re losing your mind!"" Then again, she’s always been that way. I could never trust her. You know?
Yondu Udonta: Stakar. It’s been some time.
Stakar: It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.
Yondu: Stakar!
Stakar: There’s a hundred Ravager factions. You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.
Inn Keeper's Wife: Please, sir. Please!
Stakar: Get away from me.
Yondu: You can go to hell then. I don't give a damn what you think of me.
Stakar: So what are you following us for?""
Yondu: Are you gonna listen to what I gotta say?!
Stakar: I don't gotta listen to nothing, you betrayed the code. Ravagers don't deal in kids!
Yondu: I told you before, I didn't know what was going on...
Stakar: You didn't know cause you didn't wanna know cause that made you rich.
Yondu: I demand a seat on the table. I wear these flames, same as you!
Stakar: You may dress like us, but you'll never hear the hordes of freedom when you die Yondu, and the colors of Ogord will never flash over your grave. If you think I take pleasure in exiling you, you're wrong. You broke all our hearts.
Taserface: Ah, pathetic. First, Quill betrays us… and Yondu just lets him go scot-free. We followed him because he was the one… who wasn’t afraid to do what needed to be done. Seems he’s goin’ soft.
Kraglin Obfonteri: If he’s so soft, why are you whispering?
Taserface: You know I’m right, Kraglin.
Tullk: You best be very careful what you say about our captain.
'Ravager: [sees Ayesha] Who the hell is that?
Ayesha: Yondu Udonta… I have a proposition for you.
Ego: I hired Yondu to pick you up when your mother passed away. But instead of returning you, Yondu kept you. I have no clue as to why.
Quill: Well, I’ll tell you why. Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn’t. It made it easier for thievin’.
Ego: Well, I’ve been trying to track you down ever since.
Drax: I thought Yondu was your father.
Quill: What? We’ve been together this whole time… and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?
Drax: You look exactly alike.
Rocket Raccoon: One’s blue!
Peter Quill: No, he’s not my father! Yondu was the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight, and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.
Ego: Eat you?
Peter Quill: Yeah.
Ego: Oh, that son of a bitch.
Gamora: How’d you locate us now?
Ego: Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of what’s known… we’ve heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord. What say we head out there right now? Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there. I promise you… it’s unlike any other place you’ve ever seen. And there… I can explain your very special heritage. Finally get to be… the father I’ve always wanted to be. Excuse me. I’ve gotta take a whiz. [goes to the bathroom; Peter looks at Gamora, still not believing his father]
Quill: I’m not buying it.
Gamora: Let’s go take a walk.
Mantis: [smiles; to Drax] I am Mantis.
Drax: What are you doing?
Mantis: Smiling. I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.
Drax: Not if you do it like that.
Mantis: Oh… I was raised alone on Ego’s planet. I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction. Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.
Drax: Yes. That is called a practical joke!
Mantis: I liked it very much!
Drax: I just made it up!
Quill: Give me a break! After all this time, you’re gonna show up, and all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?
Gamora: I hear you.
Quill: And by the way, this could be a trap. The Kree purists, the Ravagers… they all want us dead.
Gamora:I know, but…
Quill: But what?
Gamora: What was that story you once told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Quill: Who?
Gamora: He owned a magic boat?
Quill: [long pause] David Hasselhoff?
Gamora: Right.
Quill: Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Gamora: Why did he talk again?
Quill: To help him fight crime, and to be supportive!
Gamora: As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket… and you would tell all the other children… that he was your father, but that he was out of town.
Quill: Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?
Gamora: I love that story.
Quill: I hate that story. It’s so sad! As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad. And I wanted that, more than anything in the world!
Gamora: That’s my point, Peter. What if this man is your Hasselhoff? If he ends up being evil… we will just kill him.
Nebula: You’re leaving me with that fox?
Gamora: He’s not a fox. Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it.
Rocket: Okay.
Gamora: [to Groot] It’ll be just a couple of days. We’ll be back before Rocket’s finished fixing the ship. [Groot gives her a sad smile and wave.]
Drax: What if the Sovereign come?
Quill: There’s no way for them to know we’re here. Let’s go.
Drax: I’m uncertain about parting ways.
Quill: God, you’re like an old woman.
Drax: Because I’m wise?
Gamora: Why do you have so much luggage?
Drax: I don’t want Groot playing with my things.
Rocket: I hope Daddy isn’t as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.
Quill: What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you? Because it’s working.
[Quill, Gamora and Drax enter Ego's ship, which immediately takes off.]
Quill: Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
Mantis: [shocked] Oh… No one has ever asked me a personal question.
Quill: Your antennas. What are they for?
Mantis: Their purpose?
Drax: Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Quill: Dude. You're not supposed to say that…
Drax: I say: if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low, your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.
Quill: Right, and if it's anything other than specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.
Mantis: They are not for feeling doorways! [Drax groans, Peter laughs] I think they have something to do with my empathic abilities.
Gamora: What are those?
Mantis: If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.
Quill: You read minds?
Mantis: No. Telepaths know thoughts. Empaths feel feelings, emotions. May I?
Quill: Alright.
Mantis: [touches Quill's hand; as she feels his feelings, her antennas lit up] You feel… love!
Quill: Yeah, I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody around me.
Mantis: No. Romantic, sexual love…
Quill: No… no, I don't…
Mantis: For her! [points at Gamora]
Quill: No! [Gamora looks surprised] That is not… [Drax suddenly starts laughing uproariously] Okay. [Drax continues laughing and points at Peter as he groans] That's…
Drax: She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!
Quill: Dude, come on! I think you're overreacting a little bit.
Drax: You must be so embarrassed!
[Drax continues cackling as Gamora is in amusement]
Drax: [to Mantis] Do me! Do me, do me!
[She reaches over and touches his chest, and immediately starts laughing along with him]
Mantis: I have never felt such humor!
[Drax and Mantis are laughing and pointing at Peter]
Quill: [to himself] So unbelievably uncool.
Drax: [stops laughing] Oh, Quill…
[Mantis, who is giggling, walks over to Gamora to touch her]
Gamora: [suddenly grabs her wrist] Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw. [pause as Mantis looks scared and looks at Gamora, before she finally lets go of Mantis' wrist]
Mantis: I can… also alter emotions to some extent.
Peter Quill: Yeah, like what?
Mantis: If I touch someone who is sad, I can ease them into contentment for a short while. I can make a stubborn person compliant. But I mostly use it to help my master sleep. He lies awake at night, thinking about his progeny.
Drax: …Do one of those on me! [Mantis puts her hand on Drax's head]
Mantis: Sleep. [Suddenly, Drax immediately falls asleep and snores loudly]
[Scene changes to Rocket on Berhert]
Rocket: I love this song.
Ravager: Ain’t so tough now without all your toys… are you?
Rocket: Crap.
Yondu: Hey there, rat!
Rocket: How's it goin', you blue idiot?
Yondu: Not so bad! We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here! This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her, because she wants to kill y'all.
[All the Ravagers laugh; back to the destroyed Milano]
Nebula: [to Baby Groot] Your friend… There's too many of them. He needs my help. If you care about him… You need to get me out of these bonds. They are going to kill him!
Yondu: [to Rocket] I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you. I put a tracer on your ship back there… during the war over Xandar.
Rocket: Give me your word you won't hurt Groot, and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
Yondu: [chuckles a little] Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat. Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Taserface: Otherwise, you'd what?
Yondu We'll take them batteries! They’re worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?
Taserface: That Priestess offered us a million! A quarter is only… one-third of that!
Yondu: A quarter ain't a third…
Gef: A quarter is 25. [Yondu shakes his head]
Yondu: No.
Gef: We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.
Yondu: Enough! The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy! The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.
Kraglin: [off-screen] That ain't right! I just gotta say it this one time, Cap'n… No matter how many times Quill betrays you, you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
Ravagers: Yeah!!
Kraglin: I'm the one what sticks up for you!
Tullk: Take it easy, Kraglin.
Taserface: Damn straight, lad! He's gone soft. Suppose it’s time for a change in leadership!
[All the Ravagers start agreeing as they cock their guns at each other and Yondu prepares to whistle his Yaka arrow; the Ravagers continue to yell and holding their weapons at each other]
Tullk: Put your damn guns down!!
Rocket: Whoa! Whoa. There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas… or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.
[Suddenly, a blast destroys Yondu's control fin, knocking him unconscious, and we see Nebula behind them.]
Nebula: Well, hello boys. [takes a bite of the root she's holding; spits it out] It’s not ripe.
[George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord"" plays, as the three Guardians, Ego and Mantis leave the ship, and we see the psychedelic landscape of Ego's planet.]
Ego: Welcome, everyone, to my world.
Quill: Wow. You have your own planet?
Ego: Come on. No larger than your Earth’s Moon.
Drax: Humility. I like it. I, too, am extraordinarily humble.
Gamora: You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you exactly?
Ego: I’m what’s called a Celestial, sweetheart.
Quill: A Celestial, like a god?
Ego: Mmm, small ""g,"" son. At least on the days I’m feeling humble as Drax. I don’t know where I came from exactly. First thing I remember is flickering… adrift in the cosmos utterly… and entirely alone. Over millions of years… I learned to control the molecules around me. I grew smarter and stronger. And I continued building from there… layer by layer… the very planet you walk on now. But I wanted more. I desired… meaning. ""There must be some life out there in the universe… besides just me,"" I thought. And so, I set myself the task of finding it. I created… what I imagined biological life to be like… down to the most minute detail.
Drax: Did you make a penis?
Quill: Dude!
Gamora: What is wrong with you?
Drax: If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her!
Quill: I don’t need to hear how my parents…
Drax: Why? My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.
Quill: That’s disgusting.
Drax: It was beautiful. You Earthers have hang-ups.
Ego: Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Drax: Ha! Thank you!
Ego: It’s not half bad.
Drax: Oh.
Quill: - Ugh.
Ego: I’ve also got pain receptors, and a digestive system… and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human… as I set out amongst the stars… until I found… what I sought. Life. I was not alone in the universe after all.
Quill: When did you meet my mother?
Ego: Not long after. It was with Meredith that I first experienced love. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter… you. I have searched for you for so long. And when I heard of a man from Earth… who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying… I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.
Peter Quill: If you loved her, why did you leave her?
[Scene changes to the Ravagers' ship.]
Tullk: This is mutiny! This is mutiny!
Oblo: Captain! Help me! Please! Captain!
Taserface: You're the one what killed those men… by leading them down the wrong path. Because you're weak. And stupid! It's time for the Ravagers… to rise once again to glory with a new captain… Taserface!
Rocket: I'm sorry. Your name is… It's Taserface?
Taserface: That's right.
Rocket: Do you shoot tasers out of your face?
Taserface: It's metaphorical!
Rocket: For what?
Taserface: For it is a name what strikes fear… into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
Rocket: Okay… whatever you say.
Taserface: You shut up. You're next. Udonta, I have waited a long time to do… What?
Rocket: I'm sorry. I am so sorry! I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir… looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself… ""You know what would be a really kick-ass name? ""Taserface!"" That’s how I hear you in my head! What was your second choice?Scrotum Hat?
Taserface: New plan. We're killing you first.
Rocket: Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life… as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.
Nebula: That’s enough killing for today.
Ravager: She's the daughter of Thanos.
Taserface: I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
Nebula: That was when Daddy was paying my bills. The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself. And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces. I assure you… I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick… or a talking woodland beast. I want 10% of the take… and a couple more things.
Kraglin: We got a whole box of hands… if that one don’t work out.
Nebula: It is fine.
Kraglin: You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?
Nebula: The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.
Kraglin: Well, here it is. It’s the best ship we got. Location of Ego’s planet in the nav. We’ll wire you the 10% once we’s paid. What are you gonna do with your share?
Nebula:  As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training. Every time my sister prevailed… my father would replace a piece of me with machinery… claiming he wanted me to be her equal. But she won… again and again, and again, never once refraining. So after I murder my sister… I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death. I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly… piece by piece… until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain… I know every single day.
Kraglin: Yeah. I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something to make the other girls go, ""Ooh, that’s nice!"" Anyways, happy trails.
[Scene changes to Ego's planet]
Quill: My mother told everyone my father was from the stars. She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.
Ego: Peter…
Quill: Listen, I’d love to believe all of this, I really would. But you left… the most wonderful woman ever… to die alone.
Ego: I didn’t want to leave your mother, Peter. If I don’t return regularly to my planet… and the light within it… this form will wither and perish.
Quill: So why didn’t you come back? Why did you send Yondu? A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?
Ego: I loved your mother, Peter! I couldn’t stand to set foot on an Earth… where she wasn’t living! You can’t imagine what that’s like!
Quill: I know exactly what that feels like! I had to watch her die!
Ego: Over the millions and millions of years of my existence… I’ve made many mistakes, Peter. But you’re not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be. There’s so much that I need to teach you about this planet… and the light within. They are a part of you, Peter.
Quill: What do you mean?
Ego: Give me your hands, son. Here. Hold them like that. Now, close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of this planet. Yes!
Quill: Whoa!
Ego: Yes! It’s okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back. Yes! Yes, now shape it. Feel that energy. Yes. You’re home. Peter…
Drax: How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?
Mantis: Ego found me in my larva state. Orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.
Drax: So you’re a pet?
Mantis: I suppose.
Drax: People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want such a hideous one?
Mantis: I am hideous?
Drax: You are horrifying to look at. Yes. But that’s a good thing.
Mantis: Oh?
Drax: When you’re ugly, and someone loves you… you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust.
Mantis: Well, then I’m certainly grateful to be ugly.
Drax: Those pools, they remind me of a time… when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld. She was like you.
Mantis: Disgusting?
Drax: Innocent.
Mantis: Drax? There’s something I must tell you. [Before she can tell him, Gamora walks through the doors with a suspicious look on her face.]
Gamora: What’s going on?
Drax: This gross bug lady is my new friend.
Mantis: I’m learning many things, like I’m a pet and ugly.
Gamora: You’re not ugly. Drax!
Drax: What are you talking about?
Gamora: [to Mantis] Mantis… can you show us where we’ll be staying? Why are there no other beings on this planet?
Mantis: The planet is Ego. A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.
Gamora: And you’re not a flea?
Mantis: I’m a flea with a purpose. I help him sleep.
Gamora: What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?
Mantis: Nothing. Your quarters are this way.
Taserface: We deliver you to the Kree in the morning. Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
Rocket: Okay, Taserface. Hey, tell the other guys we said… ""Hi,"" Taserface!
(SIGHS)
Gef: What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?
Taserface: No, Gef. It’s too adorable to kill. Take it to the tailor.
Rocket: No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.
Yondu: I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me. He offered me a place with the Ravagers. He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code. But I was young… and greedy, and stupid. Like you stealing those batteries.
Rocket: That was mostly Drax.
Yondu: Me and Stakar and the other captains… we weren’t so different from you and your friends. The only family I ever had. When I broke the code… they exiled me. This is what I deserve.
Rocket: Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I don’t. We gotta get outta here.
Yondu: Where’s Quill?
Rocket: He went off with his old man.
Yondu: Ego?
Rocket: Yeah. It’s a day for dumbass names. (CHUCKLES) You’re smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling. But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.
Yondu: You like a professional asshole or what?
Rocket: Pretty much a pro. Why didn’t you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?
Yondu: He was skinny. Could fit into places we couldn’t. Good for thievin’.
Rocket: Uh-huh.
Yondu: I got an idea on how to get outta here. But we’re gonna need your little friend.
ALL: (CHANTING) Mascot, mascot, mascot…

Yondu: Psst! Hey, twig! Come here. Come on.
Rocket: Aw, man… what did they do to you?
Yondu: Hey, you wanna help us get outta here? There’s something I need you to get, and bring back to me. In the captain’s quarters, there’s a prototype fin… the thing I wore on my head. There’s a drawer next to the bunk. It’s in that. It’s red. You got it?
(RAVAGERS SNORING)
(GROOT COMES BACK WITH UNDERWEAR)
Yondu: That’s my underwears.
Rocket: Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn’t know what you were talkin’ about. You have to explain it more careful.
Yondu: It’s a prototype fin.
(SCREECHING)
Rocket: That’s an orloni. It’s a fin, Groot.
Yondu: You explain it this time.
Rocket: All right.
Yondu: That’s Vorker’s eye. He takes it out when he sleeps. Go. Look again.
Rocket: But leave the eye here.
Yondu: Why?
Rocket: He’s gonna wake up tomorrow… and he’s not gonna know… where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
Yondu:That’s a desk.
Rocket: We told you it was this big.
(GROOT RETURNS WITH A TOE)
Rocket: Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere… with a bunch of severed human toes. (YONDU SHAKES HIS HEAD NO) Okay. Then let’s just agree to never discuss this.
Yondu: The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it. Okay?
(GROOT HOLDS COIN OVER HEAD)
Yondu: What? No!
Rocket: He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.
Yondu: That’s not what I said!
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: He’s relieved you don’t want him to.
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: He hates hats.
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: On anyone, not just himself.
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head… the next minute it’s just because you realize part of that head is the hat. That’s why you don’t like hats?
Yondu: This is an important conversation right now?
(SNORING)
(BURPS)
Kraglin: That ain’t it. I didn’t mean to do a mutiny. They killed all my friends.
Yondu: Get the third quadrant ready for release.
Rocket: One more thing. You got any clones of Quill’s old music on the ship?

Gamora: What unspoken thing?
Quill: This… Cheers, Sam and Diane… a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other… but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down… sort of thing.
Gamora: There’s no unspoken thing.
Quill: Well, it’s a catch-22, because if you said it, then it would be spoken… and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it… you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.
Gamora: No, that’s not what I…
(SIGHS)
Gamora: What we should be discussing right now is something about this place. It doesn’t feel right.

Quill: Why are you trying to take this away from me?
Gamora: I’m not trying…
Quil: He’s my father. He’s blood.
Gamora: You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.
Quill: Again, you made me come here! And Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.
Gamora: No, it’s because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.
Quill: This is real! I’m only half-human, remember?
Gamora: That’s the half I’m worried about.
Quill: Oh, I get it. You’re jealous… because I’m part-god, and you like when I’m the weak one.
Gamora: You were insufferable to begin with. I haven’t been able to reach Rocket. I’m gonna go outside, and I’m gonna try and get a signal.
Quill: You know what? This is not Cheers after all! This is whatever the show is where one person is willing… to open themselves up to new possibility, and the other person is a jerk… who doesn’t trust anybody!
Gamora: It’s a show that doesn’t exist.

Quill: Brandy? By Looking Glass?
Ego: (CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom’s.
Quill: Yeah, it was.
Ego: One of Earth’s greatest musical compositions. Perhaps its very greatest.
Quill: Yes!
Ego: Peter, you and I, we’re the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer’s day. Bringing gifts from far away.

Brandy, you’re a fine girl.

Ego: Yes! As long as the light exists. And I can use the light to build cool things… like how you made this whole planet? It might take you a few million years of practice… before you get really good at it. But, yes!

But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it… it was all so… disappointing. And that is when I came… to a profound realization.

 Yondu: I know you steal batteries you don't need, and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you, 'cause just a little bit of love reminds you of how big and empty that hole inside you actually is!
 Rocket: I said shut up!
 Yondu: I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's a[seal bark] about you!
 Rocket: I'm serious, dude!
 Yondu: Just like my own damn parents who sold me, their own little baby, into slavery! I know who you are, boy…because you're me. [they both look at each other]
 Rocket Raccoon: …what kind of a pair are we?
 Yondu Udonta: The kind that’s about to go fight a planet, I reckon.
 Rocket Raccoon: All right, okay! Good... [pauses for what he just heard] Wait. Fight a what?
 [Back in Drax's room, Gamora attacks Mantis and grabs her by the throat while pinning her high up against the wall]
 Gamora: Who are you people? What is this place?
 Drax the Destroyer: Gamora, let her go!
 Gamora: The bodies in the caverns… Who are they?
 Mantis: You are scared. [touches Gamora, who immediately releases her after Mantis uses her empathy]
 Ego: I call it the Expansion. It is my purpose… and now it is yours as well.
 Peter Quill: It’s beautiful.
 Ego: Over thousands of years… I implanted thousands of extensions of myself… on thousands of worlds. I need to fulfill life’s one true purpose… To grow and spread… covering all that exists… until everything is… Me!
 Gamora: [reacting with Mantis' powers] What did she do to me?
 Drax the Destroyer: She already told me everything.
 Ego: I only had one problem. A single Celestial doesn’t have enough power for such an enterprise. But two Celestials… Well, now, that just might do.
 Mantis: [to the Guardians]The bodies… are his children.
 Ego: Out of all my labors… the most beguiling was… attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species. I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough… to power the Expansion. I had Yondu deliver some of them to me. It broke the Ravager code, but I compensated him generously… and to ease his conscience, I said I’d never hurt them. I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing. But one after the other, they failed me. Not one of them carried the Celestial genes. Until you, Peter. Out of all my spawn… only you carried the connection to the light.
 Gamora: We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.
 Mantis: Ego will have won him to his side by now.
 Nebula: Then we just go.
 Gamora: No! He’s our friend.
 Nebula: [to Gamora] All any of you do is yell at each other. You're not friends.
 Drax: You're right… we're family. We leave no one behind. [to Nebula] Except maybe you. [Nebula mocks at the Guardians]
 Nebula: Oh, my God.
 Ego the Living Planet: For the first time in my existence… I am truly not alone! [notices Peter's sad expression] What is it, son?
 Peter Quill: My friends.
 Ego the Living Planet: You see, that’s the mortal in you, Peter.

 Quill: Yes.
 Ego: We are beyond such things.
 Quill: Yes.
 Ego: Now…
 Quill: But my mother… You said you loved my mother.
 Ego: And that I did. My river lily who knew all the words to every song that came over the radio. I returned to Earth to see her three times. And I knew if I returned a fourth… I’d never leave. The Expansion… the reason for my very existence, would be over. So, I did what I had to do. But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

 Peter Quill: [hearing this, he breaks off Ego's power] What?
 Ego the Living Planet: Now, all right… I know that sounds bad. [in rage, Peter fires multiple Element Gun shots at Ego] Who in the hell do you think you are?
 Peter Quill: [furious] You killed my mother!!!
 Ego the Living Planet: I tried… so hard… to find the form… that best suited you… and this is the thanks I get? You really need to grow up. - I wanted to do this together… but I suppose you’ll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery!
 Gamora: Finally! Rocket?
 Rocket Raccoon: Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you. We’re in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used… to slice open the Bank of A ‘askavaria.
 Gamora: Ego’s unhinged.
 Rocket Raccoon: I know. Get ready.
 Yondu Udonta: Drop her, Kraglin. Now.
 Ego: My life, my love. My lady is the sea Peter… this is the sea.
 Yondu Udonta: [sees Ego putting a tentacle through Peter's body] Hey, there, jackass!
 Man: What is that thing?
 Drax the Destroyer: Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!
 Gamora: [helps Peter up] I told you something didn’t feel right.
 Peter Quill: ""I told you so."" Just what I need to hear right now.
 Gamora: Well, I came back, didn’t I?
 Peter Quill: Because there’s an unspoken thing.
 Gamora: There is no unspoken thing. [helps Peter up]
 Drax the Destroyer: What are you doing? You could’ve killed us all!
 Rocket Raccoon: Uh… ""Thank you, Rocket""?
 Drax the Destroyer: We had it under control.
 Mantis: We did not. That is only an extension… of his true self. He will be back soon.
 Peter Quill: [sees Nebula] What’s Smurfette doing here?
 Nebula: Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.
 Rocket Raccoon: She tried to murder me!
 Nebula: I saved you, you stupid fox!
 Gamora: [annoyed] He’s not a fox.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket Raccoon: I’m not a raboon, either.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket Raccoon: ""Raccoon."" Whatever.
 Drax the Destroyer: How do we kill a Celestial?
 Peter Quill: There’s a center to him. His brain, his soul, whatever it is… Some sort of protective shell.
 Mantis: It’s in the caverns… below the surface.
 Peter Quill: [comes up and sees Yondu sitting in the driver's seat] Yondu?
 Yondu Udonta: Thrusters are out.
 Peter Quill: Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise, you’d have delivered me to this maniac.
 Yondu Udonta: You still reckon that’s the reason I kept you around, you idiot?
 Peter Quill: That’s what you told me, you old doofus.
 Yondu Udonta: Once I figured out what happened to them other kids… I wasn’t just gonna hand you over.
 Peter Quill: You said you were gonna eat me.
 Yondu Udonta: That was being funny!
 Peter Quill: Not to me!
 Rocket Raccoon: [to adoptive father and son] You people have issues.
 Peter Quill: Of course I have issues. [Ego's avatar begins to reform, looking quite horrifying.] That’s my freakin’ father! Thrusters are back up.
 Yondu Udonta: We should be going up!
Peter Quill: We can’t! Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him. Rocket!
 Rocket Raccoon: Got it!
Peter Quill: Whoo-hoo!
 Rocket Raccoon: So, we’re saving the galaxy again?
Peter Quill: I guess.
 Rocket Raccoon: Awesome! We’re really gonna be able to jack up our prices if we’re two-time galaxy savers.
Peter Quill: I seriously can’t believe that’s where your mind goes.
 Rocket Raccoon: It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends. Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings… and all the animals on the planets.
Peter Quill: And the people.
 Rocket Raccoon: Meh.
 Mantis: The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!
 [Kraglin listens to more of Peter's music but stops when he sees the sovereign fleet appear.]
 Ayesha: Pilots… release envoy units. Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet. Dive!
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Um… Captain? Captain?
 Yondu Udonta: Tell me why Ego wants you here?
 Peter Quill: He needs my genetic connection to the light… to help destroy the universe. He tried to teach me how to control the power.
 Yondu Udonta: So, could you?
 Peter Quill: A little. I made a ball.
 Yondu Udonta: A ball?
 Peter Quill: I thought as hard as I could. It was all that I could come up with.
 Yondu Udonta: You ""thought""? You think when I make this arrow fly, I use my head?
 Mantis: That’s Ego’s core.
 Peter Quill: That core is thick, Rocket.
 Rocket Raccoon: I got it covered.
 Mantis: We must hurry. It will not take Ego long to find us.
 Rocket Raccoon: Keep it steady.
 Peter Quill: We drill into the center, we kill him!
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Captain?
 Yondu Udonta: What is it, Kraglin?
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?
 Yondu Udonta: Yeah, why?
 Kraglin Obfonteri: I... Uh…
 Yondu Udonta: Oh, hell!
 Peter Quill: Why aren’t you firing the lasers?
 Rocket Raccoon: They blew out the generator. I think I packed a small detonator.
 Nebula: A detonator is worthless without explosives.
 Rocket Raccoon: Well, we got these.
 Peter Quill: Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
 Rocket Raccoon: If it is, it’ll cause a chain reaction… throughout his entire nervous system.
 Peter Quill: Meaning what?
 Rocket Raccoon: The entire planet will explode. We’ll have to get out of here fast. I rigged a timer.
 Peter Quill: Go!
 Mantis: He’s coming.
 Drax the Destroyer: Didn’t you say you could make him sleep?
 Mantis: When he wants. He’s too powerful. I can’t!
 Drax the Destroyer: You don’t have to believe in yourself… because I believe in you.
 Mantis: Sleep!
 Drax the Destroyer:  I never thought she’d be able to do it… with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.
 Mantis: I don’t know how long I can hold him.
 Rocket Raccoon: The metal’s too thick. For the bomb to work, we’d actually need to place it on Ego’s core. And our fat butts ain’t gonna fit through those tiny holes.
 Peter Quill: Well…
 Rocket Raccoon: That’s a terrible idea.
 Peter Quill: Which is the only kind of idea we have left.
 Rocket Raccoon:  Unbelievable. ""Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that.""
 Peter Quill: What a day.
Rocket Raccoon: Alright, first you flip this switch, then this one. That activates it. Then you push this button, which will give you five minutes to get outta there. Now, whatever you do, don't push this button, because that will set off the bomb immediately and we'll all be dead. Now, repeat back what I just said.
 Groot: I am Groot...
 Rocket Raccoon: Uh-huh.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket Raccoon: That's right...
 Groot: [points to death button] I am Groot!
 Rocket Raccoon: No! No, that's the button that will kill everyone! Try again.
 Groot: Hm. I am Groot...
 Rocket Raccoon: Mmhm.
 Groot: I am Groot...?
 Rocket Raccoon: Uh-huh.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket Raccoon: No! That's exactly what you just sai- how's that even possible?! Which button is the one you're supposed to push? Point to it.
 Rocket Raccoon: NOOO!
 Peter Quill: [From skylight] Hey, you're makin' him nervous!
 Rocket Raccoon: Shut up and give me some tape! Does anyone have any tape out there?! I wanna put some tape over the death button.
 Peter Quill: I don't have any tape! Lemme check! [jetpacks away to Yondu; in the background] Yo, Yondu! Do you have a-- [explosion] Do you have any tape? [pause as more explosions are heard in the background] Gamora! Do you have any tape? ...TAPE! Ah, never mind! Drax! Do you have any tape?! Yeah! Scotch tape would work! Then why would you ask me if scotch tape would work, if you don't have any?! [reappears] Nobody has any tape!
 Rocket Raccoon: Not a single person has tape?!
 Peter Quill: Nope!
 Rocket Raccoon: Did you ask Nebula?
 Peter Quill: [thinks] Yes!
 Rocket Raccoon: Are you sure?
 Peter Quill: I asked Yondu, and she was standing right next to him!
 Rocket Raccoon: I knew you were lying!
 Peter Quill: [Groot grabs the bomb and runs back] You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag! IF ANYBODY'S GONNA HAVE TAPE, IT'S YOU!!
 Rocket Raccoon: That's exactly my point! I have to do EVERYTHING!!
 Peter Quill: You are wasting a lot of time here!
 Groot: Whee!
 Rocket Raccoon: We’re all gonna die.
 Yondu Udonta: Rear thrusters are out again! We’re done for without that generator!
 Ayesha: Guardians… perhaps it will provide you solace… that your deaths are not without purpose. They will serve as a warning… to all of those tempted with betraying us. Don’t screw with the Sovereign. This is gonna hurt.
 Nebula: Promises, promises.
 Peter Quill: We’re gonna blow!

Gamora: Peter! No!
 Peter Quill: [to Yondu, floating in the air, hanging on his arrow] Haha!
 Yondu Udonta: What?
 Peter Quill: You look like Mary Poppins.
 Yondu Udonta: Is he cool?
 Peter Quill: [grinning] Hell yeah, he's cool.
 Yondu Udonta: I'M MARY POPPINS, Y'ALL! [""I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!"" echoes through Ego]
 Drax the Destroyer: Mantis, look out! She’s just unconscious.
 Peter Quill: [to Rocket] How long until the bomb goes off?
 Rocket Raccoon: In the unlikely event that Groot doesn’t kill us all… about six minutes.
 Yondu Udonta: Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction. T-minus five minutes.
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Aye, Captain.
 Peter Quill: Somebody’s gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis.
 Drax the Destroyer: Ow! My nipples!
 [Gamora and Nebula fall down through the crumbling planet. Only Rocket, Peter and Yondu remain]
 Peter Quill: Gamora!
 Ego:  Peter!
 Nebula: Get over it.
 Ego: Come now, Peter. I know this isn’t what you want. What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice? Soon, Peter, we will be all there is. So stop pissing me off!
 Gamora: We have to get up to the extraction point! [She and Nebula look at each other] Go!
 Ego: I told you… I don’t want to do this alone. You cannot deny… the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
 Officer on Earth: Everyone, I need you to stay back!
 Male Photographer: What is that?
 Ego: It doesn’t need to be like this, Peter. Why are you destroying our chance? Stop pretending you aren’t what you are. One in billions. Trillions. Even more. What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?
 Yondu Udonta: I don’t use my head to fly the arrow, boy! I use my heart…
 Peter Quill: You shouldn’t have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.
 Rocket Raccoon: Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up! I’m not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted! Groot, hurry! Yondu, we’re about to blow!
 Yondu Udonta: Get to the ship!
 Rocket Raccoon: Not without Quill!
 Yondu Udonta: You need to take care of the twig!
 Rocket Raccoon: Not without you!
 Yondu Udonta: I ain’t done nothin’ right my whole damn life, rat. You need to give me this.
 Rocket Raccoon: Uh… A spacesuit and an aero-rig. I only have one of each.
 Groot:  I am Groot.
 Yondu Udonta: What’s that?
 Rocket Raccoon: He says, ""Welcome to the frickin’ Guardians of the Galaxy."" Only he didn’t use ""frickin’.""
 Yondu Udonta: Bye, twig.
 Rocket Raccoon: [as they fly away] We’re gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.
 Gamora tends to Mantis, who is still unconscious, as Nebula sits nearby. Rocket returns with Groot.
 Gamora: (concerned) Where’s Peter? Rocket, where is he? Rocket. ROCKET LOOK AT ME! WHERE IS HE
 Rocket: (Looks down, unsure) Mmm… (Groot points in the direction of where they came from. Gamora goes in fear mode and grabs onto her blaster.
 Gamora: No. I’m not leaving without him.
 (Rocket stuns her with his blaster)
 Rocket Raccoon: (with tears) I’m sorry. I can only afford to lose one friend today. Kraglin, go!
 Drax the Destroyer: (concerned) Wait… Is Quill back? Rocket, where’s Quill? Rocket! Where’s Quill? Where’s Quill?
 Ego: No, we need to stop it. Stop. Stop. Listen to me! You are a god. If you kill me… you’ll be just like everybody else.
 Peter Quill: What’s so wrong with that?
 Ego: No!
 Yondu Udonta: He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn’t your daddy. I’m sorry I didn’t do none of it right. I’m damn lucky you’re my boy.
 Peter Quill: What? Yondu, what are you doing? You can’t. Yondu! No! No! Oh! Aww… No! No! Oh, no!
[at Yondu's funeral, the Guardians and Kraglin are surrounding Yondu's body while Nebula stands in the background.]
 Peter Quill: I told Gamora how when I was a kid I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad. He’s a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy. Earlier, it struck me… Yondu didn’t have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow. He didn’t have the beautiful voice of an angel… but he did have the whistle of one. Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures… and hooked up with hot women… and fought robots. I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all. Only it was you, Yondu. I had a pretty cool dad. What I’m trying to say here is… sometimes that thing you’re searching for your whole life… it’s right there by your side all along. You don’t even know it.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket Raccoon: He did call you twig.
 Gamora: Nebula… I was a child like you. I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day. And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you. I’m trying to make it right. There are little girls like you… across the universe who are in danger. You can stay with us and help them.
 Nebula: I will help them by killing Thanos.
 Gamora I don’t know if that’s possible. (hugs Nebula) You will always be my sister.
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Pete! Captain found this for you in a junker shop. Said you’d come back to the fold someday.
 Peter Quill: What is it?
 Kraglin Obfonteri: It’s called a Zune. It’s what everybody’s listening to on Earth nowadays. It’s got 300 songs on it.
 Peter Quill: 300 songs? Wait. [shows Kraglin the fixed arrow] Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it.
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Thanks… Captain.
 (Cat Stevens’ ""Father and Son"" plays as Peter listens to the song. As Peter listens to it, he gives Groot one of his earbuds. Just as the song plays, Ravager ships show up and the Guardians appear on deck.)
 Rocket Raccoon: They came.
 Drax the Destroyer: What is it?
 Rocket Raccoon: I sent word to Yondu’s old Ravager buddies, and told them what he did.
 Peter Quill: It’s a Ravager funeral.
 (The other ships let out fireworks and Kraglin shouts in joy before giving the Ravager salute.)
 Kraglin Obfonteri: Yeah! Yeah!
 Martinex: He didn’t let us down after all, Captain.
 Stakar Ogord: No, he did not, son. He did not.
 Charlie-27: Fare thee well, old friend.
 Aleta Ogord: Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.
 Rocket Raccoon: He didn’t chase them away.
 Peter Quill: No.
 Rocket Raccoon: Even though he yelled at them. And was always mean. And he stole batteries he didn’t need.
 Peter Quill: (looks down at Rocket) Well, of course not. (Gamora looks up at Peter, who looks back down at her curiously) What?
 Gamora: It’s just…some unspoken thing.
 (Peter gives her a small ""I told you so"" look. Gamora wraps her arm around his waist as Peter wraps his arm around her shoulders.)
 Mantis: It’s beautiful.
 Drax the Destroyer: It is. And so are you. On the inside.
 (As the song finishes, Yondu's ashes form the shape of a flying arrow and a small whistle. The song ends, as well as the movie)
 Stakar Ogord: You know, it’s a shame… that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu to bring us all together again. But I think he’d be proud knowing that we are back as a team.
 Charlie-27: I’m in.
 Aleta Ogord: Dope.
 Mainframe: I miss you guys so much!
 Martinex: Hell, yes.
 Stakar Ogord: What say we steal some shit?
 Sovereign Chambermaid: High Priestess, the Council is waiting.
 Ayesha: They are perturbed I’ve wasted our resources. When they see what I have created here… their wrath will dissipate.
 Sovereign Chambermaid: It’s a new type of birthing pod, ma’am?
 Ayesha: That, my child… is the next step in our evolution. More powerful, more beautiful… more capable of destroying the Guardians of the Galaxy. I think I shall call him… Adam.


Peter Quill: [walks into Groot's room] Ugh, dude. Seriously? You gotta clean up your room. It’s a complete mess.
Groot: I am Groot.
Peter Quill: I am not boring. You’re boring. You know what’s boring? Sitting there, playing that mind-numbing game. What’s boring is me tripping over your vines every day! I’m not boring!
Groot: I am Groot.
Peter Quill: And now I know how Yondu felt.


Watcher Informant: Hey, fellas. Wait, where are you going? You were supposed to be my lift home. How will I get out of here? Hey! Aw, gee… I’ve got so many more stories to tell. Aw, guys. Oh, gee…"

 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
 Thor: Ragnarok


[Adrian Toomes and his coworker, Phineas Mason, are studying a child's drawing of the Avengers.]

Toomes: Things are never gonna be the same now. I mean, look at this. You got aliens. You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

Mason: Actually, it's Native American, but whatever.

Toomes: Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain't bad, is it?

[Toomes squints at the drawing and Mason nods.]

Mason: No. Yeah. Kid's got a future.

Toomes: Yeah, well... We'll see, I guess.

[Toomes looks up at the damaged Avengers Tower. Helicopters pass overhead. Scaffolding covers the tower's lower floors. A roving view sends us into a ruined building across the street.]



[A clean-up crew works around a giant deceased Chitauri alien creature with pointed teeth. Alien artifacts lie among the rubble. Walking through the site, Toomes gives a worker a thumbs up. He turns to Herman Schultz, who is one of his workers.]
Toomes: No, hey! Uh-uh! You can't saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use.
[He picks up an alien object from the ground and uses it as a tool to break down the Chitauri chariot.]
Toomes: See?
Schultz: All right.
Toomes: All right. (to Brice) Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
Brice: Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
Toomes: Yeah, yeah, yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us.
[Anne Marie Hoag, the director of the Department of Damage Control, walks into the salvage site with her crew.]
Anne Marie Hoag: Attention, please! In accordance with Executive Order 396B, all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.
Toomes: Who the hell are you?
DODC Agent: Qualified personnel.
Toomes: Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so-
Anne Marie Hoag: I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected, or you will be prosecuted.
[The workers look puzzled. A worker slips an alien artifact that looks like a power source into his pocket unnoticed.]
Toomes: Ma'am, what am I- Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
Anne Marie Hoag: I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
[Toomes is left to stare at her back as she leaves. Behind him, a Damage Control Agent speaks up.]
DODC Agent: Maybe next time, don't over extend yourself.
[Toomes looks around and grins.]
Toomes: What'd you say?
[He looks around at his crew of workers. Brice whistles.]
Toomes: Yeah, he's right. I overextended myself.
[Suddenly, he punches the agent. The agents point their guns at him.]
Worker: Don't do it.
Anne Marie Hoag: Put them down.
[The agents lower their guns.]
Anne Marie Hoag: If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.
Toomes: Your superiors. Who the hell are they?


[We see a TV screen playing the news about Tony Stark and his contract with Damage Control. Toomes watches the TV with an angry look on his face.]
News Anchor: A joint venture between Stark Industries and the federal government, the Department of Damage Control will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials.
Schultz: So now the assholes who made this mess are being paid to clean it up.
Mason: Yeah, it’s all rigged.
[Mason is tinkering with the alien power source that one of the workers stole from the salvage site earlier that day.]
News Anchor: Experts estimate there are over fifteen hundred tons of exotic material scattered throughout the tri-state area.
[The glowing alien artifact is now connected to a motor with wires. The blades on the motor start to spin and the machine floats off the table. One of the workers pulls off a tarpaulin sheet covering a large piece of Chitauri artifact, revealing a dozen of glowing Chitauri energy cores.]
Worker: Hey, chief! We still have another load from yesterday. We’re supposed to turn this in, right?
Brice: I ain’t hauling it.
Mason: It’s too bad. We could have made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.
[Toomes stares at the truck full of alien items and makes up his mind.]
Toomes: I tell you what, let’s keep it. The world’s changing.
[Mason lifts his magnifying goggles and looks at his boss.]
Toomes: It’s time we change, too.


8 YEARS LATER
[The Rolling Stones’ “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking” is playing in the warehouse. Workers are moving piles of alien tech and tinkering with machines. Mason works on an elaborate rifle gun. Another worker fires a neon blast from an exotic gun. The blast shears a large item in half. Workers load piles of high tech weapons onto a van.]
[Cash pours through a money counting machine.]
[A figure wearing a flying suit with expensive metal wings soars toward the warehouse. Doors in the ceiling open and the figure drops crates of alien tech from the suits’ claw-like feet. The helmeted figure comes through the roof and lands on the platform. He steps out of the wing suit and faces Mason.]
Toomes: There you go, Mason.
[The helmet opens, revealing Toomes. Mason grins.]
Toomes: Business is good.


a Film by Peter Parker
[Through a small, rectangular screen, we see the scenery of New York passing by at a high velocity. We seem to be on a highway.]
Peter: (in a gravelly voice) New York. Queens. It’s a rough borough, but hey, it’s home.
Happy: Who are you talking to?
[Camera quickly pans to reveal Happy Hogan driving in the front seat.]
Peter: (in a normal voice) No one. Just making a little video of the trip.
Happy: You know you can’t show it to anyone.
Peter: Yeah, I know.
Happy: Then why are you narrating in that voice?
Peter: Uh... Because it’s fun.
Happy: Fun.
[Apparently, Happy thinks this whole situation is the opposite of fun. He puts on his sunglasses and solemnly looks out the windshield.]
Peter: So, uh, why do they call you Happy?
[Happy raises the limo’s partition. We see a reflection of Peter Parker holding up his phone and filming.]


[Peter gets out of the car to find a small private plane waiting for him.]
Happy: Come on. I’m not carrying your bags. Let’s go.
Peter: Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?
Happy: There’s a bathroom on it.
[Inside the plane, we see a view of the cockpit. Two seats for the pilot and the copilot are there no one is sitting in them.]
Peter: Whoa. No pilot? That’s awesome.
[Peter sits down across from Happy, directly facing him.]
Happy: Is that where you’re gonna sit?
Peter: Yeah.
Happy: This is your first time on a private plane?
Peter: My first time on any plane.
[Happy moves away to sit in another seat.]
Peter: Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?
[Later. Peter puts a finger to his lips and makes a shushing sound.]
Peter: Shh.
[Camera reveals Happy snoring. At the sound of Peter’s chuckle, Happy jerks awake, causing the whole frame to shake.]


[Inside Berlin Brandenburg Airport, we see German signs, Happy dragging his luggage behind him, and Peter’s face in quick succession.]


[Peter is sightseeing Berlin. We see Berlin streets, the Brandenburg Gate, a street performer, foreign girls, and a pretzel vendor.]
Peter: No one has actually told me why I’m in Berlin or what I’m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy.


[Happy and Peter enter a hotel.]
Happy: (pointing at a door) This is you.
Peter: Oh, we’re neighbors?
Happy: We’re not roommates. Suit up.


[Peter's hotel room. Standing in front of a mirror, we see Peter wearing his homemade Spider-Man suit, consisting of a thin, baggy sweatshirt, goggles with shutters, and web-shooters.]
Peter: Okay, Peter, you got this. You got this.
Happy: What the hell are you wearing?
[Happy is staring at Peter with a horrified look. Peter tilts down the camera to reveal his feet.]
Peter: It’s my suit.
Happy: Where’s the case?
Peter: What case? That’s not my...
[Happy opens a door, showing Peter another area of his suite.]
Peter: What? I thought that was a closet. This is still my room?
Happy: Go. Please.
Peter: My room is way bigger than...
Happy: There.
[A case is sitting on a coffee table.]
Peter: I found the case. I found the case. I found the case.
[He plucks up a card that says “A minor upgrade -TS” from the case.]
Peter: “A minor upgrade”?
[When Peter unbuckles a lock the case unfolds itself, revealing a high tech Spider-Man suit complete with awesome holograms.]
Peter: Whoa. Oh my God.
Happy: Put it on.
Peter: What the...? This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen-
Happy: Let’s go.
Peter: But, yeah. Well, I don’t understand. Is it for me?
[Camera spins to find Happy leaving the room.]
Peter: Happy, Happy, wait.
[Peter takes off the mask of his homemade Spider-Man suit with a huge, excited grin on his face.]
Peter: This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life.
Happy: Let’s go.
[He has come to drag a hyped-up Peter out of the room.]
Peter: Okay.
Happy: Come on.


[Outside Flughafen Leipzig-Halle, We see Iron Man, War Machine, Captain America, Black Widow, and Black Panther confronting each other.]
Peter: (whispers) Okay, there’s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who’s that new guy?
Tony: Underoos!
[We see Peter, now dressed in the Spider-Man suit that Tony gave him.]
Peter: Oh, that’s me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
[Peter puts down the phone and proceeds to snatch Captain America’s shield with his web.]
[Later.]
Peter: Hey, everyone.
[He is holding his camera and flying through the air to find a safe spot. We see and hear explosions everywhere.]
Peter: Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield and I threw it at him-
[We hear a metallic noise. Ant-Man grows into a giant in the background and grabs War Machine by his ankle. Peter turns to see this.]
Peter: What the hell? He’s big now. I gotta go. Hang on.
[The phone is put down and for a moment, all we see are the sky and the clouds. Then we hear the battle commencing and see Peter being flung through the air.]
Peter: Whoa!


[Back in Peter's hotel room. Peter is facing the camera, now dressed in a grey NASA T-shirt. It is obvious that he is still high on adrenaline.]
Peter: It was the most amazing thing that’s ever happened! So Mr. Stark was like, “Hey, Underoos!” and I just sort of flipped in and I stole Cap’s shield. I was like, “Hey, what’s up, everybody?” And then...
[There’s a knock on his door.]
Peter: Hey, just a second! Coming!
[He backflips to the door, but before he can open it, Happy enters in a bathrobe.]
Peter: Hey.
Happy: We have thin walls here.


[Camera starts rolling. We are now inside Tony's car. A hand reaches for it and we tilt up to find Tony Stark in a suit and sunglasses ensemble.]
Tony: What are you doing, a little video diary?
Peter: (embarrassed) Yeah.
Tony: It’s all right. I’d probably do the same.
Happy: (from the driver’s seat) I told him not to do it. He was filming everything.
Tony: It’s okay.
Happy: I’m gonna wipe the chip.
Tony: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? We should actually... We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?
[Tony takes off his sunglasses, revealing a badly bruised face.]
Peter: Yeah, hold on.
Tony: We rolling?
Peter: An alibi? Sure.
Tony: Get in the frame.
Peter: Okay.
Tony: Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
[Peter turns to Tony with a frown on his face. Tony chuckles and pats Peter’s shoulder, whose face now wears an uncomfortable smile.]
Tony: Peter, that’s inappropriate. All right, let’s start over. You can edit it.
Peter: Mm-hmm.
[Looking at Tony, Peter chuckles.]
Tony: Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed.
[Tony is putting on a solemn face. Peter offers the camera a wide-eyed, tight-lipped smile, trying to look innocent. Suddenly, we hear a loud honk.]
Happy: Come on! It’s a freaking merge. (to Tony) I’m sorry.
Tony: This is because you’re not on Queens Boulevard. (to the camera) See, Happy is... is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, and before that, he was just a driver.
[Still driving, Happy gives Tony a sidelong glance.]
Happy: That was a private conversation. I don’t like joking about this. It was hard for me to talk to you about that.
Tony: No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
[Happy slams on the brakes, making the car screech to a stop.]
Happy: All right. Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.
[Tony laughs and films Peter, who looks a bit pale.]
Tony: Happy, can you give us a moment?
Happy: You want me to leave the car?
Tony: Why don’t you grab Peter’s case out of the trunk.
[Peter’s film finally stops rolling. He slowly lowers his phone, shocked.]
Peter: I can keep the suit?
Tony: Yes, we were just talking about it.
[Tony puts his sunglasses back on and clears his throat. Through the rear window, we see Happy struggling with Peter’s case.]
Tony: Do me a favor, though. Happy’s kind of your point guy on this. Don’t stress him out. Don’t do anything stupid. I’ve seen his cardiogram. All right?
Peter: (enthusiastically) Yes.
Tony: Don’t do anything I would do, and definitely don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. There’s a... There’s a little grey area in there, and that’s where you operate.
Peter: Wait, does that mean that I’m an Avenger?
Tony: No.
[Happy knocks on the window and holds the case up.]
Happy: This it?
Tony: Seventh floor.
Peter: I can take that. You don’t have to take it.
Happy: You’re gonna take it?
Peter: Yeah, I can take that.
Happy: Thank you.
[Happy drops the case by the car.]
Peter: So when’s, when’s our next... When’s our next “retreat,” you know? Like...
Tony: What, next mission?
Peter: Yeah, the mission. The missions.
Tony: We’ll call you.
Peter: Do you have my numbers?
Tony: No, I mean, we’ll call you. Like, someone will call you.
Peter: Oh.
Tony: All right?
Peter: From your team.
Tony: Okay.
[Tony reaches for the door. Peter mistakes the gesture as a hug and brings his arms around Tony.]
Tony: It’s not a hug. I’m just grabbing the door for you. We’re not there yet.
[Peter awkwardly climbs out of the car. Almost as an afterthought, Tony calls out:]
Tony: Bye.


[Tony and Happy drive off. Holding his bag and the Spider-Man suit case, Peter grins.]
Peter: They’re gonna call me.
[He heads to the apartment entrance. There is a definite spring in his step.]


TWO MONTHS LATER
[Peter is standing in a packed subway train. He takes out his phone and types out a text.]

Hey Happy just checking in. I'm out of school at 2:45 PM
Ready for my next mission!
It's Peter BTW.
Parker
[He scrolls through numerous unanswered messages to Happy.]


[The train drops Peter off at 36th Avenue Station, which is right next to Midtown High. He walks downstairs to street level where football fields stand surrounded by fences. Peter strolls down the sidelines and approaches the main building. We see students playing all kinds of sports on the field. He climbs a flight of stairs, then quickly avoids being hit by a convertible driven by Flash Thompson, a slick-haired teenager.]
Flash: What’s up, Penis Parker?
[Students chuckle at that. Peter suppresses a sigh and moves on.]


[A school news report is playing in the hallway, Betty Brant and Jason Ionello as the news anchors.]
Betty: Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.
Jason: Students, don’t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming?
Betty: Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.
Jason: Okay.
Betty: Yeah.
[On TV, we see Jason rolling his eyes awkwardly.]
Principal Morita: Good morning.
[A teenage boy flies a drone around the crowded hallway. Peter walks by. Principal Morita grabs the drone out of the air.]
Principal Morita: Damn it. You, in my office right now.
[The drone pilot follows the principal. Other students carry elaborate science projects. Peter stops at his locker and takes off his jacket. He enters the combination and opens the locker. We see Peter from inside the locker. Suddenly, a hand pops up behind him. It’s Ned Leeds holding a Palpatine Lego figure over Peter’s shoulder.]
Ned: (imitating Emperor Palpatine) Join me, and together... we’ll build my new Lego Death Star.
Peter: What?
[Peter glances around and hears a cheerleader say:]
Cheerleader: So lame.
Peter: No way! That’s awesome. How many pieces?
Ned: Three thousand eight hundred and three.
Peter: That’s insane.
Ned: I know. You want to build it tonight?
Peter: No, I can’t tonight. I’ve got the Stark-
Ned: Mm-hmm. Stark internship.
Peter: Yeah, exactly.
[Having picked up his textbooks, Peter starts to walk down the hallway with his best friend.]
Ned: Always got that internship.
Peter: Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it’ll lead to a real job with them.
Ned: That would be so sweet.
Peter: Right?
Ned: He’d be all, “Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here’s a gold coin.”
[Peter gives him a look.]
Ned: I don’t know how jobs work.
Peter: That’s exactly how they work.
Ned: Oh. (chuckles) I’ll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place. And, and then I’ll come by afterwards...
[His voice fades out as Peter slows to a stop. In slow motion, we see who caught his eye- a pretty dark-haired girl talking with her friends down the hall. Her name is Liz. She brushes her hair back and their eyes meet for a fleeting moment. Peter is mesmerized. He can barely keep up with his conversation with Ned.]
Ned: ...because for the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.
Peter: That’d be great.
[The school bell rings.]
Girl: I’m gonna be late!


[We are now in physics class.]
Ms. Warren: Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?
[She points at Flash, who is confidently holding up his hand.]
Ms. Warren: Flash.
Flash: It’s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by the mass.
Ms. Warren: Nope.
[Another hand goes up, but Ms. Warren calls out a student who clearly is having difficulty focusing on the lecture.]
Ms. Warren: Peter. You still with us?
[Peter has been watching a video of Spider-Man on YouTube.]
Peter: Uh... Uh... Yeah, yeah.
[He closes the laptop, revealing a diagram of a simple gravity pendulum.]
Peter: Uh... Mass cancels out, so it’s just gravity times sine.
Ms. Warren: Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn’t always the best if you are wrong.
[The class bursts out in laughter. Flash has turned in his seat and is glaring at Peter.]
Flash: (whispers) You’re dead.
[Peter turns to glance at a clock. 11:38 a.m.]


[When Peter faces the front, we see that he is now wearing safety goggles.]
Mr. Cobbwell: Today we’ll be talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr, but trust me, there is nothing Bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.
[As Mr. Cobbwell continues on his introduction on Bohr, Peter opens his notes to a page titled “Web Fluid Version 3.01.” We see molecule diagrams and a list of liquids such as salicylic acid, toluene, and methanol.]
[Inside an open drawer is a beaker. Peter quickly and surreptitiously pours some orange liquid in it and stirs the concoction. It starts to increase in volume, running over the beaker walls. When Peter lifts the glass stirring rod, the compound sticks to it like spiderweb. Flustered, Peter quickly shuts the drawer and looks at the clock. It’s 12:35 p.m.]


[A homecoming banner is hung over the clock on the cafeteria wall by Liz, who is standing on a ladder. Peter and Ned are sitting next to each other and watching her.]
Peter: Did Liz get a new top?
Ned: No. We’ve seen that before, but never with that skirt.
[A girl passes by and says hello to Liz.]
Girl: Liz, hey.
Liz: Hi!
Girl: That looks so good!
Peter: We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.
Michelle: Too late.
[Peter and Ned turn to see Michelle sitting at the other end of their table.]
Michelle: You guys are losers.
Ned: But then why do you sit with us?
Michelle: Because I don’t have any friends.


[A poster hangs on the auditorium wall. It is for the Academic Decathlon nationals taking place in Washington D.C. on October 13-15. The Decathlon practice is commencing. Liz is standing at a podium, reading the quiz cards. Ned, Charles, Abe, and Cindy are seated on the stage. Bells are placed in front of them.]
Liz: Let’s move to the next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?
Charles: Hydrogen’s the lightest. That’s not the question. Okay. Yeah.
Abe: Uranium.
[Cindy Moon, who was frantically searching the books, glares at Abe.]
Liz: That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.
Abe: (quietly pumping his fist in the air) Yes.
Liz: Please open your books to page ten.
[A few feet away, Peter is conversing with Mr. Harrington, the teacher who is in charge of the Decathlon team.]
Mr. Harrington: Peter, it’s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off?
Peter: I can’t go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me, then I have to make sure that I’m here.
Flash: You’ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark.
[Flash speaks up from behind them, reading a book with his feet propped up in a chair.]
Cindy: Wait, what’s happening?
[Sally Avril, who is lying on her stomach and studying her notes, answers her.]
Sally: Peter’s not going to Washington.
Cindy: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No.
[Abe rings the bell beside her.]
Abe: Why not?
Liz: Really? Right before nationals?
Michelle: He already quit marching band and robotics lab.
[Everyone looks at Michelle, who is leaning on the wall with a book, with a suspicious look on their faces. Michelle quickly adds:]
Michelle: I’m not obsessed with him. Just very observant.
Liz: Flash, you’re in for Peter.
Flash: Ooh, I don’t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.
[Abe rings the bell.]
Abe: That is false.
Mr. Harrington: What did I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?
[Peter turns to see the clock: it’s still 1:18 p.m.]


[We see quick glimpses of Peter fidgeting as he looks at the clock. Fingers drumming the desk, foot tapping on the floor until finally, the clock hits 2:45 p.m. and the school bell rings.]


[The bell barely stops ringing before Peter reaches the front steps of the building. Looking around to check if anyone’s watching him, he leaps over a fence taller than himself without touching it.]


[Peter runs toward a deli and nods at a man sitting at the corner.]
Peter: Hey, what’s up?
Man: Hey, man.


[Peter enters Delmar's Deli-Grocery and heads to the counter. He seems like he’s quite a regular at the store.]
Peter: What’s up, Mr. Delmar?
Mr. Delmar: Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right?
[Peter picks up jelly in a plastic bag and puts it on the counter. It says ""Best By 03.16.18.""]
Peter: Yeah, um, and, uh, with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.
Deli Clerk: You got it, boss.
Mr. Delmar: How’s your aunt?
Peter: Yeah, she’s alright.
[Mr. Delmar turns to speak to his staff in Spanish.]
Mr. Delmar: La tía de é les una italiana muy bellissima. (His aunt is a very hot Italian woman.)
Deli Clerk: ¿Ah, sí? (Oh, yeah?)
Peter: ¿Cómo está tu hija, eh? (How is your daughter, huh?)
[The deli staff hoots behind the counter. Delmar’s grin fades.]
Mr. Delmar: Ten dollars.
Peter: It’s five dollars.
Mr. Delmar: For that comment, ten dollars.
Peter: Hey, come on, I’m joking. I’m joking.
[Peter pulls out some cash from his wallet and hands it over to Delmar. Delmar takes the money with a grumpy look on his face.]
Peter: Here’s five dollars.
[Peter moves toward a fat cat lying on the counter and pets him.]
Peter: What’s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy?
[When he returns to collect his food, Mr. Delmar strikes up a conversation.]
Mr. Delmar: So, how’s school?
Peter: Ah, you know, it’s boring. Got better things to do.
Mr. Delmar: Stay in school, kid. Stay in school. Otherwise, you’re gonna end up like me.
Peter: This is great.
Mr. Delmar: Best sandwiches in Queens.
[He hands Peter his sandwich.]


[Peter leaves the store and runs across the street with a bag of sandwich in his hand. He passes under an elevated train track, holding up his palm at a cab that honks at him, and runs into an alley. He takes off his shoes and throws them aside. He seems to be in a hurry.]
[From his backpack, Peter pulls out a blue and red Spider-Man suit. He knocks over a garbage can as he awkwardly takes off his pants. Peter yanks off his shirt and sweater, then steps into his suit, wearing only his boxers. Jumping, he pulls the full-body suit up over his legs. Peter fits his arms in the sleeves, then puts on the mask, which covers his entire head. The baggy suit hangs loosely over his slender frame.]
[Peter webs his backpack against a dumpster, then hits the spider emblem on his chest. The material shrinks, fitting him snugly.]
[Peter presses a button on his web-shooter, activating hologram displays, adjusts the lenses on his high tech mask, and jumps onto the roof of a building. “Blizkrieg Bop” by Ramones starts to play as he leaps across roofs with his sandwich bag in hand. Crouching down on a ledge, he looks down at the streets and sighs.]
Peter: Ah, finally.
[A bicycle chain is broken. The thief rides the stolen bike down a sidewalk, pushing passersby off the street. Peter swings after him, lands in front of him, and holds out one end of a strand of web.]
Peter: Hey, could you hold this for a second? Thanks.
[When the thief looks down at his hand, Peter uses his momentary distraction to glue him to the web. Peter lets go and the thief is pulled into the air. The thief still dangling above him, Peter holds up the bike and searches for its owner.]
Peter: Hey, is this anybody’s bike? No?
[A man comes out of a store.]
Peter: Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
Man: I have no change.
Peter: Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?
[On the handle of the bike, Peter has left a note saying: “IS THIS YOUR BIKE? IF NOT, DON’T STEAL IT! SPIDER-MAN.”]
[Peter swings by a train station high above ground level and strikes a pose.]
Peter: Whoo! Everybody good?
[He then rides on top of a subway car, reading something on his phone.]
[Peter is slowly standing up on the edge of a building, the flag of the United States billowing in the wind behind him, when a man calls out:]
Street Vendor: Hey! You’re that spider guy on YouTube, right?
Peter: Call me Spider-Man!
Street Vendor: Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.
[Peter does a backflip on the roof.]
Street Vendor: Yeah!
Man: Not bad.
[One moment, Peter is swinging down from rooftops and yelling, and another moment, he is patiently giving directions to an old woman. A thin strand of web suspended between a building and an old, rusty water tank, he practices his tightrope skills, too.]
[A man tries to open a car door with a thin slab of metal. Peter sees this, jumps onto the roof of the car, then uses his web to bang the man’s head on the car. The car starts to make loud beeping noises.]
Peter: Hey, buddy. Shouldn’t steal cars. It’s bad.
[Peter glues the man’s hand to the car and jumps off.]
Car Jacker: It’s my car, dumbass!
[An old woman, Marjorie, looks out from her window and starts to shout at Peter. All hell breaks loose.]
Marjorie: Hey! Shut that off!
Peter: I was just tryin’ to-
Car Jacker: Can you tell him it’s my car?
Day Sleeper: I work at nights! Come on, dude!
Old Man: That’s not your car! That’s his car.
Peter: How was I supposed to know? He was putting that thing in the window!
Resident 1: Every day with these damn alarms!
Resident 2: Shut it off!
[The neighbors continue to shout at Peter. An old, white-haired man wearing sunglasses (Stan Lee cameo) shouts at Peter, but then Marjorie notices him from the building across the street.]
Gary: Don’t make me come down there, you punk!
Marjorie: Hey, Gary. How you doing?
Gary: Marjorie, how are you? How’s your mother?
[Later. Peter swings through an alley. His grip on his web slips, causing him to fall on his face.]
Peter: Ugh! I’m good, I’m good.
[Later. The sun is setting]
Voicemail: You have reached the voicemail box of...
Happy: Happy Hogan.
[We find Peter perching on a fire exit high above the ground and munching on his sandwich.]
Peter: Hey, Happy! Um, here’s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn’t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. So I just, um, feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission is gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It’s Peter. Parker.
[Peter hangs up his phone and sighs.]
Peter: Why would I tell him about the churro?
[A warning signal blinks on his web-shooter. Web fluid low. Peter ejects the cartridge, then scrambles to catch it, standing sideways off the fire escape. He places the cartridge on his belt. And spots four men entering a closed bank.]
Robber 1: Can’t wait to see this thing, guys.
Peter: Finally, something good.


[Inside Queens Community Bank, a robber wearing a Hulk mask is cutting the ATM with a high tech tool that has a glowing Chitauri energy core inside.]
Robber 1: Yo, this high tech stuff makes it too easy.
Robber 2: Told you it was worth it.
Robber 1: Okay, go, go, go.
[Another robber uses a high tech device to grab and pull off the front of the ATM. The huge chunk of metal is suspended in air. Other robbers start to bag the cash.]
Robber 3: Oh, nice.
Robber 4: We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
[Behind them, Peter silently comes through the door and awkwardly tries to strike a casual but cool-looking pose.]
Peter: (clears his throat) What’s up, guys? You forgot your PIN number?
[The robbers turn to him. Reveal that they are wearing cheap plastic masks of the Avengers. The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron man.]
Peter: Whoa! You’re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here?
[One of the robbers loads his gun but Peter uses his web to grab it and hit “Iron Man” and “Thor” with it. He then proceeds to push “Hulk” away. His sticky feet hold “Thor” and throw him into a wall.]
Peter: Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you’d be more handsome in person.
[Peter is hanging upside down from the ceiling when “Iron Man” starts to throw aimless punches at him.]
Peter: Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You’re a billionaire.
[“Hulk” comes up with a high tech weapon. Peter quickly dodges a punch from “Iron Man,” who loses balance and ends up punching “Hulk” instead. They both fall to the ground. Meanwhile, “Captain America” succeeds in picking up the high tech device that had been used to pull the metal chunk off the ATM and aims it at Peter. Peter jumps at him but is suspended in air for a short time. His voice is all distorted when he says:]
Peter: Hey! Oh, this feels so weird.
[He is thrown against the wall.]
Peter: Whoa, what is that thing?
[He is once more caught in the force field of the device and is thrown back and forth between the ceiling and the floor.]
Peter: I’m starting... to think... you’re not... the Avengers!
[With his sticky fingers, he holds onto the ground and shoots his web at a desk in the corner. He pulls on it and hits “Captain America” with his force field device.]


[Mr. Delmar is watching the attempted bank robbery from his deli across the street; money flying everywhere, Spider-Man jumping off walls, the “Avengers” trying to fight him.]
911 Operator: 911. What’s your emergency?
Mr. Delmar: Uh... Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st street.


Peter: Alright guys, let’s wrap this up. It’s a school night.
[Peter kicks “Thor” into a glass wall, making it crack. “Iron Man” holds up the force field device, but before he can do anything, Peter webs the device against the glass, jumps onto “Iron Man,” and checks his face underneath the mask.]
Peter: So, how do jerks like you get tech like this?
[“Hulk” fires up the device that cuts through metal.]
Peter: No. Wait, wait, wait!
[Peter quickly pulls “Iron Man” and himself out of the way. The plasma blast cuts through walls and hits Mr. Delmar’s store across the street. The deli-grocery bursts into flames.]
Peter: Mr. Delmar.
[Peter quickly runs into the decimated store.]
Peter: Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in there? Is anybody in here? Hello?
[He helps Mr. Delmar, who is wheezing and coughing but alive, out of the burning building. Murph the cat is safe in Peter’s arms, too. But when he turns to the bank, he finds that it is empty. The robbers have escaped.]
Peter: Oh, come on. You’ve got to be-
[The cat starts to meow. Peter hands Murph to Mr. Delmar.]
Peter: Here, here.
Mr. Delmar: Good, yeah.


[Inside the Avengers Tower, Tony’s belongings are being packed up. Dum-E picks up an expensive-looking china vase.]
Happy: (to Dum-E) Okay. Good. Yes. Yes- No. No, put that down. That’s worth more than you or me. (takes a call) Yeah?
[Peter is running down a rooftop.]
Peter: Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons-
Happy: Hey, take a breath, okay? I don’t have time for ATM robberies...
Peter: Yeah, but-
Happy: ...or the thoughtful notes you leave behind. I have moving day to worry about. Everything’s gotta be out of here by next week.
[Peter jumps onto another rooftop, then stops in his tracks.]
Peter: Wait. Wait! You’re moving? Who’s moving?
Happy: Yeah, don’t you watch the news? Tony sold Avengers Tower. We’re relocating to a new facility upstate where, hopefully, the cell service is much worse.
Peter: But what about me?
[It is Happy’s turn to be confused.]
Happy: What about you?
[Peter sits down on a streetlamp.]
Peter: Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something, I don’t know, something big goes down? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark?
Happy: Look, just stay away from anything too dangerous. I’m responsible for making sure you’re responsible, okay?
[Peter leaps down into the alley he stashed his backpack in.]
Peter: I am responsible. I- Oh, crap. My backpack’s gone.
[Happy is now standing inside an elevator.]
Happy: That doesn’t sound responsible.
Peter: I’ll call you back.
Happy: Feel free not to.
[The elevator doors slide close as Happy cuts the call.]
[Peter puts his mask back on and runs out of the alley.]


[Peter climbs up his apartment building, still clad in his Spider-Man suit and dodging windows. He slides the top of his bedroom window open and looks inside. Aunt May passes in front of his open door.]
[Peter climbs into the bedroom via his ceiling and closes the window with his foot. He pulls off his mask, throws it away, and crawls across the ceiling. Trying to make no sound, he pushes the door close and hops down to the floor. We hear a quiet click as the door latch slides into place.]
[Peter makes a turn to find Ned sitting on his bed. Shocked, mouth agape. The Lego Death Star crashes to the ground and breaks down into pieces.]
May: What was that?
Peter: Uh, it’s nothing. It’s nothing!
Ned: You’re the Spider-Man. From YouTube.
Peter: I’m not. I’m not.
[Peter presses the spider emblem on his chest. The suit becomes baggy again and falls down from his body.]
Ned: You were on the ceiling.
Peter: No, I wasn’t. Ned, what are you doing in my room?
Ned: May let me in. You said we were gonna finish the Death Star.
Peter: You can’t just bust into my room!
[May opens the door, setting her hair free from a low bun. She waves a rag in front of her face to dissipate the smoke coming from the kitchen.]
May: The turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let’s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
Ned: Yes.
Peter: No. He’s got a thing.
Ned: A thing to do after.
May: Okay.
[She waves a finger at Peter, who is clad only in his boxers.]
May: Maybe put on some clothes.
[May leaves and closes the door behind her.]
Ned: Oh, she doesn’t know?
Peter: Nobody knows. I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that’s it.
Ned: (whispers) Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?
Peter: (hesitates) Yeah, basically.
Ned: Whoa...
Peter: You can’t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.
Ned: A secret? Why?
Peter: You know what she’s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she’s not going to let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, please.
Ned: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I’ll level with you. I don’t think I can keep this a secret. This is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me, Peter!
Peter: Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that’s happened with her, I... Please.
Ned: Okay.
Peter: Just swear it, okay?
Ned: I swear.
Peter: Thank you.
Ned: Yeah.
[Peter walks away, running his hands through his hair.]
Peter: I can’t believe this is happening right now.
Ned: Can I try the suit on?
Peter: No.
Ned: How does it work? Is it magnets? How do you shoot the strings?
Peter: I’m gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay?
Ned: Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the Stark internship?
Peter: This is the Stark internship.
Ned: Oh.
Peter: Just get out of here.
[Peter ushers Ned out, leans on the door, and facepalms.]


[Peter and may are sitting at a small table at Prachya Thai and eating dinner. May tries to make Peter talk, but he looks distracted.]
May: What’s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It’s too larby? Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say “larb” before you talk to me? You know I larb you.
Peter: I’m just stressed. The internship, and I’m tired. A lot of work.
May: The Stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark. Distracted all the time... he’s got you in your head.
[A news report on the television behind May catches Peter’s attention.]
News Anchor: The beloved Queens’ institution, Delmar’s Sandwiches, was destroyed...
May: What does he have you doing?
News Anchor: ...in an explosion...
May: You need to use your instincts.
[She becomes quiet as she turns to listen to the news reporter.]
News Anchor: ...earlier tonight after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens’ own colorful local crime-stopper, the Spider-Man. As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist, a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed.
[Aunt May turns back to Peter with a serious expression.]
May: If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way.
Peter: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
May: Six blocks away from us.
Peter: I... uh... I need a new backpack.
[May puts a finger to her ear, disbelief clear on her face.]
May: What?
Peter: I need a new backpack.
May: That’s five.
[A waiter brings a new dish to their table, his eyes glued on May.]
Thai Waiter: Sticky rice pudding.
May: Oh, we didn’t order that.
Thai Waiter: It’s on the house.
[The waiter winks, then leaves.]
May: Oh! Thanks. (to Peter) That’s nice of him.
Peter: I think he larbs you.
[At Peter’s joke, May points at herself with a exaggerated look of surprise.]


[The next morning, Peter is walking down the street with Ned, carrying a huge stack of thick books in his arms due to the loss of his backpack.]
Ned: You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would’ve hurt, right? You know what? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I’d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt?
Peter: The spider’s dead, Ned.
[Peter cuts the conversation short, allowing no room for further discussion on the subject. Ned shrugs and looks ahead. His eyes go wide.]
Ned: Whoa.
[Ned and Peter stop short, examining Delmar’s Sandwiches. It is almost burnt down, the store name almost illegible. Police tape and barricades surround the shop. Various police officers and crime scene investigators are working around it.]
Ned: You were here?
[Peter warily eyes the agents standing near the scene.]
Peter: Yeah.
Ned: You could’ve died.
[The teens stare at the badly damaged building. Expressions completely serious.]
Ned: Do you lay eggs?
Peter: What? No.
[Peter laughs at the absurd and anticlimactic suggestion.]


[In the middle of a chemistry lecture. A torch is boiling a dark-colored liquid on the desk. Peter and Ned are wearing safety glasses. Ned rolls over in his chair toward Peter, who is scribbling in his notebook.]
Ned: (in a low voice) Can you spit venom?
Peter: No.
Ned: Can you summon an army of spiders?
[Suppressing a sigh, Peter looks up in the guise of concentrating on the lecture and bends down again to take some notes.]
Peter: No, Ned.


History Teacher: The Sokovia Accords were put into place...
[Over Peter’s shoulder, we see a teacher droning on. Ned leans into frame and engages in a whispered conversation with Peter.]
Ned: How far can you shoot your webs?
Peter: It’s unknown. Shut up.
History Teacher: ...to begin regulating...
Ned: If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I could-
Peter: Shut up, Ned.
[Peter’s voice rises a little in volume. The girl sitting in front of Peter and Ned turns around and shoots them an irritated glare.]


[A small, old television is set up beside Coach Wilson, the PE teacher, who is standing with a bored expression. Captain America’s Fitness Challenge is playing on the screen. Captain America, in his full uniform, smiles pleasantly, standing in a locker room.]
Steve: Hi. I’m Captain America. Whether you’re in the classroom or on the battlefield...
[Midtown High students are sitting in neat rows on the bleachers, watching Captain America give a speech on screen. We close up on Peter and Ned. Behind them, Michelle is completely engrossed in a book called ‘Of Human Bondage’.]
Ned: Do you know him too?
Peter: Yeah, we met.
[Ned’s eyes widen in awe and his jaw goes slack.]
Steve: ...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.
Peter: I stole his shield.
[Peter boasts, feigning nonchalance. Ned’s jaw drops even more.]
Ned: What?
[Peter and Ned continue to watch the television with their classmates. We can see Captain over their shoulders.]
Steve: Today, my good friend, your gym teacher...
[Captain points to his right. Coach Wilson, who is apparently standing on the wrong side, waves his hand to the students.]
Steve: ...will be conducting the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
[He raises his hand in a salute. The screen transitions to ‘Station I: Sit-ups’.]
Coach Wilson: Thank you, Captain. I’m pretty sure this guy’s a war criminal now, but whatever. I have to show these videos. It’s required by the state. Let’s do it.
[Coach Wilson blows his whistle.]
[Midtown High School students are engaged in various exercises. Climbing ropes, doing chin-ups, push-ups, et cetera. Michelle is lying on a mat by herself and wielding her book like a weight, still immersed in its contents. We travel between students doing sit-ups in pairs.]
Ned: Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
Peter: Shh!
Ned: What does Hulk smell like?
Peter: Shh!
Ned: I bet he smells nice.
Peter: You have to shut up.
Ned: Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Peter: Ned, just, shh, okay?
[We finally find Peter lying on a mat and doing sit-ups. Ned is holding his legs in place for him.]
Ned: Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
Peter: What?
Ned: Yeah. You know how there’s a guy with a headset telling the other guy where to go?
[Peter’s face contorts into a weird expression. He is still doing sit-ups faster than any other student.]
Ned: Like, like if you’re stuck in a burning building, I could tell you where to go. Because there’d be screens around me, and I could, you know, swivel around, and... ‘Cause I could be your guy in the chair.
Peter: Ned, I don’t need a guy in the chair.
Coach Wilson: Looking good, Parker.
[The teacher points at Peter as he passes the mat that Peter and Ned are working out on. Peter glances at him, then frowns and takes a huffing breath, trying to look as if the exercise is really taking a toll on him.]
[On the bleachers, Liz is sitting with a group of friends.]
Betty: Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor, marry Iron Man, and kill Hulk.
Charles: Well, what about the Spider-Man?
Betty: It’s just Spider-Man.
[When the word “Spider-Man” reaches Peter and Ned’s ears, they stop and turn at the same time to see Liz and her friends.]
Liz: Did you guys see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
[Peter’s eyes go wide.]
Betty: Oh my God, she’s crushing on Spider-Man.
Charles: No way.
Liz: (shrugs) Kind of?
Betty: Ugh, gross.
[Ned and Peter exchange a look, surprised at the turn of events. Then they look back at Liz and her friends, still listening in on their conversation.]
Betty: He’s probably like, thirty.
Charles: You don’t even know what he looks like. Like, what if he’s, like, seriously burned?
Liz: I wouldn’t care. I would still love him for the person he is on the inside.
Ned: (in a loud voice) Peter knows Spider-Man!
[Peter looks at Ned, shocked. Mouth comically agape. Everyone in the gym simultaneously drops their assignments and stares at Peter. Peter hurriedly gets up and walks to the bleachers. Ned scrambles to his feet to follow him.]
Peter: (stuttering) No, I don’t. No. I... I mean...
[Flash, who was climbing up a rope, slides down to the ground.]
Ned: They’re friends.
Flash: Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends.
Peter: (stuttering) I’ve met him. Yeah. A couple times. But it’s, um... through the Stark internship. Mm-hmm.
[Peter turns to Ned, teeth set.]
Peter: Yeah, well. I’m not really supposed to talk about it.
Flash: Well, that’s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz’s party. Right?
Liz: Yeah, I’m having people over tonight. You’re more than welcome to come.
Peter: Having a party?
Flash: Yeah, it’s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.
Peter: Um...
Liz: It’s okay. I know Peter’s way too busy for parties anyway, so...
[Liz comes to Peter’s rescue, saving Peter from embarrassing himself even further. Flash saunters closer and walks by Peter.]
Flash: Come on. He’ll be there. Right, Parker?
[The bell buzzes. Tilting her head toward Peter in a tiny nod of farewell, Liz walks off. Peter, frustrated, throws his hands in the air and swivels to glare at Ned. He moves closer.]
Peter: What are you doing?
Ned: (in a hushed voice) Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you.
[Peter hesitates, searching for words.]
Ned: Dude, you’re an Avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it’s you.
[Ned walks away. Peter stands rooted in place, considering the idea.]


[May drives Ned and Peter to Liz’s house. Exciting, upbeat music pours out from the house. May slows her car and talks to the boys.]
May: House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
Ned: It’ll be a night to remember.
May: (laughs) Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.
Ned: Yeah, it gives me confidence.
May: Hmm.
[Peter is looking out the window, removed from the merry conversation taking place beside him.]
Peter: This is a mistake. (to May) Hey, let’s just go home.
May: Oh, Peter. I know. I know it’s really hard trying to fit in with all the changes your body’s going through. It’s flowering now.
[The absurd, out-of-place speech makes Peter chuckle.]
Peter: Uh-huh.
May: (to Ned) He’s so stressed out lately.
Ned: What helps with stress is going to a party. We should go to the party.
Peter: Yeah, let’s do it. Yeah. I’m gonna go. I’m gonna go.
[Peter opens the car door and steps out.]
May: Peter.
[When Aunt May calls his name, Peter stops and leans in to listen to his aunt through the window. Ned gets out behind them.]
May: Have fun, okay?
Peter: (nods) I will.
May: (in a soft voice) Okay.
Ned: Bye, May!
[Ned waves with a huge grin on his face. Peter closes the door and catches up to him. They approach the house side by side.]
Ned: Dude, you have the suit, right?
[Peter pulls up his sleeve in order to offer Ned a glimpse of his Spider-Man suit under it.]
Peter: Yeah.
Ned: This is gonna change our lives.
[The front door opens, revealing Peter and Ned. They enter the crowded house party and glance around anxiously. Peter looks especially nervous. Two girls pass by in front of them, not taking any interest in their arrival.]
Girl: Annie, over here!
Annie: Hey.
[Flash is running a DJ station. Ostentatious in headphones and a yellow shirt.]
Male Voice: DJ Flash!
Ned: Okay. We’re gonna have Spider-Man swing in, say you guys are tight, and then I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Michelle: Can’t believe you guys are at this lame party.
[Michelle carelessly throws her hair back, trying to act cool. She is in the process of spreading jam on a slice of toast.]
Ned: But you’re here too.
Michelle: Am I?
[The toast crunches as Michelle takes a bite out of it and walks away.]
Liz: Oh, my gosh.
[When Peter hears Liz’s voice, his eyes go wide. He turns his head towards the sound. Liz walks down the hallway to Peter and Ned.]
Liz: Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
Ned: Hi, Liz.
Peter: Hi, Liz.
[Peter’s high-pitched and squeaky voice betrays his nervousness.]
Liz: I’m so happy you guys came. There’s pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
Peter: What a great party.
Liz: Thanks.
[The sound of glass breaking catches their attention.]
Liz: (sheepish) Oh, I... My parents will kill me if anything’s broken. I gotta-
Peter: Yeah.
Liz: Have fun.
Ned: Bye.
Liz: Bye.
[Liz walks away.]
Ned: Dude, what are you doing? She’s here. Spider it up.
Peter: No, no, no. I can’t... I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I’m just gonna... be myself.
Ned: (sighs) Peter, no one wants that.
Peter: Dude.
[Peter starts to walk away, a little bit hurt by the remark.]
Flash: (into a microphone) Penis Parker, what’s up?
[Flash plays a honking sound on the stereo system.]
Flash: So, where’s your pal Spider-Man? Let me guess. In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?
[Honking noise again. Everyone around them laughs except Peter and Ned.]
Flash: That’s not Spider-Man. That’s just Ned in a red shirt.
[The crowd boos and chuckles. Peter frowns, determined.]


[A shirt drops to the floor and joins the already discarded pairs of jeans and shoes. Peter is standing on a roof. He steps over his clothes, wearing his Spider-Man suit, pulls off his T-shirt. As he mutters to himself, he tries to find a way to make his voice sound different.]
Peter: Hey, what’s up? I’m Spider-Man. Just thought I’d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what’s up, Ned? Hey, where’s Peter, anyways? He must be around...
[Peter sighs, watching the party through glass walls with a discouraged look.]
Peter: God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
[Peter spots Ned looking for him. Then something catches his eyes. A bright blue explosion in the distance. He stands, staring at it with concern.]
Peter: What the hell?
[Peter runs across the roof and puts on his mask. Shooting webs through trees, he swings down the street.]
[He lands on another roof, flips off the house, then shoots a thin line of spiderweb over a vast golf course. It flies off, having nothing to attach itself to. Wide shot on Peter running across the golf course. The sprinklers are activated.]
Peter: (gasping) This sucks!


[Beside a bridge, we see a discarded car, scraps of metal ripped out from it. A blue ray shoots through the air at a great speed towards it. The car blows up in a huge explosion and makes the shooters cringe in surprise. One of them hoots and laughs as bolts of electricity burst out from the explosion.]
[Jackson Brice powers down the weapon. The fingers sticking out from the end of the gun curl in on themselves, forming a loose fist.]
Brice: Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia. Here. You try.
[Brice hands over the weapon to Aaron Davis, who takes it.]
Aaron: Man, I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
[Behind them, Peter silently crawls down the side of the bridge.]
Brice: Okay, okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
[Hiding, Peter watches as Brice walks up to his van and looks inside. Spider-Man’s eyes narrow. The back of the van is full of machinery and weapons.]
Brice: Okay, I got, uh, black hole grenades, Chitauri railguns...
Schultz: You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We’re the only ones selling these high tech weapons.
Peter: (whispers) Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.
Aaron: I need something to stick up somebody. I’m not trying to shoot them back in time.
Brice: I got anti-grav climbers.
Aaron: Yo, climbers?
[Suddenly, a yodeling ringtone plays. The weapon dealers look around, alarmed.]
Brice: Okay, what the hell was that?
[The phone continues to ring. Peter takes his phone out to check caller ID. Ned is making a funny face on the screen. Schultz aims his gun at Aaron.]
Schultz: Did you set us up?
Aaron: Hey, hey, man.
[Peter flips off the wall and lands on the ground.]
Peter: Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.
Schultz: All right.
[Schultz turns the gun on Peter, but Peter shoots his web, disarms Schultz, and charges. Using a high tech gauntlet from his van, Brice punches Peter with a burst of energy. Peter slams into the side of the bridge and lands on the ground.]
[Schultz jumps in and starts the car. Brice, laughing triumphantly, jumps onto the back of the van as his accomplice drives off.]
Peter: What was that?
[Peter shoots his web, attaching it to the weapon dealers’ open van door.]
[The van drags in through a neighborhood, knocking Peter into a trash can.]
Peter: What? Ah!
[He shoots a second strand of web.]
Schultz: We gotta call him.
Brice: No, no, no, no.
[Brice readies another high tech weapon. Outside, Peter is holding on with two thin lines of web, trying to maintain balance. Brice fires another burst of energy. It breaks off the van door.]
Schultz: Did you just do it again?
Brice: Shut up.
Schultz: I’m calling him.


[We see a phone buzzing on a table littered with computer chips and various tools. Mason picks it up. Glancing around, he answers it.]
Mason: Toomes’ phone.
[He cringes at the sound of combat coming from the other end. Toomes is working nearby, welding something, when Mason calls for him.]
Mason: Boss.


[Peter is still being dragged through the neighborhood, clinging to the back of the van.]
Peter: Oh, my butt! Unh!
[Brice powers more energy blasts at Peter, causing him to lose his grasp on one of the webs. Just as Brice powers up the weapon once more, the van meets a road bump. The whole car wobbles, making Brice accidentally fire a hole in the van. He drops the weapon and it rolls out of the vehicle. The weapons comes to a stop in someone's yard.]
[Schultz makes a sharp turn, making Peter slam into the side of a parked car. Peter then gets dragged through a line of garbage bins. He hits a solid brick pillar and drops to the ground along with a heap of bricks. Peter’s webs break off. Schultz checks the side mirror. Peter has recovered from the collision. He runs to get a clean shot and extends his hand. The web travels through the air and attaches itself to the remaining van door, but the door breaks off, already weakened by the rough treatment it received. Peter throws his arms up, exasperated.]
Peter: Great. Guess I’m gonna have to take a shortcut.
[Peter jogs on the sidewalk, jumps over a tall metal gate, and slides over a parked car. Two men are playing ping-pong in a garage as Peter runs across the yard.]
Peter: Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
[The neighbors stop their game and gape after Spider-Man in disbelief. A dog runs into Peter, barking and standing on its hind legs to lick Peter’s face. Peter retrieves a ball with his web and throws it to the side for the dog.]
Peter: Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
[Peter swings through the neighborhood, hanging on tree branches and streetlights.]
Peter: Whoo! Now, this is more like it.
[He glides into another yard. Shooting his web, he accidentally holds onto a treehouse and knocks it off the tree. That makes him lose his grasp and land hard on the roof of a shed. It collapses under his weight.]
Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[After a few awkward banging noises, Peter rips through the door, runs across the yard, and slams through a wooden fence. He leaps into the air only to land on a small toy car, which rolls forward. Losing his balance, Peter gets tangled in a soccer net and stumbles through the hedge.]
Peter: Whoa.
[He waves his hand to a man having a barbecue in his own backyard.]
Peter: Smells really good!
[“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” is playing on the television at a pool party, the sequence closely resembling Peter’s travel through the neighborhood. Suddenly, Peter flies into frame.]
Peter: Great movie!
[Peter skims over the pool, splashing water over the partygoers and making them scream in surprise. He then gets tangled in fairy lights and crash lands on another yard, right beside two little girls having a sleepover in a tent. The eyes on his mask malfunction, fluttering open and close in a creepy fashion.]
Peter: Ugh... Oh, hey, guys.
Tent Kids: Aahhh!
Peter: No! No!
[The tent flips over in the girls’ overzealous attempt to escape.]


[Ned stealthily brings his phone up to his ear, only to reach Peter’s voicemail.]
Peter: (on recording) Hey, it’s Peter. Leave a message.
[The phone plays a beeping tone.]
Ned: (whispers) Peter, where are you? The hat’s not working. This is not cool.


[The van zooms down the suburban street. Smoke is billowing out from the back of it. Peter falls from above, narrowly missing the car.]
Peter: Almost got you.
[He knocks over some garbage bins in his attempt to leap up onto a roof. Running across the roofs of neighboring houses, Peter tries his best to keep the van in sight. Slates become loose and fall off the roof under Peter’s feet.]
Peter: (panting) Thought you got away from me, didn’t you? I got you right where I want you.
[Finally catching up, Peter jumps toward the van.]
Peter: Surprise!
[Suddenly, Vulture snatches him from behind, flying in the wing suit, and soars high. Peter screams, looking down.]
Peter: What the hell?
[Peter wrestles to pull his leg free from Vulture’s grasp. Noticing the struggle, Vulture trains his glowing eyes at Peter menacingly and carries him even higher. Suddenly, the spider drawn on the back of Peter’s suit starts to beep and blink. A parachute unfolds itself from the hidden compartment. The air resistance from it makes rips Peter from Vulture’s grasp. During his descent, Peter gets wrapped up in the fabric.]
Peter: Aahhhh!
[Peter’s chaotic point of view shows him plunging toward the city.]
[Peter plunges into a lake. He struggles to free himself from the parachute as he sinks deeper and deeper.]
[Up above, the surface is calm, not betraying Peter’s desperate fight underwater. A figure dives into the water in an admirably fast speed. Iron Man emerges, carrying Peter. Holding him under his arms. Peter’s head hang slumped. The eyes on his mask blink open.]
Peter: Huh? Oh, hey.


[Peter wrings his mask. Water drips from it. He is sitting on a jungle gym. In front of him, Iron Man is floating in the air.]
Peter: And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How’d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?
Tony: I put everything in your suit. Including this heater.
Peter: Whoa!
[The suit is dried instantly. Steam rises from it, surrounding Peter.]
Peter: Whew, that’s better. Thanks.
[Peter shivers, his teeth chattering.]
Tony: What were you thinking?
Peter: The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Tony: Take him down now, huh? Steady, Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.
Peter: The Avengers?
Tony: No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade.
Peter: Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn’t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine.
Tony: Oh, I’m not here.
[Iron Man’s helmet opens, revealing an empty space where Tony’s face should have been.]
[We are in India. Tony is dressed in a white kurta and wearing a red scarf around his neck. Behind him, Indian women in saris and garlands are participating in a traditional wedding.]
Tony: Thank God this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you’re at it.
[A man brings Tony a drink. Tony makes a small toast, whispering his gratitude.]
Tony: Cheers.
[Tony continues to talk through the empty suit, his helmet still open.]
Tony: Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.
Peter: Why?
Tony: Why? Because I said so!
[A woman walks to him. Tony demurely bends down in order to help her put a flower garland around his neck.]
Tony: Sorry, I’m talking to a teenager. (to Peter) Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can’t you just be a friendly...
[Tony takes a sip from his drink and puts it down with a clink.]
Tony: ...neighborhood Spider-Man?
Peter: But I’m ready for more than that now.
Tony: No, you are not.
[The empty Iron Man suit closes.]
Peter: That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.
Tony: Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would’ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy.
[Peter hears a car engine revving.]
Peter: Are you driving?
[Tony gets in his car and shuts the door.]
Tony: You know, it’s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. (at his phone) End call.
[Tony drives off in his yellow Audi.]
Peter: No, I don’t need to go to col- Mr. Stark-
Friday: Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
[The Iron Man suit flies off. Peter mutters grudgingly.]
Peter: That’s awesome.


[Peter approaches an empty yard, wearing his mask again.]
Peter: (mutters) Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about?
[He stops walking, spotting something. Peter enters the yard and finds a piece of Brice’s damaged weapon that had fallen out of the vehicle. He crouches down to tentatively flip it over with his fingertips.]
Peter: Whoa.
[Peter finds the glowing energy core. His phone rings. Peter answers a call from Ned.]
Peter: Hey, man, what’s up? I’m on my way back.
Ned: Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn’t come. Listen to this.
[Ned pulls his phone off his ear and raises it into the air.]
Flash: When I say “penis,” you say “Parker.” Penis!
Crowd: Parker!
Flash: Penis!
Crowd: Parker!
[Peter can still hear Flash and his friends chanting in the background.]
Ned: Sorry, Peter. I guess we’re still losers. I’ll see you tomorrow.
Peter: I’ll see you tomorrow in school.
[Peter hangs up and carefully lifts the weapon. Metal and wires encase the glowing core. Peter looks up, determination clear on his masked face.]


[In Toomes' warehouse, Mason is working on a small device which is glowing with a purple hue similar to the core of Peter’s discovery. He blows on the end of the soldering tool and picks up a glowing cube. Mason throws the cube into a refrigerator, creating a rectangular portal. He reaches through it and grabs a drink.]
Mason: Whoa, whoa.
[The room shakes, making the cube parts fall off the refrigerator and closing the small opening. Toomes lands on the platform in his vulture suit. Stepping out of the suit, he walks down the stairs, stomping angrily.]
Toomes: Idiots. Idiots.
[He throws his helmet.]
Toomes: Idiots!
[A worker looks up at Vulture, alarmed.]
Mason: Boss. Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light?
[Vulture approaches Mason.]
Toomes: What’d I tell you about looking at my phone?
Mason: Oh, sorry. You left it out. You know I’m a curious person by nature.
[Toomes takes the phone.]
Mason: I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.
Toomes: Huh?
Mason: In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?
Toomes: You’re still on that? I told you, no. The answer’s no. Forget it.
[The badly damaged van pulls into the warehouse. Vulture and Mason look at it curiously. Brice appears from the back of the van, not bothering to open the nonexistent doors which got ripped out during their fight with Spider-Man.]
Brice: Whoo!
[Smiling, Brice takes off his hand-weapon and reaches Vulture.]
Brice: I mean, that was badass.
[Annoyed, Toomes walks toward Brice.]
Toomes: How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?
Brice: You said, move the merchandise.
Toomes: Under the radar. Under the radar! That’s how we survive. If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we’re through. You’re out there wearing that goofy thing, lightning up cars, calling yourself the Shocker. “I’m the Shocker. I shock people.” What is this, pro wrestling?
Brice: Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.
[Brice walks to a table and Vulture follows.]
Toomes: Look, look. I know you don’t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.
Brice: (mockingly) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Vulture stares at Brice, his expression cold.]
Toomes: You know what? I can’t afford your bullshit. Get out of here.
Brice: What?
Toomes: You’re done. You’re off the crew.
Brice: Yeah, all right. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know.
[Brice walks off.]
Toomes: Excuse me?
Brice: Um, I’m just saying...
[Vulture looks at Brice, properly annoyed.]
Brice: ...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.
Toomes: You know what?
Brice: What?
Toomes: You’re right. (to Mason, in a low voice) That work?
Mason: I don’t know.
[Vulture looks at Brice again.]
Toomes: I can’t afford that.
[Vulture picks up and fires the high-tech weapon which Mason was working on. A blue ray zaps Brice, burning him down to ashes. Brice’s gauntlet clatters to the ground. The weapon powers down. Vulture looks on, a little confused. Schultz eyes the ashes.]
Schultz: Damn.
[Still confused, Vulture speaks to Mason.]
Toomes: I thought this was the antigravity gun.
Mason: What? No, that’s that one.
[Mason points to another weapon. Dropping the weapon on the worktable, Vulture approaches Brice’s remains. He picks up the Shocker’s gauntlet and cleans off the ashes. He then tosses the gauntlet to Schultz.]
Toomes: Here. Now you’re the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.
Schultz: All right.
[Vulture walks off.]


[In shop class, Peter hits the weapon core casing with a hammer. The core emits purple light as it is partially freed from the metal casing.]
Peter: Oh.
[He starts to pull it apart. Ned joins him.]
Ned: Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Peter: Yeah, well, something came up.
[Ned spots the glowing core.]
Ned: Oh, what is that?
[Peter struggles to take the machine apart.]
Peter: I don’t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
Ned: Seriously?
Peter: Yeah.
Ned: Awesome.
[Peter looks at Ned at the absurd reaction.]
Ned: I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary.
[Peter gives Ned a look and continues to work at the casing.]
Peter: Well, look, I think it’s a power source.
Ned: Yeah, but it’s connected to all these microprocessors. That’s an inductive charging plate. That’s what I use to charge my toothbrush.
[Ned points at a complex-looking charging mechanism connected to various wires.]
Peter: Whoever’s making these weapons is obviously combining alien tech with ours.
Ned: That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey into this amazing-
[Peter is not listening to a word he’s saying. He brings up a hammer and hits the core really hard. The core pops out from its place, glowing. Peter and Ned immediately look at the teacher. The teacher is reading a book, sitting in his chair. He does not even spare a glance at the commotion they are causing.]
Mr. Hapgood: Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
[Peter and Ned turn back and look at the core which popped out.]
Peter: I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it.
Ned: We’ll go to the lab after class and run some tests.
[We see the core glowing on the table.]
Peter: Let’s do it.
[Peter and Ned share a complicated secret handshake.]


[Peter and Ned are walking down the hallway.]
Ned: First, I say we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer.
Peter: First, we gotta come up with a better name than “glowy thingy.”
Ned: You’re right.
[Schultz and Randy walk in. Peter spots them and freezes instantly.]
Peter: Crap.
[He throws himself behind a wall.]
Peter: (whispers) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[Ned looks around, then shuffles across the corridor to join Peter by a classroom window. Behind them, the chess club is peacefully playing a game. Peter peers around the corner.]
Schultz: High schools creep me out.
[Peter and Ned peer at them.]
Schultz: They got this funny smell, you know?
[Peter and Ned hide behind the wall again. They carry out a whispered conversation.]
Peter: Hey, that’s one of the guys that tried to kill me.
Ned: What?
Peter: Yeah.
Ned: We gotta get out of here.
Peter: No, no, no, no, no. I gotta follow them. Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.
Ned: Someone dropped you in a lake?
Peter: Yeah, it was not good.
[Schultz and Randy enter a classroom.]
Ned: (whispers) Peter-
Peter: (whispers) No. Stay there, Ned.
[Peter raises an arm to stop Ned and sneaks away.]
Ned: (whispers) Peter.
[Ned is left standing alone. Through the window, Brian ""Tiny"" McKeever notices him. He knocks on the window, making Ned turn around, startled.]
Tiny: What are you doing?
Ned: (in a normal voice) Nothing.
[Down the hall, Peter is trailing the two men. Ned tries to act nonchalant.]
Tiny: Oh.
Ned: Yeah. You good?
Tiny: Chess.
[Peter sneaks down a staircase into the classroom. Schultz and Randy are rummaging through the room.]
Randy: Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?
Schultz: It’s saying there was an energy pulse right here.
[Peter slowly walks down the stairs and takes off his bag.]
Randy: There’s no sign of the weapon. And even if it was here, now it’s gone.
Schultz: So are we.
[Schultz looks in Peter’s direction. We see no one there. An upside-down chair standing on the table shakes a little. Spotting the anomaly, Schultz gets closer, putting his hand on his gun. He crosses the room and pauses by the worktable, scanning the area. As the men head out, we tilt down to reveal Peter clinging under the table. He shoots a tiny robotic spider at one of the men’s shoes. It stealthily climbs up the man’s leg.]


[Sitting in Peter's room, Ned holds the web-shooter. It projects a hologram model of the city. Peter hops onto the bed next to Ned.]
Ned: This is so awesome.
Peter: I know, right?
[Ned pokes it and the model becomes more defined.]
Peter: They’re in Brooklyn.
[Later. Ned is still studying the hologram and Peter is hanging upside down, eating chips.]
Ned: Staten Island.
[Night has fallen. Ned lies on the floor while Peter works at his desk. Ned glances at the hologram.]
Ned: Leaving Jersey.
[With a shooter, Peter projects a characterized image of his mask on the wall.]
[Later. Ned now lies on the bed. The hologram model starts to beep. Startled, he sits up, wearing the Spider-Man mask. He grabs the hologram model next to him.]
Ned: They stopped.
[Peter pops into frame, hanging from the ceiling. He turns around, a little groggy, and eyes the model.]
Peter: Maryland?
Ned: What’s there?
Peter: I don’t know. Evil lair?
Ned: They have a lair?
Peter: Dude. A gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair.
Ned: (nods) Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it’s, like, 300 miles away?
[They simultaneously turn to face the Academic Decathlon poster.]
Peter: It’s not too far from D.C.


[Midtown High students are waiting by a yellow bus, dressed in their yellow uniform jackets. Peter runs toward them.]
Abe: Hey, it’s Peter.
Peter: Guys.
Liz: Peter?
Friend: Hey, buddy.
Peter: Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team.
[Flash, standing in the back, walks forward to face Peter.]
Flash: No, no way. You can’t just quit on us, stroll up, and be welcomed back by everyone.
[The teacher walks out of the bus.]
Mr. Harrington: Hey, welcome back, Peter. Flash, you’re back to first alternate.
Flash: What?
Abe: He’s taking your place.
[Michelle appears behind them, sans uniform.]
Michelle: Excuse me, can we go already? ‘Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner, so.
Mr. Harrington: Protesting is patriotic. Let’s get on the bus.
[Flash shrugs off his jacket and sullenly thrusts it into Peter’s arms.]


[The bus is travelling through the highway. 90 miles to Baltimore, 126 miles to Washington.]
Liz: Focus up, everyone. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
[The students are holding bells, focusing on Liz’s quiz. They ring their bells before answering.]
Cindy: The second law of thermodynamics.
Charles: Frank Sinatra.
Flash: Fort Sumter.
Abe: Flash is wrong.
Liz: Okay, guys, let’s focus. Next one.
Mr. Harrington: Liz, don’t overwork them.
Peter: Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.
Liz: Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Peter: Glad to be back.
[Peter’s phone vibrates. He takes it out to see that Happy is calling him.]
Liz: What is the current standard unit of radioactive-
Peter: Can I take this real quick? I’ll only be a sec.
Liz: Yeah, fine.
[Peter answers his call, moving to the back seats. As he passes by, Michelle stares at him curiously, looking up from her book.]
Peter: Hello?
[Happy is talking on the phone in the Avengers Tower. Behind him, workers are carrying things.]
Happy: Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?
[Decathlon practice continues in the background.]
Liz: Okay, focus up, everyone.
Peter: Tracker.
[Peter holds the phone away from his mouth and mutters.]
Peter: (in a normal voice) Uh, yeah. No, it’s just a school trip. It’s, uh, it’s nothing.
[Peter sits in the back of the bus, next row to Ned.]
Peter: Look, Happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy.
[Ned points at the hologram model.]
Peter: (whispers) That’s different.
[Happy looks suspicious.]
Happy: What’s different?
Peter: Nothing. Look, it’s just the Academic Decathlon. It’s no big deal.
Happy: Hey, hey. I’ll decide if it’s no big deal.
[Peter looks annoyed. He mouths, “what?”]
Happy: Sounds like it’s no big deal, but remember, I’m watching you.


[The bus approaches Washington D.C. Above the hotel entrance, we see a banner announcing the “United States Academic Decathlon.”]


[The Decathlon team arrives in the check-in area. We see the interior of the hotel which is filled with preparations for the Decathlon. The students and teacher look on in awe as they walk in. Liz is at their front, leading everyone.]
Liz: Everyone stick together.
Mr. Harrington: Yeah.
Charles: You kidding me? This place is huge.
Flash: I’ve seen bigger.
Abe: There’s a bird in here.
Peter: (to Ned) Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
Ned: Why?


[The door to Peter and Ned's hotel room closes. The do not disturb sign is hanging on its handle. Peter and Ned unpack, shaking various belongings like wires, the purple weapon core, toothpaste, and braces out of their backpacks. Peter connects a wire to the suit. Ned is using his laptop, complicated lines of codes flashing through the screen. Peter holds a flashlight with his mouth, working on his suit.]
Ned: Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit?
Peter: Uh, because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don’t really want Mr. Stark to know about it.
Ned: So you’re lying to Iron Man now?
Peter: No, I’m not lying. He just doesn’t really get what I can do yet.
[Ned warily eyes his friend. Peter removes the tracking device from the suit.]
Peter: Ah... Gotcha.
[He takes the flashlight out of his mouth.]
Peter: All right, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp.
[Peter sticks the device on a lamp, then gets back to the suit. Ned is still working on the laptop.]
Ned: There’s a ton of other subsystems in here...
Peter: Hmm?
Ned: (smirks) ...but they’re all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.
Peter: What?
[Peter hops up next to Ned and looks at the screen. The words “Training Wheels Protocol” are written in red. The codes declare that the protocol is currently active and that “Stark Industry Key Identifier” should be entered to disable it.]
Peter: “Training Wheels Protocol?”
[Ned chuckles.]
Peter: Turn it off.
Ned: I don’t think that’s a good idea. I mean, they’re probably blocked for a reason.
Peter: Come on, man. I don’t need training wheels.
[Peter steps onto his bed and jumps up and down.]
Peter: I’m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It’s not cool.
Ned: But you are a kid.
Peter: Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.
Ned: Peter, I just don’t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?
[Peter jumps down to kneel beside Ned.]
Peter: Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on.
Ned: I really don’t think this is a good idea.
Peter: (whispers) The guy in the chair.
Ned: Don’t do that.
Peter: Come on.
[Ned sighs and types reluctantly. A blue flash of light briefly pulses through the suit. Peter and Ned look at it.]
[Peter, wearing the suit without the mask, zips up his sweat shirt to hide it and puts on his hood. He peeks out the door and looks around. The corridors are quiet and empty.]
Peter: Yeah, the glowy thing, it’s evidence. Keep it safe.
[Ned picks up the glowing core.]
Peter: All right?
Ned: Okay, okay.
[Peter activates the tracker.]
Peter: They’re moving.
[Peter hurriedly walks out of the room.]
Ned: Be careful.
[As Peter tries to walk down the hall unnoticed, Liz approaches in a bathing suit.]
Peter: Hey, Liz.
Liz: (whispers) Perfect timing. We’re gonna go swimming. Come on, come on, come on.
[She waves the other students forward.]
Peter: (whispers) What?
[The teenagers sneak by, laughing quietly.]
Sally: Hey, Peter.
Cindy: Hi.
[Flash slaps Peter’s butt.]
Peter: Hey!
[Peter squeals in a high tone, offended.]
Peter: I was, uh... I was gonna go study, um, in the business center.
Liz: Peter, you don’t need to study. You’re, like, the smartest guy I’ve ever met.
[Peter looks at Liz, bewitched.]
Liz: And besides... Um, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.
Peter: Hmm?
Liz: Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so, I-I heard it in a TED Talk. And I read a coaching book.
[Liz smiles and nods.]
Peter: Wow, you really... This is really important to you.
Liz: Yeah. It’s our future. I’m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, eleven dollars. So get your trunks on and come on.
[Liz throws a candy bar at Peter in a smooth arc.]
Charles: Come on.
Sally: Come on.
Liz: I’m coming, I’m coming.
[Liz catches up with the others.]


[At an indoor swimming pool, the Decathlon teammates swim. Liz sits on a wall between the pool and a spa.]


[Wearing his suit without the mask, Peter watches Liz through a window on the roof. Liz playfully chats with her teammates. Peter sighs. Stepping back from the window, he tightens the straps on his backpack. Peter puts on the mask. A brief glow expands from the spider emblem on his chest.]
Suit Lady: Good evening, Peter.
Peter: Hello? Hello?
Suit Lady: Congratulations on completing the rigorous Training Wheels Protocol and gaining access to your suit’s full capabilities.
[We see Peter’s view from inside the spider suit, quickly changing to different view modes.]
Peter: Ah, thank you.
Suit Lady: So where would you like to take me tonight?
Peter: (stuttering) S, I, I, put a tracker on someone. He’s a bad guy.
Suit Lady: Tracker located.
[We see the spider suit tracking down the path that leads to the guy Peter is after.]
Suit Lady: Plotting course to intercept target.
Peter: Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for Decathlon, it’s fine.
[Peter swings from a web and lands on a truck. As the truck runs past, we see a banner that says “United States Academic Decathlon.”]


[Peter rides on a different truck, raging down the road. We see Peter in his spider suit crouching on top of the truck, with the dark night sky in the background.]
Suit Lady: One hundred meters from destination and closing.
[The truck roars past a patch of grass.]
Suit Lady: Jump now.
[Peter leaps off the truck and rolls down a grassy bank. He runs across the bank through the tall grass, approaching an abandoned gas station.]


Suit Lady: Detecting three individuals.
[We see Peter observing the gas station from behind his back. The station is dark, with a couple of trucks in its driveway. He stops and crouches to observe the gas station.]
Peter: (whispers) Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That’s so lame.
[Peter jumps, and climbs on top of the empty gas price sign.]
Peter: Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Suit Lady: Do you want to hear what they’re saying?
Peter: I can hear what they’re saying? Uh, yeah.
Suit Lady: Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
[The spider suit display closes in on the van and shows Peter the heat signals emitted from the men inside. There are three people in the van who are quietly speaking.]
Mason: I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is all my design.
Peter: Whoa, that’s so cool.
Randy: Can’t believe they’re still cleaning up that Triskelion mess.
Schultz: I love it. They keep making messes, we keep getting rich.
Mason: Target inbound.
Peter: Whoa, they’re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I’m gonna get a little closer so I can see what’s happening.
Suit Lady: Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
Peter: Uh, Enhanced Combat Mode? Yeah.
Suit Lady: Activating Instant Kill.
[The eyes of Peter’s spider suit turn into evil-looking tiny red dots.]
Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don’t want to kill anybody!
Suit Lady: Deactivating Instant Kill.
[The eyes switch back to their normal width and color. Peter jumps off the sign and falls on his face on the hard asphalt ground. Peter grunts.]
Schultz: Did you hear that?
Peter: What the hell just happened? What was that?
Suit Lady: You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.
[He fires web pellets from his shooter which land on the gas station sign.]
Peter: Suit lady, what’s wrong with my web-shooters?
[Peter runs to hide behind a sign.]
Suit Lady: Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode.
Peter: Why would I need rapid-fire?
Suit Lady: Would you like to see more options?
[We see Peter’s hands from his spider suit point of view. All kinds of webs are shown from which he can choose.]
Suit Lady: You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.
Peter: Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it.
[Inside the car:]
Schultz: You two wait right here.
Mason: Wait. You’re gonna want to turn on the dampers, though, or that thing will shatter your arm.
Schultz: All right. Where’s the dampers?
[Peter is still looking down at all the options for his webs displayed over his hands.]
Peter: That one.
Suit Lady: Great choice.
[One of the options turn red.]
Suit Lady: Would you like me to set this as your new default?
[Peter shoots an electrified web at a neon sign, making it blink on and off.]
Peter: No, no, no.
[Through the window, we see Peter struggling with his electrified webs. He keeps shooting, and the neon sign keeps flashing. The men in the car are oblivious.]
Mason: Push that in.
Schultz: Right here?
Mason: No, no, the other-
Schultz: This one right here?
Mason: Yeah, push.
[Peter runs behind the gas station, away from the truck, and leaps on some trucks to reach the roof of the building.]
Peter: What was that?
Suit Lady: Taser webs.
Peter: Taser webs? I don’t want taser webs.
Suit Lady: You seem to be very unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course?
[Peter sits on the roof to get a better look at the men.]
Peter: No, just... You choose.
Suit Lady: Sure thing.
[Inside the DODC convoy truck:]
DODC Central: Six-Alpha-Niner. Are you running on time?
DODC Driver: Copy, Central. Six-Alpha-Niner on schedule.
[Schultz, Vulture’s bald henchman, peers through binoculars. Three trucks are approaching the gas station.]
Schultz: I have visual.
Mason: Green light, green light.
[Peter spots Vulture flying overhead in his wing suit.]
Peter: Oh, that’s him.
[Vulture soars over a convoy of transport trucks. The suit’s eyes glow green in the dark.]
Vulture: Okay, I got eyes on the convoy. Pulling in behind the caboose.
Mason: Deploy anchors.
[Vulture fires cables onto the roof of the last truck. He drops a cube onto the trailer, which separates into four pieces. Arranged in a rectangle, they create a glowing portal through the roof.]
Vulture: Dropping down.
[Vulture detaches from his suit and falls through the portal, but the truck driver seems unaware of what’s happening.]
[Inside the van, Mason speaks into his walkie-talkie, surrounded by wires and screens.]
Mason: No outgoing distress signals. You’re all clear.
[We see Vulture’s green-filtered view of the inside of the trailer. Cage-like boxes contain exotic items.]
Vulture: Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.
[He rips off the door from a cage full of tech. Peter climbs on top of the trailer and touches the portal. His fingers go through.]
Peter: Whoa, cool. It’s some kind of matter phase shifter.
[Peter crawls down the ceiling as Vulture rises into view. Vulture kneels and zips a duffel bag.]
Vulture: Alright, coming up.
[Vulture jumps through the portal and onto the roof of the trailer. Peter shoots a web at Vulture’s bag, pulling it away.]
Peter: Hey, Big Bird! This doesn’t belong to you!
[Vulture’s green eyes glare intimidatingly in Peter’s direction.]
Peter: Oh, god.
[Vulture gets into his wing suit and soars toward Peter. Peter jumps over him and fires long, weak webs past Vulture.]
Peter: Suit lady, what was that?
Suit Lady: You told me to choose.
[Vulture attacks Peter and Peter tries to balance himself on the edge of the trailer.]
Peter: What? No, just set everything back to normal.
[Peter grabs Vulture’s duffel bag, and starts to tug.]
Suit Lady: Activating all systems.
[Peter rips the bag out of Vulture’s talons. He falls through the portal back into the truck. The portal cube is thrown off position by Peter’s movement. He immediately jumps up to get out but slams his head on the now solid roof. Peter loses consciousness. Cut to black.]


[Time seems to have passed, and Peter lies motionless on the floor of the trailer. The truck shakes to a stop, waking Peter up.]
Peter: Oh, my head.
Suit Lady: You appear to have a mild concussion.
[With a headache, Peter stands up with a hand to his head.]
Peter: Hey, so where am I right now?
[Peter looks around, but cannot figure out where he is.]
Suit Lady: I’m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors.
Peter: Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady. We’re gonna have to fight our way out of this one.
[Peter prepares himself to burst through the truck’s metal doors.]
Peter: Three, two, one!
[Peter smashes through the trailer doors, and finds himself in a huge warehouse full of containers. He looks around, on guard.]
Peter: What is this place? Suit lady, where am I?
Suit Lady: You’re in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard. The Damage Control Deep Storage Vault.
Peter: No. Seriously?
[Shocked, Peter puts both hands to his head. On the wall before him, “DODC-V05” is written in big black letters.]
[Time has passed. Peter is clinging to the horizontal crack of the massive doors as he tries to wedge them open.]
Suit Lady: The door will most likely remain closed until morning.
[Peter kicks at the bottom of the doors.]
Peter: (disappointed) Morning?
[Later. Peter is lying on a hammock made out of his webs.]
Peter: Hey, suit lady, I kind of feel bad calling you “suit lady,” you know? I think I should probably give you a name... like Liz. No, no, no. God, that’s... that’s weird.
[With one hand, Peter swings on a rope that is also made out of his webs, and lets go, dropping to the floor and lying down.]
Peter: What about Karen?
Suit Lady: You can call me Karen if you would like.
[Peter reads a book hanging upside down. His web is held between his feet and suspending him from the ceiling.]
Peter: Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
[Wings expand from under his arms. Peter gasps in surprise.]
Peter: What?
[Standing in front of an empty wall, Peter is now wearing his yellow Midtown high school blazer over his suit. The suit is flashing a laser spider man emblem on the wall. Peter is examining the options for his web.]
Peter: Maybe we should run that refresher course.
Karen: Ricochet web.
Peter: Ricochet web.
[Peter shoots a ricochet web on the wall and it immediately bounces back. He ducks to dodge the ball-shaped bundle of web.]
Peter: Whoa! Cool.
[Later. The wall is covered with patches of spiderwebs now.]
Karen: Splitter web.
[Peter fires two strands of web.]
[More time has passed. The wall is even messier.]
Karen: Web grenade.
[Peter jumps, and throws a small, metal-like ball of web.]
Peter: Web grenade!
[The web grenade explodes, and the web covers the wall even more.]
[Later. Peter jump ropes with a strand of web.]
[Later. Peter is lying face up on one of the trailers.]
Peter: Should I tell Liz that I’m Spider-Man?
Karen: Who is Liz?
Peter: Who is Liz? She’s.. heh. She’s the best. She’s awesome. She, uh, she’s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it’s kind of weird, you know? “Hey, I’m... I’m Spider-Man.”
Karen: What’s weird about that?
Peter: What if she’s expecting someone like Tony Stark? I mean, imagine how disappointed she’d be when she sees me.
Karen: Well, if I were her, I wouldn’t be disappointed at all.
Peter: Thanks, Karen. It’s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways?
Karen: Thirty seven minutes.
Peter: What? Thirty seven minutes?
[Peter sits up, unable to control the frustration.]
Peter: That’s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I gotta... I gotta get out of here.
[Peter flips off a container and walks into it. He sighs and takes off his blazers and his hoodie.]
Peter: There’s got to be something in here I can use.
[He opens Vulture’s duffel bag.]
Peter: Okay, let’s see.
[Peter inspects a wheel-shaped metal piece then throws it away.]
Peter: Nope.
[He pulls out a Ultron head.]
Peter: That’s awesome.
[The Ultron head makes a clanging sound as it is discarded on the floor. Peter holds a purple glowing object.]
Peter: Ah, hey, it’s like the glowy thing.
Karen: That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.
Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean, we’ve been carrying around a bomb?
Karen: It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.
[Peter finds his phone and tries to call Ned but can’t get any reception.]
Peter: No, no, no, no, no.
[Peter uses webs to swing to the warehouse doors. Clinging onto the doors, he starts banging and shouting, hoping someone would hear him.]
Peter: Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock.
[Peter hangs upside down from the ceiling next to the time lock close to the doors. He has opened the lock panel and is now putting in numbers. In his hands are a notepad and a pen.]
Peter: Okay Karen. Lower the voltage and run it.
Karen: Trial unsuccessful.
Peter: Okay, we’re just gonna have to try every sequence.
[Peter crosses out the wrong sequence on his notepad.]


[The sun is rising over the Washington D.C.]


[At the hotel, Ned waits in his room. Someone knocks on the door.]
Student: Ned, Peter, we’re gonna be late. Come on, let’s go.
Ned: Okay, hold on, hold on.
[Ned grabs the energy core.]


[Peter is still trying to override the lock. He yawns, then presses some buttons.]
Karen: Initiating trial 247.
[The massive warehouse doors groan as they open.]
Peter: It worked! It works!
[Peter swings out on his webs through the opening doors. Peter crawls on the ceiling outside, then drops on the trailer of a departing truck. He lies down as the truck passes an armed guard.]


[The students are entering the Decathlon venue.]
Moderator: Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.
[Ned hand his phone in to the security.]
Security: Thank you.


[Peter is standing on the back of a trailer truck. A ringing tone is heard in the background.]
Peter: Karen, you have to get me to Decathlon as fast as possible.
Karen: Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Peter: Right across the street from the Washington Monument.
[We see Peter holding his phone to his ear.]
Ned: Hey, it’s Ned. Leave a message.
Peter: Ned, call me back! The glowy thing is a bomb!


[At the Decathlon, the students are scribbling. We pan down to see the purple energy core glowing in Ned’s pocket.]


Karen: There’s a vehicle approaching on your right.
[Peter grunts, and climbs on top of the cargo.]


Moderator: We have now entered sudden death.
[The students prepare themselves, trying to be calm and placing their hands on their buzzers. Flash takes a deep breath, clearly nervous.]


[The scene cuts over to Peter as he leaps on a SUV.]


Moderator: The next correct answer wins the championship.
[Michelle hits the answer bell with a bored, impassive look.]
Moderator: Midtown Tech?
Michelle: Zero.
Moderator: That is correct. Midtown takes the championship!
[Ned hugs Michelle and she smiles. More Midtown students pile in for a group hug.]


[The Midtown High students are walking toward the Washington Monument.]
Student: We won!
Liz: You guys, I am so proud of you.
Flash: Told you we didn’t need Peter.
Ned: Flash, you didn’t answer a single question.
[Michelle is standing alone with a book.]
Mr. Harrington: Taking it all in, Michelle?
Michelle: Oh, yeah, I just... um, I don’t really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves.
Mr. Harrington: Oh, I’m sure the Washington Monument wasn’t built by-
[Mr. Harrington looks up at the monument. A park ranger wobbles his hand as a confirmation to Michelle’s words. Mr. Harrington purses his lips and walks away.]
Mr. Harrington: Okay. Enjoy your book.
Michelle: Thanks.


[Peter swings on top of a bus. Peter and Ned finally reach each other on the phone.]
Peter: Oh, Ned, you’re alive!
[Ned is at the Washington Monument, about to get a security check.]
Ned: (whispers) Peter, are you okay?
Peter: Ned, Ned, where’s the glowy thing, the glowy thing?
Ned: Don’t worry, it’s safe. It’s in my backpack.
[Ned puts his backpack down on the conveyor belt for an X-ray security scan.]
Peter: No, Ned, listen! No, no, Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous.
Ned: You missed the Decathlon. I covered for you.
Peter: Ned, listen to me!
Ned: We’re at the Washington Monument now. You gotta-
[Liz takes the phone from Ned.]
Liz: Peter, is that you?
Peter: Oh, hey, Liz.
Karen: Is that Liz?
[Peter jumps from the bus, tumbles on his back, and starts running.]
Peter: Please put Ned back on the phone.
Karen: You should tell her how you feel.
[Peter tries to put a word in edgewise but Liz ignores him and talks on.]
Liz: You freak! You are so lucky we won. You know, I want to be mad, but I’m more worried. Like, what is going on with you?
[Now at the Lincoln Memorial, Peter is running towards the Washington Monument.]
Peter: Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It’s really important!
Security: Miss, all items on the belt, please.
Peter: Liz, there’s something in Ned’s backpack! It’s really dangerous. Don’t let it go through an X-ray.
[Not hanging up, Liz puts Ned’s phone through the X-ray machine along with Ned’s backpack. Ned walks through the scanner, oblivious, and moves to collect his backpack. The X-ray scanner screen buzzes.]
Peter: Liz? Liz! Damn it.
[Peter keeps running, and the Washington Monument comes into view as he gets closer.]
[Ned puts on his bag. The students enter an elevator.]
Flash: Hey, Mr. Harrington, can I be the one to tell Peter he’s expelled?
[Outside the Washington Monument, Peter webs his backpack to a tree.]
[The elevator is steadily climbing upwards. The core in Ned’s backpack begins to glow.]
Tour Guide: The Washington Monument is 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone.
[The energy core erupts with light, breaking glass, and the tip of the monument cracks.]
[Peter arrives at the base of the monument.]
Tourist: Did you hear that?
Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no. Karen, what’s going on up there?
Karen: The Chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.
[The spider suit provides Peter a view inside the monument, and it is shown that several people are gathered inside the elevator.]
Peter: Oh, no.
Michelle: My friends are up there!
Peter: What? Uh... Don’t worry, ma’am. Everything’s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that’s tall.
[Peter runs through the crowd, leaps onto the side of the monument, and crawls up.]
[On the elevator, Ned drops his backpack. The small space is filled with smoke.]
Charles: Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling.
[A glowing, red crack cuts across the elevator ceiling.]
Liz: Just stay calm, everyone.
Abe: Oh, we are all going to die here.
[Michelle peers up at Peter. He’s climbing on the monument, and has gotten so high that he’s merely a dot seen from below.]
Karen: Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.
[Inside the elevator:]
Charles: We're freakin' screwed.
Tour Guide: Okay guys, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working.
[Peter is now panting.]
Karen: The safety systems are completely failing.
[The tour guide drones on in order to calm the students.]
Tour Guide: We're very safe in here.
[Outside the Monument:]
Karen: The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.
Peter: I'm going as fast as I can!
[Peter pulls himself up with double strands of web.]
[Park rangers open the doors to the elevator shaft. The tour guide opens a hatch in the ceiling of the car, and looks out.]
[Peter continues climbing.]
[Cindy is pulled out of the elevator.]
Park Ranger: Let's go. Give me your hand.
Karen: You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.
[Peter’s hands slip a little.]
Peter: What? Why?
Karen: Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.
[The spider suit shows the elevator. The park rangers rescuing the students are making the elevator move.
PETER
Peter: How do I get in there?
KAREN
Karen: Activating reconnaissance drone.
The emblem on Peter’s suit detaches, and the spider-shaped robot flies up, over the monument.]
Peter: Whoa, has that been there the whole time? That’s awesome.
Karen: Locating optimal entry point.
[The small drone finds a window.]
Karen: Proceed to southwest window.
Peter: Karen, I'm on my way.
[Peter moves around the monument, and continues climbing. Down below, people have started to gather to see what’s happening.]
[Inside, Abe peers down the long elevator shaft.]
[Peter reaches the top of the monument. Pausing, he turns onto his back and clings to the cracked stone.]
Peter: Ah!
[Cautiously, Peter peers over the edge to the ground far below.]
Peter: Okay. Oh, my god. Okay.
[He then takes panicky breaths and sticks to the wall.]
Karen: What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window. Why are you hesitating?
Peter: It’s fine. It’s just, I've just never been this high before.
[Peter tries to shoo away the seagulls perched on the windowsill. Karen’s voice is calm and kind as she informs Peter.]
Karen: You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.
[Peter moves on top of the windowsill and the seagulls fly away.]
Peter: Perfect. Oh, my god.
[Peter kicks the window.]
Peter: Why is it not breaking?
Karen: It's a four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.
[Peter shoots a web against the monument wall and rappels down the strand until his feet lie flat against the glass. Jumping, he swings against the window. The glass cracks slightly.]
[Police helicopters approach, guns ready. Speakers boom as a police officer speaks out.]
Police: This is D.C. Metro police. Identify yourself.
Peter: My friends are in there! My friends are in there! Stop!
Police: Return to the ground immediately.
[Inside the elevator:]
Mr. Harrington: Okay, who's next?
[Liz grabs Mr. Harrington’s shoulder, preparing to climb up.]
Flash: Me, it's my turn!
[Flash shoves Liz to get out first, and doesn’t give up the trophy.]
Ned: Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
Flash: Come on.
Cindy: Don't worry about the trophy.
[Flash climbs through the hatch in the ceiling of the elevator, and the car shakes.]
Students: Ah!
[Through the yet unbroken window, Peter is watching the students panic.]
[Peter stands against the window as police helicopters hover around him. An officer is aiming his gun in Peter’s direction.]
Police: Stand down! Return to the ground immediately!
[Peter is panting heavily, but he climbs to the top of the monument.]
Police: Return to the ground or we will open fire!
[The police officer follows Peter with the aim of his gun, but Peter disappears from his view to the other side of the monument.]
Police: (to the pilot) Go up, go up!
Peter: I got this.
Flash: Take my trophy!
[The car shakes again under Flash’s feet.]
Police: This is your last chance!
Peter: Oh, I'm gonna die.
[Peter jumps toward the closest helicopter and extends his web-wings, gliding over the menacing helicopter blades. He shoots a web at the skid, and swings toward the window.]
Peter: Break!
[The window shatters into pieces as Peter swings in, and the roof of the elevator is ripped off. The elevator starts to fall. Peter slides in toward the elevator shaft.]
Liz/Ned: Ahh!
[Peter shoots a strand of web onto the falling elevator, then braces his feet against the doors to the shaft. Liz, Ned and Mr. Harrington are jostled in the elevator as it is stopped.]
Peter: I did it! Whoa!
[The doors break loose, and Peter falls after the plummeting elevator. It catches on a beam and Peter falls in through the ceiling on his back. The impact breaks off a wheel and the car starts to drop again. Peter shoots a web through the hole in the ceiling, stopping the elevator’s descent. Hanging upside down with his feet braced against the ceiling of the elevator, Peter grabs on to the strand of web, and tries to make his voice sound different as he helps his friends calm down.]
Peter: Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don't worry about it. I got you.
Ned: Yes! Yes!
[Ned swings his fist in joy and relief, making the whole elevator wobble.]
Peter: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, big guy, quit moving around.
Ned: Sorry, sir. So sorry.
[Outside, a fire truck and an ambulance arrive.]
Park Ranger: Let's go, let's go!
[With his web attached to the ceiling high above, Peter slowly pulls the elevator up the shaft. They reach an upper floor.]
Park Ranger: Okay, okay.
Cindy: Mr. Harrington, go. Ned, come on.
Peter: Alright. This is your stop.
Ned: Come on, Liz.
[The metal elevator ceiling starts to bend under Peter’s feet.]
Peter: Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it!
Liz: Are you sure it’s safe?
[Liz reaches out, but before she can hold Mr. Harrington’s outstretched hand, the ceiling snaps.]
Mr. Harrington: Liz!
[Peter webs Liz as the elevator falls. She dangles by her wrist.]
Peter: You’re okay. You’re okay.
[Peter pulls her up by the web, then takes her hand.]
Peter: Okay.
[His web starts to snap as he helps Liz to safety.]
Students: Oh, my god. Good, good.
Mr. Harrington: Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. Come on in. Come on in.
Peter: So, uh, is everyone okay?
[Liz nods.]
Karen: This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her.
[Liz and Peter hold a look. The web snaps, and Peter drops. The students, the teacher, and the park rangers look down the elevator shaft going after Peter as he falls.]
Mr. Harrington: Thank you.
[Flash peers down the shaft.]
Flash: Are you really friends with Peter Parker?


[In Vulture’s warehouse, Schultz tries out the shocker gauntlet. He can move a whole van with the force of his punch. Mason sits at his work table, clutching his work when the table wobbles.]
Mason: I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck...
Toomes: Ugh, damn it. We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?
Mason: Yeah, but then that's it.
[Perching on the table, Vulture strokes his chin.]
Mason: Oh, maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.
Toomes: Would you shut up about that?
Mason: It's only one job.
Toomes: No.
[Schultz stands nearby.]
Toomes: Eight years, not a word from the Feds, nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built. Really?
[Vulture shrugs.]
Toomes: I’m gonna kill him. I'm gonna find him...
Schultz: I found him.
[On TV, the news shows spider man at the Washington Monument. The headline says “Man Spider Climbs Washington Monument.”]
News Anchor: Spider-Man swooped in, heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.
[Vulture’s expression is unreadable as he studies the screen.]


[At night, the students’ families meet them by the school bus. Liz’s mother hugs Liz.]
Liz: Mom.
Doris: It’s okay. Alright.
May: Peter?
[Aunt May runs to Peter and embraces him.]
Families: Come here, come here. Oh, my god.


[At school, the student news plays on a TV in the hall.]
Jason: This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team defeated the country's best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death.
Abe: (yells) Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screamin’.
Charles: (excited) There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere, It was...
[A cat emoji appears over Charles’ mouth and a beep is inserted as he swears.]
Charles: ...just like a bon Jovi concert.
Mr. Harrington: As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing. I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again.
[The camera amateurishly zooms in on Mr. Harrington’s face.]
Jason: Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, thanks to the Spider-Man.
Jason/Betty: (awkwardly) Thank you, Spider-Man.
Jason: Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit?
[Peter grins as he walks past the TV showing the student news. A few students are standing around the TV to watch the news. As Peter cheerfully enters another hall, Ned joins him.]
Ned: Dude, dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?
Peter: Crazy, dude.
Ned: It’s crazy. Should we tell everyone?
Peter: No.
Ned: Should I tell everyone?
Peter: No, dude, no, that’s not a good idea.
Ned: Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
Peter: I’m not going to class.
Ned: You’re already in so much trouble for ditching the Decathlon.
Peter: Dude, listen, I figured it out, right? The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control. And what he takes from Damage Control, that’s how he builds the weapons. So all I gotta do is catch him.
Ned: But we have a Spanish quiz.
Peter: Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here. Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate, so when I bring this guy in-
Ned: Dude, you want to be a high school dropout?
Peter: I am so far beyond high school right now.
Principal Morita: Parker, my office.


[At detention. A video plays, featuring Captain America. He pulls up a chair and sits.]
Steve: So... You got detention. You screwed up.
[Peter sighs and bites his lip in frustration.]
Steve: You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.
[We see the classroom is sparsely filled with students. Michelle is sitting in a seat behind Peter. Peter sighs again and stands up forcefully.]
Steve: We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something you know is wrong...
[Peter gets up and marches out past Michelle. Coach Wilson is slouching at a desk.]
Coach Wilson: (indifferently) Hey, where you going? Get back here.
Steve: Just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?
Coach Wilson: (to Michelle) Why are you here? You don't even have detention.
Michelle: Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis.
[Michelle holds up a sketch depicting Coach Wilson.]
Michelle: Heh. It's you.
Steve: So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels.


[In the empty hallway, Peter lifts a row of lockers off the ground, revealing a hidden space beneath. He grabs a bottle of web fluid and lowers the lockers. Peter throws the bottle up in the air, and catches it again.]


[Arriving home, Peter peeks in the front door.]
Peter: May?
[He checks the living room, which looks empty.]


[We are now inside Peter's bedroom. Peter is wearing normal clothes over his suit and lounging in his chair.]
Peter: Hey, Karen. What's up?
Karen: Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?
Peter: Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I mean, I can only kind of remember part of a license plate.
Karen: I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.
[A string of data appears in front of Peter’s eyes.]
Peter: Footage?
Karen: Yes, Peter. I record everything you see.
Peter: Everything?
Karen: Everything.
Peter: Like all the time?
Karen: It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.
[Peter throws away his pen in irritation.]
Peter: Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
Karen: With pleasure.
[Karen shows a footage of Peter fooling around in front of a mirror in his spider suit mask.]
Peter: (on video)Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you.
[The Peter in the footage winks.]
Peter: No, no, no. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day.
[Karen fast-forwards the video.]
Peter: (on video) It is I, Thor, son of Odin!
[Peter is doing impressions of Thor, holding a wooden hammer in his hand.]
Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no. That's definitely... no. That's definitely not what we wanted to watch. Just...
Karen: Your impressions are very funny.
Peter: Fast-forward to the arms deal.
[Peter stands up. The footage shows three men from the arms deal that Peter was searching for.]
Peter: Okay. The two on the right, who are they?
Karen: Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals.
Peter: Nothing?
Karen: One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens.
[The spider suit displays the criminal record of Aaron Davis.]
Peter: Let's pay him a visit.
Karen: Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Peter: Uh, yeah.


[In a parking building, the scruffy man from the weapons deal, Aaron Davis, carries groceries to his car. The spider drone follows him. As Aaron opens the trunk, Peter arrives in his spider man suit. He sticks Aaron’s hand to the trunk with a web. Annoyed, Aaron stares at the spider drone.]
Peter: Remember me?
[Peter speaks in a deep metallic voice. He approaches Aaron’s car, and Aaron seems taken aback.]
Aaron: Uh, hey...
Peter: I need information. You're gonna give it to me now.
Aaron: All right, chill.
Peter: Come on!
Aaron: What happened to your voice?
Peter: What do you mean, what happened to my voice?
Aaron: I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.
Peter: I'm not a girl! I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.
Aaron: I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...
Peter: I'm not a girl! I'm a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else.
[Aaron slams the trunk shut, and Peter startles. He steps back and looks around in surprise. The spider drone chirps and flies around Peter’s head.]
Aaron: You ain't ever done this before, huh?
Peter: Deactivate interrogation mode.
[The spider drone goes back in the emblem on the suit’s chest. Aaron laughs. Peter’s voice changes back to its high-pitched tone.]
Peter: Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can't just be out on the streets. Look, if one of them can just cut Delmar's bodega in half...
[Aaron is looking at his fingers, sniffing, not amused. However, when Peter mentions Delmar’s, he gains interest.]
Aaron: You know Delmar's?
Peter: Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
Aaron: Sub Haven's pretty good.
Peter: It's too much bread.
Aaron: I like bread.
Peter: Come on, man, please.
[Peter starts to walk away.]
Peter: Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.
Aaron: The other night, you told that dude, ""if you shoot somebody, shoot me."" It's pretty ballsy. I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here.
[Peter stops when Aaron starts speaking, and walks back to him.]
Peter: Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?
Aaron: Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don't know who he is or where he is.
[Peter leans his head on Aaron’s car, and gives out a sigh.]
Aaron: I do know where he's gonna be.
Peter: Really?
Aaron: Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with, he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.
Peter: Yes! Yes. Thank-
[Peter starts to walk happily away, giggling.]
Aaron: Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.
Peter: Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...
[Embarrassed, Peter comes closer and leans on the car.]
Peter: Yeah. Where is it?
Aaron: Can I give you some advice?
Peter: Hmm?
Aaron: You got to get better at this part of the job.
Peter: I don't understand. I'm intimidating.
[Peter demonstrates his “intimidating” pose, crossing his arms.]
Aaron: Staten Island ferry, eleven.
Peter: Oh, that's soon. Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours.
Aaron: No, no, no, no. Come fix this.
Peter: Two hours. You deserve that.
[Peter walks away, stabbing a finger in Aaron’s direction.]
Aaron: I got ice cream in here.
Peter: You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal.


[At the Staten Island Ferry terminal, Peter swings onto a building roof. As the massive orange ferry pulls out of the dock, he takes a running leap and spreads his glider wings. He lands and hangs on the hull.]
Peter: (grunts) Nice.
[He peeks through a window and sees passengers sitting inside.]
Peter: Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Karen: Sure thing.
Toomes: He’s up front. Main deck.
Schultz: I hate this guy.
Peter: It’s the guy from the bridge, right? Who’s that other guy?
Toomes: Just keep me posted.
Karen: There’s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from May Peter. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?
Peter: I can’t talk right now. I’ll call her back.
[He watches Toomes. The spider drone climbs onto his head.]
Peter: Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can’t let anybody get away this time.
[The drone hovers by the window. Peter climbs up to the ferry roof. He crawls to the edge and peers down at four men on the front deck.]
Peter: Who’s the guy on the left?
Karen: Mac Gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?
Peter: No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already.
[Schultz approaches Gargan.]
Schultz: White pickup truck.
[Gargan nods to a slim man who walks away.]
Peter: Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck.
[The tiny drone scans the cargo under the deck and spots a pickup truck. It hovers over the truck and scans its contents. Toomes’ coworker gets out of the car and leads the slim man to the back.]
Peter: Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers, and sellers all in one place.
Karen: Incoming call from Tony Stark.
Peter: No, no, no. No, no, don’t answer.
Tony: Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
Peter: Uh, I’m actually at school.
Karen: No, you’re not.
Tony: Nice work in D.C.
Peter: Okay.
Tony: My dad never really gave me a lot of support... And I’m just trying to break the cycle of shame.
Peter: Uh, I’m kind of in the middle of something right now.
Tony: Don’t cut me off when I’m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to-
[The ferry horn blares.]
Tony: What is that?
Peter: Uh, I’m at band practice.
Tony: That’s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What’s up?
Peter: I gotta go. Uh, end call.
Tony: Hey.
Peter: I’ll take those! (snatches a key chain) Yoink!
[He then leaps onto the deck.]
Peter: Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal-ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.
[He disarms two guys with the spiderweb, kicks Gargan, and slams him. Peter ducks from Schultz’s Shocker gauntlet, which gets caught in a gate.]
Randy: Spider guy’s here.
[Toomes leaves his seat. Two thugs get up behind Peter.]
Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.
[Peter throws them both.]
Peter: Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.
[He eyes Schultz, who is still struggling to free himself.]
Peter: I gotta say the other guy was way better with that thing.
[He then reloads his web-shooter.]
Peter: I’m honestly, I’m, I’m shocked.
[Peter shoots a web grenade behind him, attaching a thug to the wall with it. In the cargo hold, Toomes bashes the slim man’s head against the truck. He then faces Peter, who is standing yards away on deck. Suddenly, agents come out of nowhere and aim at Peter.]
FBI Agent 1: Freeze! FBI!
FBI Agent 2: Don’t move.
FBI Agent 1: Get on the ground.
FBI Agent 1: FBI.
Peter: Wait, what do you mean, FBI?
Karen: The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Peter: I know what the FBI means, but what are they doing here?
[A mechanical wing bursts out of the truck, making the agents turn to it. Toomes flies toward the deck in his vulture suit. Agents shoot at him.]
Peter: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
[Vulture fires a high tech weapon, drags a car, and throws it to the agents.]
Peter: Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!
[Vulture hits Peter, causing him to fall into the water. He then fires energy blasts at a man’s arm.]
Toomes: Get to the top deck. We’re getting out of here.
[Peter shoots his web at Schultz, but misses. He shoots the web at Vulture’s leg and pulls. Vulture hides behind his large metal wings that protects him from the gunfire, then shoots at the agents. One blast hits an indoor seating area. Peter weighs Vulture with a car attached to his web. Dodging a blast, he leaps to the upper deck and shoots some more web. Hanging from Vulture’s suit, Peter swings over the water. The flying man fires at Peter. He swings back onto the deck. Vulture cuts the strands of web with the blades of his wings. Peter shoots web at the barrel of Vulture’s high tech weapon.]
Peter: Activate Taser Web!
[Electricity travels up the strand of web and the weapon is yanked away from Vulture. On the deck, it bounces around wildly. Peter traps the weapon using lots of spiderweb.]
Toomes: You’re messing with things you don’t understand.
[The weapon’s laser beam breaks up into multiple rays. The energy blast cuts through the upper seating area, narrowly missing frightened passengers. In the air, Vulture dodges the blasts as they shoot into the sky. Schultz sprints toward an upper deck, leaps into the air, and lands on Vulture’s back. The rays slice through the length of the ferry, then vanish. In the seating area, passengers move cautiously. In the cargo bay, jets of water start to split up the ferry.]
Peter: Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, uh, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points.
[Peter’s display highlights spots on the structure.]
Peter: Web grenade. Web grenade.
[Shooting web, he leaps between the two sides of the ship.]
Peter: Splitter web, go.
[Peter tumbles back and forth on the upper part of the ferry, connecting the ship with strands of web. He dodges flames as he travels down the length of the ferry. Peter fires several strands of web and once, and binds them together with another strand. Reaching the bow, he crouches on the edge of the roof. He eyes the two leaning halves of the ferry that are crisscrossed with spiderweb.]
Karen: Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful.
Peter: Ninety-eight?
Man: Yeah, Spider-Man!
[The web strands begin to snap.]
Peter: No, no, no, no!
[Water floods the cargo hold, pushing the cars forward. People cling to posts as the stream rushes past them. On the upper level, passengers slide down the floor of the leaning ferry. The gap widens as the web strands continue to snap. Peter leaps into the air.]
Peter: No!
[He grabs a thread and shoots another. Arms outstretched, Peter hangs between the two sides, trying to hold them together.]
[Suddenly, the two sides start to move toward each other.]
Peter: What the hell?
[Peter lands gently in the seating area and looks around.]
Peter: What the hell...
[Iron Man rises into view.]
Tony: Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it?
[Hovering outside, he holds up one half of the boat. Drones arrive and attach themselves to the other half. Thrusters propel the two halves of the ferry forward and join them together.]
[Iron Man looks at Peter through the window, then flies off.]
Man: Yeah, Iron Man!
[Peter swings into the cargo hold, where Iron Man is welding the ferry back together.]
Peter: Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?
Tony: I think you’ve done enough.
[Iron Man flies away. Peter climbs to the top platform of a mast and looks around. Smoke is pouring out from the massive vessel. Rescue boats and helicopters approach from all directions.]


[Schultz is walking toward Vulture in the warehouse when he speaks out:]
Toomes: So that’s it, you’re just gonna run?
Schultz: Feds were waiting for us. Now we’re on Iron Man’s radar? Yeah, I’m running. You should, too.
Toomes: You know I can’t do that.
Schultz: So now what?
Toomes: Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?
Mason: Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this.
Toomes: (to Schultz) You in?
[Schultz smiles faintly and lifts his eyebrows.]


[Helicopters are still flying around the ferry. Peter is perching on the edge of a building, sans mask, when Iron Man flies over to him.]
Tony: Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch: I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do.
Peter: Is everyone okay?
Tony: No thanks to you.
Peter: No thanks to me?
[Angered, Peter jumps off the edge and approaches Tony.]
Peter: Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn’t listen. None of this would’ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you’d actually be here.
[The Iron Man suit opens, revealing Tony inside. He steps down from the suit and marches toward Peter, who backs off.]
Tony: I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
Peter: I’m fifteen.
Tony: No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? ‘Cause that’s on you. And if you died, I feel like that’s on me. I don’t need that on my conscience.
Peter: Yes, sir.
Tony: Yes.
Peter: I, I’m sorry.
Tony: Sorry doesn’t cut it.
Peter: I understand. I just wanted to be like you.
Tony: And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it’s not working out. I’m gonna need the suit back.
Peter: For how long?
Tony: Forever.
[Peter shakes his head with a shocked expression.]
Tony: Yeah. Yeah, that’s how it works.
Peter: No, no, no... Please, please, please...
Tony: Let’s have it.
Peter: You don’t understand. Please. This is all I have. I’m nothing without this suit.
Tony: If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad.
Peter: I don’t have any other clothes.
Tony: Okay, we’ll sort that out.


[Peter walks down the hallway of his apartment wearing pink Hello Kitty pajamas and an oversized NYC tourist T-shirt. He knocks on a door, which May answers.]
Peter: (whispers) Hey.
[May inhales deeply and storms inside.]
May: I’ve been calling you all day. You didn’t answer your phone. You can’t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I’ve called five police stations.
[Peter walks to May and stands behind her.]
May: Five. I called five of your friends.
Peter: I’m fine.
May: I called Ned’s mother.
Peter: May, I’m okay. Honestly. Just relax. I’m fine.
[May stands and faces Peter.]
May: You. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That’s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what’s going on. Just lay it out. It’s just me and you.
[A beat, then Peter’s eyes fill up with tears.]
Peter: I lost the Stark internship.
May: What?
Peter: Yeah.
May: What happened?
Peter: I just thought that I could work really hard and he could, he would, you know. But I screwed it up.
[Peter sits down on the sofa next to him. May hugs him and strokes him.]
May: Oh... It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay.
Peter: I’m sorry I made you worry.
May: You know I’m not trying to ruin your life.
Peter: Yeah, I know.
May: Just... I used to sneak out too.
Peter: Yeah.
[May scowls, then leans in to sniff Peter’s hair.]
May: And take a shower. You smell. You smell like garbage.
Peter: I know.


[Through a window, we see Peter facing Principal Morita.]
Principal Morita: Peter, you’re a good kid and you’re a smart kid. So just try to keep your head straight, okay?
Peter: Okay.
Principal Morita: All right. Get out of here.
[Peter takes his bag, exits the principal’s office. Ned is waiting for him in the hallway.]
Ned: Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that high school on 46th where the principal has a crossbow?
Peter: Pretty sure that’s an urban myth, and no, I’m not expelled.
Ned: You’re so lucky.
[They walk down the corridor. Tilt up to find a homecoming banner hanging from the ceiling.]


[Peter is resting his head on the desk at detention. He turns to find Michelle holding up a sketch of him with a sad expression.]


[We are now in Spanish class. The clock is ticking. A hand holding a blue pen shoots into frame. It’s Peter.]
Peter: Me gusta hacer la tarea. (I like doing homework.)
Spanish Teacher: Muy bueno, señor Parker. (Very good, Mr. Parker.)


[Peter and Ned finish building the Lego Death Star in the orchestra practice room. Ned hands Peter the Palpatine figure, which Peter places on the top. They do a secret handshake.]


[School bell rings. Peter walks out into an empty hallway and sees Liz.]
Peter: Hey.
Liz: Hey.
Peter: I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Liz: Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.
[Peter approaches Liz.]
Peter: Hey, look, I, uh... I just wanted to apologize about the whole Decathlon thing. I really-
Liz: It’s fine. Last week, Decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died.
Peter: No, I, I just mean that... it was not cool, especially... (sighs) ...because... I like you.
Liz: I know.
[Peter stares at her, shocked.]
Peter: You do?
Liz: You’re terrible at keeping secrets.
Peter: (smiles) Yeah, you’d be surprised.
[An awkward moment. They look at each other.]
Peter: I got to get to class, but, um, I’d say we should hang out, but I’m gonna be in detention for...
Liz: Uh-huh.
Peter: ...ever, but, um, I guess you already have a date to homecoming.
Liz: Actually, I was so busy planning it I never really got around to that part, so...
[Liz shakes her head.]
Peter: Uh, do you want to go with me?
Liz: (smiles) Yeah. Sure.
Peter: Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.
Liz: Cool.
Peter: I’m actually going that way.
[Carrying the hall pass, Peter walks past Liz. We see her turning to watch him go in the background. A huge grin breaks across Peter’s face.]


[In his apartment, Peter slides into the kitchen with a frenzied look.]
Peter: May, I need your help.
[May stares at him with a surprised expression. Peter picks out a dress shirt and tie, polishes his shoes, shakes his head in front of a mirror. May prepares a pink ribbon corsage for him. Peter sprays a perfume in the air to test it, then grimaces at the scent. May and Peter watch a YouTube video on how to tie a Windsor knot. Peter turns to May with a surprisingly passable Windsor knot; overlooking his lopsided shirt collar, that is.]
May: Right?
[Peter is now fully dressed in a suit. May teaches him how to dance, then straightens his clothes.]


[May’s car comes to a stop in front of Liz’s house.]
May: It’s game day. So, what’s the plan?
Peter: Open the door for her.
May: Mm-hmm.
Peter: Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that’s creepy.
May: Don’t be creepy.
Peter: No. And, uh, when I dance with her, I’m putting my hands on her hips. I got this.
[Peter gets out of the car and leans into the car window.]
Peter: Love you.
May: Bye.
[Peter walks up to the front door, pink corsage in hand, then rings the doorbell. He waits with a nervous look for the door to open. With Toomes on the other side. Peter’s smile fades and he freezes. Toomes grins at him.]
Toomes: You must be Peter.
Peter: Yeah.
Toomes: I’m Liz’s dad. Put her there.
[They shake hands.]
Toomes: Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on.
[Toomes drags Peter inside and closes the door. Peter follows Toomes towards the kitchen. Suddenly:]
Doris: Hi, Peter. You look very handsome.
Peter: Thank you.
Doris: (whispers) You got his name right?
Toomes: Freddie?
Doris: Peter.
Toomes: Peter, Peter.
[Doris chuckles and shakes her head.]
Doris: I’m gonna go get Liz.
Peter: Okay.
[She walks out, leaving Peter with Toomes. Toomes starts to polish knives.]
Toomes: You all right, Pete?
Peter: Yeah.
Toomes: Because you look pale. You want something to drink? Like a bourbon or a scotch, or something like that?
Peter: I’m not old enough to drink.
Toomes: That’s the right answer.
[Toomes’ eyes widen as he sees his daughter dressed in a beautiful red dress.]
Toomes: Wow.
[Peter turns in order to see Liz.]
Toomes: Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful.
Liz: Please don’t embarrass me, Dad.
Toomes: Doesn’t she, Pete?
[Liz moves to stand next to Peter.]
Peter: Yeah, you look really good.
Toomes: Once again, that’s the right answer.
Liz: Is that a corsage?
[Staring at Toomes, Peter abruptly hands the corsage to Liz.]
Liz: Thanks.
Toomes: Well, hey, I’m your chauffeur, so, uh, let’s get this show on the road.
Doris: No, no, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. Oh, right here. Perfect.
Liz: Mom.
Doris: Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer.
[Peter stands beside Liz.]
Doris: Smile. There you go.
[Liz’s mother takes some more snaps. Peter puts on a tense grin for the photo, his eyes still glued on Toomes.]
Peter: Sir, you don’t have to drive us.
Toomes: No, no, it’s not a big deal. I’m going out of town. It’s right on my way.
[Liz goes to her mother to check the photos.]
Doris: He’s always coming and going.
Toomes: Last time.
Doris: Have fun.
[Doris hugs her daughter.]
Liz: Thank you.
Toomes: Promise.
Doris: (whispers) He’s cute.
Liz: Shh.
Toomes: See you in a couple of days.
Doris: Bye, baby.
Toomes: All right.
[Doris and Adrian Toomes kiss each other.]
Toomes: Come on, Pedro.
Doris: Bye, Peter. Have fun.
Peter: Yeah, I will.


[Toomes is driving. Liz looks at herself through her phone camera, wearing the corsage Peter gave her, while Peter stares out the window.]
Toomes: What are you gonna do, Pete?
Peter: What?
Toomes: When you graduate, what do you think you’re gonna do?
Peter: Oh, um, I don’t know.
Liz: Don’t grill him, Dad.
Toomes: Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school, you pretty much have your life planned out, right?
Peter: Yeah, no, I’m just a sophomore.
Liz: Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. So I think he doesn’t have to worry.
Toomes: Really?
Liz: Mm-hmm.
Toomes: Stark?
Liz: So cool.
Toomes: What do you do?
Peter: Yeah, actually, I don’t intern for him anymore.
[Liz turns to Peter, frowning.]
Liz: Seriously?
Peter: Yeah, it got, um... boring.
Liz: It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.
Toomes: Really? Spider-Man? Wow. What’s he like?
Peter: Yeah, he’s nice. Nice man. Solid dude.
Toomes: Hmm.
[Liz shows Peter her phone.]
Liz: Look, so cute.
Peter: Aww...
[Toomes keeps stealing glances at Peter.]
Toomes: I’ve seen you around, right? I mean... Somewhere. We’ve, uh, have we ever? Because even the voice...
Liz: Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me.
Toomes: Oh.
Liz: And he was at my party.
Toomes: Ah.
Peter: It was a great party, really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
[Peter and Liz smile at each other.]
Liz: You were there for, like, two seconds.
Peter: That was... I was there longer than two seconds.
Liz: You disappeared.
Peter: No, no. I did not disappear.
Liz: Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do. Like you did in D.C., too.
[Toomes glances at Peter suspiciously. He stops at an intersection.]
Toomes: That’s terrible, what happened down there in D.C., though. Were you scared?
[Peter nods tersely.]
Toomes: I’ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator, though, huh?
[Peter glances at Liz, then:]
Peter: Yeah, well, I actually didn’t go up. I saw it all from the ground.
Liz: Yeah.
[Toomes stares at Peter through the rearview mirror.]
Peter: Very lucky that he was there that day.
Toomes: (grins) Good old Spider-Man.
[The traffic light turns green. Car honks blare behind them.]
Liz: Dad, the light.
[Toomes continues driving and arrives at Midtown High. Outside, well-dressed teenagers are walking to the entrance decorated with colorful balloons.]
Toomes: Here we are. End of the line.
Liz: Thanks, Dad.
Toomes: You head in there, gumdrop. I’m gonna give Peter the, uh, the “dad talk.”
Liz: (to Peter) Don’t let him intimidate you.
[Liz kisses her dad on the cheek.]
Liz: Love you.
Toomes: Love you, gumdrop.
Liz: Have a safe flight.
[Liz gets out of the car and joins her friends.]
Liz: Hi! You guys look so pretty.
[Toomes turns to Peter with a gun.]
Toomes: Does she know?
Peter: Know what?
Toomes: So she doesn’t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I’ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn’t want my daughter to date...
[Toomes cracks a grin and shrugs, but Peter does not say anything.]
Toomes: Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter’s life. I could never forget something like that. So I’m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened. And don’t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. Because if you do, I’ll kill you and everybody you love. I’ll kill you dead. That’s what I’ll do to protect my family. Do you understand?
[Peter nods, unable to meet Toomes’ eyes.]
Toomes: Hey. I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?
[Peter raises his head and looks straight at Toomes.]
Peter: Thank you.
Toomes: You’re welcome. Now, you go in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good.
[Peter gets out of the car with a tense expression on his face. Toomes drives off. Peter enters the school.]
[Peter walks down the hallway, all sounds muffled as if underwater. He stops and watches his friends through the glass doors. Party in full swing. Spotting him, Ned waves and Michelle gives Peter the finger. A beat, then Peter pulls open the door. Pop music and chattering instantly fills Peter’s ears. Liz is dancing with some of her friends. She turns to Peter when he approaches.]
Liz: Hey. What did he say to you?
[Peter just stares at Liz with an anxious look. Liz realizes that something is off.]
Peter: Gotta go. I’m, I’m sorry. You don’t deserve this.
[Peter hurries away, leaving Liz in the middle of the dance floor. Michelle watches him go, craning her neck.]
[Peter rushes out through the hallway and unties his tie. He lifts a row of lockers with one hand, picks up his homemade Spider-Man suit from under it.]


[Now clad in his homemade Spider-Man suit, Peter exits the school. As he is about to round a school bus, someone shocks him from behind.]
Schultz: He gave you a choice. You chose wrong.
Peter: Ah, what the hell?
Schultz: What’s with the crappy costume?
[The Shocker prepares his gauntlet for another shot. Peter searches for his web-shooter, which has fallen from the impact and is lying on the ground.]
Peter: My web-shooters...
[Peter runs to the web-shooter, but Schultz hits a school bus to attack Peter, then kicks the web-shooter away.]
Schultz: I wasn’t sure about this thing at first, but damn.
[Schultz hits Peter with the weapon, throwing him inside the bus. Peter spots chewed gums under a seat.]
Peter: Ugh. Gross.
[Schultz punches the bus into the air. Peter tumbles as the vehicle lands upside down on the ground. Opening the door, Peter falls out. He slowly crawls to his web-shooter.]
Peter: Why did he send you here?
Schultz: Guess you’ll never know.
[Suddenly, a strand of web attaches itself to the Shocker gauntlet. Reveal Ned holding the web-shooter.]
Peter: Nice shot!
[Peter pulls the web-shooter to himself and traps Schultz against the school bus with a web blast.]
Peter: Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz’s dad.
Ned: What?
Peter: I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He’s Mr. Stark’s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me.
Ned: Are you gonna be okay?
[Peter jumps up onto a streetlight.]
Peter: Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town.
[Ned hurries toward the school building as Peter swings away.]


[Flash is driving his annoyed date to the homecoming dance.]
Flash: I’m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino’s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So...
[Flash screams as Peter lands on the bonnet of his car.]
Peter: (in a gravelly voice) Flash, I need your car and your phone.
Flash: Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad’s car, sir. So I can’t...
[Flash watches the Spider-Man drive away in his car and hit a row of bikes. He whimpers.]


[Peter makes a call to Ned while driving precariously. Ned takes it in the library, between rows of computers.]
Peter: (in a normal voice) Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?
Ned: Go for Ned.
Peter: Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.
Ned: Yeah, but where is it?
[Peter's phone lights up in the backseat of Toomes’ car. Toomes is unaware. Ned tracks the signal.]
Ned: Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Peter: Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I’m in Flash’s car.
[Ned rolls his chair to another computer.]
Ned: I’ll pull the specs.
Peter: Okay, you’re on speakerphone.
Ned: You stole Flash’s car. Awesome.
Peter: Yeah, it’s awesome. It’s awe... Whoa!
[Peter nearly crashes into other cars.]
Peter: Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!
Ned: Peter, are you okay?
Peter: I’ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up...
[A car nearly hits Peter, who screams.]
Peter: Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?
Ned: Yeah. I’m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
[Ned rapidly types, then twirls in his chair.]
Ned: Guy in the chair.


[Toomes checks his watch and heads to an old Brooklyn factory warehouse.]


[Happy pops up on Ned’s computer screen.]
Happy: Takeoff in nine minutes. (to Ned) Hello? Hello? Who is this?
Ned: Uh... Mr. Happy, it’s Ned.
Happy: Who?
Ned: I’m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-
Happy: You gotta be shitting me.
[Happy’s screen goes off.]
Ned: Damn.


Peter: Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?
Ned: Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Peter: Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where’s my phone now?
Ned: Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.
Peter: What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!
[The car is a literal hazard as it drives down the road.]
Ned: Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don’t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes.
Peter: What?
Ned: He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.
Peter: Boxes? It’s moving day. It’s moving day! It’s moving day! He’s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!


[Inside Avengers Tower, Happy is talking on the phone, checking Tony’s belongings.]
Happy: All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony’s old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap’s new shield, and the Meging... the Meg... the... Thor’s magic belt.


[Peter drives down an empty road at a high speed.]
Ned: Okay, slow down. You’re getting close. It’s on your right.
Peter: What?
Ned: Turn right! Turn right!
[Peter shoots his web to make a sharp turn. The car crashes into a streetlight and is almost overturned. It slides down the road on its side, then finally screeches to a stop.]
Ned: Peter, are you okay?
Peter: Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
[Peter jumps out of the car.]


Ned: It’s been an honor, Spider-Man.
[Suddenly, the lights come on. Reveal Ms. Warren standing behind Ned.]
Ms. Warren: What are you doing here? There’s a dance.
Ned: Uh...
[Ned hurriedly closes his laptop.]
Ned: (awkwardly) I’m... looking... at... porn.


[We see a small window in the ceiling open. Peter hangs from his web and slowly descends into the building. The room is filled with computers and gadgets. Monitors showing Avengers Tower and the blueprint of Stark’s plane. Peter spots Vulture’s wing suit and goes deeper inside.]
Peter: Hey! Surprised?
Toomes: Oh, hey, Pete. I didn’t hear you come in.
Peter: It’s over. I’ve got you.
Toomes: You know, I gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn’t sure. I thought, “Really?” But I get it now.
Peter: How could you do this to her?
Toomes: To her? I’m not doing anything to her, Pete. I’m doing this for her.
Peter: Huh, yeah.
[Peter shoots his web and glues Vulture’s left hand against the desk.]
Toomes: (sighs) Peter, you’re young. You don’t understand how the world works.
Peter: Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.
Toomes: How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don’t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don’t care about us. We have to pick up after ‘em. We have to eat their table scraps. That’s how it is. I know you know what I’m talking about, Peter.
Peter: Why are you telling me this?
Toomes: Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.
[Vulture takes a folding knife out of his pocket. Vulture’s wing suit flies out from behind Peter’s back, which he avoids. In the confusion of the moment, Vulture cuts free from the web. The wing suit continues to attack Peter, but he avoids it with quick movements.]
Toomes: I’m sorry, Peter.
Peter: What are you talking about? That thing hasn’t even touched me yet.
Toomes: True. Then again, wasn’t really trying to.
[Peter realizes that the wing suit wasn’t attacking him; instead, it was chopping down the pillars. The building collapses, its wreckage raining down on Peter and burying him. Vulture picks up a walkie-talkie.]
Mason: Chief, they’re powering up engines.
Toomes: Okay.
Mason: Come on, come on, come on.
Toomes: Yeah, yeah.
[Vulture takes one last look of the pile of debris covering Peter, then walks away. He pauses to stare at the Avengers Tower. His wing suit attaches itself on his back.]


[The plane is about to take off from the Avengers Tower. Happy walks away from it.]


[We hear grunts and cries. Reveal Peter under the debris, still alive. He panics and takes off his mask.]
Peter: Oh, god. Okay, ready?
[He struggles to get up but fails.]
Peter: Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I’m down here. I’m down here. I’m stuck. I’m stuck. I can’t move. I can’t...
[Peter takes a moment to catch his breath and looks down at his reflection on a puddle. The Spider-Man mask in the puddle covers half the reflection, making it look as if Peter is wearing the Spider-Man mask on half his face.]
Tony: If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it.
[Once again, Peter tries to push the debris off his back.]
Peter: Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man!
[Peter finally frees himself from the debris and gets up amongst rubbles. He spots Vulture perching on top of a stripped billboard.]


[The plane takes off from Avengers Tower.]


[Mason is sitting in a control room.]
Mason: Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.
Toomes: Oh, yeah.
[Vulture spreads his wings and prepares for takeoff. Peter shoots his web and swings onto the billboard, but narrowly misses Vulture, who flies away. Spider-Man shoots his web directly at Vulture.]
Tech: Retro-reflective panels engaged.
[The outer panels of the plane light up and mirror the New York City. Vulture goes after the plane.]
Toomes: Got a visual on the plane, feeling a little resistance.
Mason: It’s probably just a drag on the new turbines.
[Vulture checks behind him but misses Spider-Man, who is hanging from a web attached to his back.]
Peter: Ah! Whoa!
[As Vulture goes higher and higher up, the night view of New York City gets smaller and smaller under Peter’s feet.]
Mason: Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.
[Vulture flies to the bottom of the plane and holds on. Peter bumps into the plane a few times, but manages to grab onto it.]
Peter: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Mason: Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.
Toomes: This better work, Mason.
[The wing suit wraps around Vulture like a shell.]
Mason: Trust me, boss. Even one of those boxes and we are set for life.
Toomes: Yeah.
[Vulture puts the matter phase shifter on the plane, creating a small rectangular window, and moves inside. Peter tries to follow Vulture, but loses his grip and almost falls off the plane.]
Peter: Hey! Ah! Whew.
Mason: You have thirty seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security.
[Vulture walks to the front and rips out the door. The cockpit is empty. Outside, we see a blown-up image of Spider-Man crawling down the plane. He must have been caught the cloaking cameras. He approaches the wing suit and tries to open it. Vulture connects a device to the plane.]
Toomes: Cloning transponder signal.
Mason: Launching decoy drone.
[A small drone is launched out from the wing suit, startling Peter.]
Toomes: Entering new coordinates.
[Vulture manipulates the cockpit dashboard, piloting the plane off track.]


[A computer monitor displays the flight course in Avengers Tower.]
Happy: Good, so it’s on its way?
Tech: Yes, sir, right on course.
Happy: Okay, thank you. All right.
[The tech takes the laptop and leaves the almost-empty room.]


[Peter is still struggling to open the wing suit. Inside the plane, Vulture finds the boxes and takes off his mask.]
Toomes: Hot dog.
[Vulture opens one box after another. Rows and rows of Chitauri guns, arc reactors, etc. He takes out an Iron Man mask and throws it on the floor. Peter kicks Vulture’s wing suit and pushes it aside a bit. The air pressure inside the cabin drops, activating the alarm. Vulture checks an external monitor and realizes that Peter has followed him. He growls in anger.]
[Vulture comes out and puts on his wing suit. Peter tries to hang onto the airplane.]
Peter: Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... Fighting my girlfriend’s dad.
[Vulture comes at him and takes out panels right above his head. Peter shoots his web at Vulture. Peter is now suspended in air, one hand holding onto the web sticking to the plane, another hand holding onto the web glued to Vulture. The webs snap off and Peter is sucked in towards the engines.]
Peter: Oh, god!
[He shoots his web to stop the propellers. Vulture, who was also dragged to the engines, escapes death, but his wing suit is a bit damaged. Hanging onto propeller blades laced with spiderweb, Peter sighs in relief.]
Peter: Whew. I can’t believe that worked.
[Suddenly, the propeller falls off. Peter avoids the crisis by holding onto the plane and kicking the propeller off his body. Vulture flies back and attacks Peter. Peter avoids them, but Vulture keeps coming at him. The impact sets one of the engines on fire. Peter clings onto the side of the engine with a thin strand of web.]
Mason: Chief, chief, they’re losing altitude. Get out of there.
Toomes: I’m not going home empty-handed.
[Vulture sets to break open the ceiling of the plane. Still hanging from the engine, Peter sees the plane flying straight at the city.]
Peter: Oh, my god.
[Peter shoots his web at the right wing of the plane and pulls on it to change the plane’s direction. On the streets, passersby watch the plane flying overhead. Vulture tears open the ceiling and holds a box in his claws.]
Mason: Get out of there! What are you doing?
[Peter continues to struggle with the plane.]
Peter: Please turn! Please turn!
[The plane narrowly misses crashing into the city and heads toward Coney Island. Instead of escaping, Vulture tries to hold onto a box.]


[Happy, sitting comfortably in a chair, jumps up. He looks out and sees Tony’s plane flying straight at Coney Island.]


[The plane hits a ride and crash-lands on the beach of Coney Island. Peter loses hold of the plane and rolls down the beach. Everything is consumed in smoke and flames. Peter slowly gets up and takes off his mask. His ears are ringing. He has just staggered up to his feet when, suddenly, Vulture flies toward him and attacks him. Sparks fly from Vulture’s wings; it is clear that he has suffered some serious damage, too.]
Toomes: Hey, Pedro.
[Vulture continues to attack Peter. Peter shoots his web, but misses and gets pinned to the ground like a bird of prey. He screams as Vulture grabs him tightly with his claws and rains down punches at him. When Peter grabs Vulture’s fist to prevent another blow, Vulture flies up and lets go of him. Peter avoids serious injury by shooting a strand of web and holding on to Vulture, but Vulture cuts it off and throws him to the ground. He then slams Peter into the ground a few times. Peter flips onto his back in a sluggish way, then looks up at Vulture, who picks him up by the hood of his Spider-Man costume. Vulture is holding Peter there, studying his limp body, when he spots a crate.]
Toomes: Bingo.
[Vulture lets go of Peter, takes his goggles off, and grabs the crateful of arc reactors. Sparks rain down from his wing suit when he tries to lift the crate, but Vulture does not stop.]
Peter: Your wing suit. Your wing suit’s gonna explode!
[Lifting his weary arm, Peter shoots a strand of web at the crate and pulls with all his might. A tug of war ensues.]
Toomes: Time to go home, Pete.
Peter: I’m trying to save you!
[Vulture cuts the web with his wing and tries to fly off. Peter presses the button on his web shooter, but it doesn’t work. He looks up to see the wing suit failing and covers his head. Vulture drops to the ground along with his wing suit. An explosion consumes him.]
Peter: No.
[Peter struggles up and runs into the flames. He spots Toomes and tries to lift the wing suit off him, but screams as he makes contact with hot metal. However, he doesn’t give up. He picks the wing suit up, finds Toomes, and carries him away from the flames. Peter lays Toomes down on the beach. Wheezing and coughing from the smoke, Toomes looks up at Peter, who returns his gaze.]


[The flames have died out a little. A search party is scouring the beach. Happy finds Vulture tied to a pile of crates with spiderweb. A note is attached beside him: “FOUND FLYING VULTURE GUY. SPIDER-MAN. P.S. SORRY ABOUT YOUR PLANE.” Happy raises his head and looks around as if searching for someone.]
[Fire engines pass by the Cyclone. Peter is sitting on top of it. He closes his eyes, wounded and weary.]


[Midtown High. Students are taking down a homecoming banner. Below it, Ned and Peter walk down the corridor.]
Ned: It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He, he was just like, “Zzzz,” and you were like, “Ah!”
Peter: Shh.
Ned: And then I just hit him with the “pew.” It was so, oh, my god.
Peter: You saved me. It was awesome.
[Peter spots Liz at the end of the corridor. Her mom is walking beside her with a box full of her belongings. Betty runs to Liz and hugs her. Peter runs toward them.]
Peter: Hey, Liz!
Betty: I’m gonna miss you.
Liz: Bye.
Peter: Liz.
[Liz waits for Peter, wiping tears off her face.]
Peter: Liz, look. I’m so sorry.
Liz: You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?
[When Peter fails to answer:]
Liz: The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Peter: Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your dad... I can’t imagine what you’re going through. If there’s anything I can do to help...
Liz: (fighting tears) I guess we’re moving to Oregon. Mom says it’s nice there, so that’s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn’t want us here during the trial, so...
Peter: Liz, I... I...
Liz: Bye, Peter. Whatever’s going on with you, I hope you figure it out.
[Liz leaves the school with her mother. Peter watches her go.]


[In the library, Mr. Harrington brings the Decathlon trophy to a table of students.]
Mr. Harrington: Congratulations, Decathlon national champions.
Decathlon Team: (clapping) Yeah!
Mr. Harrington: I’m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I’m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I’m appointing Michelle.
[The students turn to Michelle and clap.]
Decathlon Team: Yeah!
Michelle: Uh, thank you. My friends call me M.J.
Ned: I thought you didn’t have any friends.
Michelle: I didn’t.
[Peter’s cell phone vibrates. He picks the broken phone up and reads a message from an unknown number: “Go to the bathroom.”]
Peter: I... I gotta go.
Michelle: Hey, where you going?
[Peter freezes as he thinks of an excuse. Michelle stares at him, eyes filled with suspicion.]
Michelle: What are you hiding, Peter?
[Peter’s lips open, but no sound comes out. Suddenly, a grin breaks out on Michelle’s face.]
Michelle: I’m just kidding. I don’t care. Bye. (to Decathlon team) All right, so we should run some drills.
Ned: Yeah.
[Michelle watches with curious eyes as Peter stands to leave.]


[Peter rounds the corner and finds Happy waiting for him in the bathroom.]
Peter: Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?
Happy: I really owe you one. I don’t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-
[A toilet flushes and cuts him off. They awkwardly stand there as Tiny McKeever comes out, washes his hands, wipes them, and leaves the bathroom, throwing a long, confused glance at them. Finally:]
Peter: So, uh, how long you been here?
Happy: Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.
Peter: (whispers) Is he here too?
Happy: In the toilet? No, he’s upstate.
Peter: Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?
Happy: Yeah, let’s go.


[Inside Happy's car. Dashboard display says: “You may take your hands off the steering wheel.”]
Happy: Take a look. It’s pretty impressive, huh?
[Outside the window, we see the New Avengers Facility.]
Happy: They just finished remodeling the whole thing.
[Peter studies the facility with an awed expression. We see the reflection of a Quinjet taking off.]


[Inside the compound, Peter watches a Quinjet fly off with a huge grin.]
Happy: You don’t see that every day.
[Tony approaches them.]
Tony: Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?
Happy: Good.
Tony: Give me a minute with the kid.
Happy: Seriously?
Tony: Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.
Happy: I’ll be close behind.
Tony: How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.
[Tony playfully punches Peter in the shoulder, then puts an arm around him.]
Tony: Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn’t you think? Don’t you think?
Peter: Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Tony: Let’s just say it was.
[Tony sighs and continues leading Peter towards a door.]
Peter: Mr. Stark, I really-
Tony: You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.
Peter: To the... To the team?
Tony: Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There’s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
[He presses some buttons on his watch and a secret compartment in the wall opens, revealing a brand new Spider-Man suit, the Iron Spider Armor.]
Tony: When you’re ready... Why don’t you try that on? And I’ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.
Peter: I...
[Peter chuckles, amazed.]
Tony: Yeah. Give that a look.
[Peter continues to admire the Iron Spider Armor.]
Tony: So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where’s he between? He’s next to Vision?
Happy: Yeah, Vision’s not big on doors.
Tony: It’s fun.
Happy: Or walls.
Tony: (to Peter) You’ll fit right in.
[Peter hesitates for a moment, then turns to Tony.]
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I’m good.
Tony: You’re good? Good? How are you good?
Peter: Well, I mean, I’m... I’d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody’s got to look out for the little guy, right?
[Tony takes off his sunglasses and stares into Peter’s eyes.]
Tony: You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?
Peter: No.
Tony: Okay. It’s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?
Happy: Yeah. (to Peter) Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Tony: Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well.
[Tony and Peter shake hands.]
Peter: See you around.
Tony: Okay.
[Peter starts to leave with a spring in his step, but then slows to a stop and turns to Tony, who is putting the Iron Spider Armor away with a tap on his watch.]
Peter: That was a test, right? There’s, uh, nobody back there?
Tony: Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.
Tony: Yeah, thank you.
[Peter walks away.]
Happy: Told you he’s a good kid.
[Tony shrugs. A door behind him opens, revealing a room full of reporters. We can hear their excited murmurs. Pepper comes out with a somewhat frenzied, annoyed look when she realizes that Peter is not there.]
Pepper: Where’s the kid?
Happy: He left.
Pepper: Everybody’s waiting.
Tony: You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.
Pepper: Did you guys screw this up?
Tony: (points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.
Pepper: Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?
Tony: Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?
Happy: Do I... I, uh...
[Happy makes a show of patting his pockets to find the ring.]
Tony: The engagement ring?
Happy: Are you kidding? I’ve been carrying this since 2008.
[He holds up the engagement ring. Beat, then:]
Tony: Okay.
Pepper: I think I can think of something better than that.
Tony: Well, it would buy us a little time.
[Pepper kisses Tony with a smile on her lips.]
Tony: Like we need time.
Pepper: I can’t believe you have that thing in your pocket.
[She starts to walk back towards the conference room.]
Tony: Want me to get the door for you, hon?
Pepper: I got it.
[Tony quickly follows her, catching the ring that Happy throws to him.]


[Peter walks out of the facility. A smile blossoms on his face.]


Peter: Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
[Peter enters his apartment and throws his keys on a table. He stops when he finds a brown paper bag that says “This belongs to you. -TS” sitting on his bed. Taking out his earphones, Peter calls out:]
Peter: May?
[No answer. Peter gets into his Spider-Man suit, then pulls off the mask. Reveal May standing in the doorway behind him.]
May: What the fu...?


[Prison. Toomes walks through a cell block. Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, approaches.]
Gargan: Look who it is! What are the odds you and I’d end up in the same summer camp? Relax. This? (points at the scar on his forehead) It’s not on you. It’s on our, uh... little spider friend. I’ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... you know who he is.
[Toomes smiles almost imperceptibly.]
Toomes: If I knew who he was, he’d already be dead.
[Gargan stares at him with one eye severely bloodshot.]
Guard: Toomes, your family’s here.
[Toomes walks away, smiling.]


An empty white screen. Captain America enters frame in his uniform.
Steve: Hi. I’m Captain America. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little. It seems like it’s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.
[He uncomfortably glares at someone off-screen.]
Steve: How many more of these?
[Cut to black.]

 The Incredible Hulk

     
Tony Stark: I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
Soldier: We can talk, sir.
Tony Stark: Oh, I see. So it's personal?
Soldier (female): [She's driving the Vehicle.] No, you intimidate them.
Tony Stark: Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
Soldier (female): I'm an airman.
Tony Stark: Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? [The Soldiers in the vehicle laugh and chuckle.] Come on, it's okay, laugh.
Soldier: Sir, I have a question to ask.
Tony Stark: Yes, please.
Soldier: Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
Tony Stark: That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? [The Soldier next to him, Jimmy, raises his hand.] You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Soldier (Jimmy): Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Tony Stark: Yes. It's very cool. [The soldier next to him pulls his camera out and hands it to the soldier in the front seat.] I don't want to see this on your MySpace page. [The Soldier puts up a peace sign for the photo.] Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
Soldier (Jimmy): Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. Just click it.
[As the picture was about to be taken, something hit and blew up the vehicle in front of them. Gunshots and such were heard and hitting the side of their vehicle.]
Tony Stark: What's going on?
Soldier (female): Contact left!
Tony Stark: What have we got?
[The driver stepped out to go into combat and was shot down]
Soldier: Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Soldier (Jimmy): Stay down!
Tony Stark: Yeah.
[The other Soldier from the front seat got out to shoot but was shot too]
Soldier (Jimmy): Son of a bitch!
[Jimmy goes out to fight.]
Tony Stark: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
Soldier (Jimmy): Stay here!
[Jimmy turned back around and he was gunned down too, holes piercing the vehicle. Tony's hearing and senses were dulled a bit as he got himself out of the vehicle, stumbling a bit in the chaos. He got some of his hearing back and ran and dove behind a rock for cover. He pulled out his phone to contact and call for help when a bomb landed next to him. He looked over to see it say: Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn't in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.]
Tony Stark: Whoa!
[He hit the ground hard, senses dulled again. He felt a pain in his chest and pulled his shirt of out the way as blood started to pool.]


Voice over: Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.
James Rhodes: As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony?
Obadiah Stane: Thank you, Colonel.
James Rhodes: Thanks for the save.
Obadiah Stane: This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working.


Tony Stark: Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.
James Rhodes: You are unbelievable.
Tony Stark: Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
James Rhodes: Nobody roped me into anything!
Tony Stark: I'm so sorry.
James Rhodes: But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.
Tony Stark: Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?
James Rhodes: It's right here. Here you go.
Tony Stark: There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's okay.
Tony Stark: Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. [hot girl blows on dice] Okay, you, too. [Tony holds the dice out to Rhodes.]
James Rhodes: I don't blow on a man's dice.
Tony Stark: Come on, honey bear.
James Rhodes: I don't blow on a man's dice. [Rhodes knocks Tony's hand away causing the dice to roll]
Tony Stark: There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Dealer: Two craps. Line away.
James Rhodes: That's what happens.
Tony Stark: Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?
[Tony, Rhodes, and Happy leaving the casino.]
James Rhodes: This is where I exit.
Tony Stark: All right.
James Rhodes: Tomorrow, don't be late.
Tony Stark: Yeah, you can count on it.
James Rhodes: I'm serious!
Tony Stark: I know, I know. [Handing over his award to Caesar.] Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go.
[Outside of the casino.]
Christine Everhart: Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?
Happy Hogan: [whispering to Tony] She's cute. 
Tony Stark: She's all right? [Turns to face Christine.] Hi.
Christine Everhart: Hi.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay-- 
Christine Everhart: It's okay? 
Tony Stark: Go.
Christine Everhart: You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
Christine Everhart: And what do you say to your other nickname? ""The Merchant of Death""?
Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?
Christine Everhart: Brown, actually.
Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
Christine Everhart: You rehearse that much?
Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
Christine Everhart: I can see that.
Tony Stark: I'd like to show you first-hand.
Christine Everhart: All I want is a serious answer.
Tony Stark: Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.""
Christine Everhart: That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.
Tony Stark: My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
Christine Everhart: And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.
Tony Stark: Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
Christine Everhart: You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
Tony Stark: I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
[They go to Malibu and have sex.]
JARVIS: Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
Christine Everhart: [Walking around Tony's mansion.] Tony? Hey, Tony? [Tries to play with the controls on the wall. It beeps at her.]
JARVIS: You are not authorized to access this area.
Christine Everhart: Jesus.
Pepper Potts: That's JARVIS. He runs the house. I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.
Christine Everhart: You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
Pepper Potts: Indeed I am.
Christine Everhart: After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.
Pepper Potts: I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?


[Tony working on a car in his workshop]
Tony Stark: Give me an exploded view. 
JARVIS: The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.
Tony Stark: Log that.
Pepper Potts: [Coming in on her phone.] I'm gonna try again, right now.
Tony Stark: Please don't turn down my music.
Pepper Potts: I'll keep you posted. [Getting off the phone.] You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.
Tony Stark: How'd she take it?
Pepper Potts: Like a champ.
Tony Stark: Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
Pepper Potts: Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
Tony Stark: That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.
Pepper Potts: Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.
Tony Stark: I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
Pepper Potts: Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.
Tony Stark: Is it a good representation of his spring period?
Pepper Potts: Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked-- 
Tony Stark: So?
Pepper Potts: --not ""spring"" like the season. I think it's a fair example. Um.. I think it's incredibly overpriced.
Tony Stark: I need it. Buy it. Store it.
Pepper Potts: Okay. The MIT commencement speech...
Tony Stark: Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...
Pepper Potts: Well, they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.
Tony Stark: Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
Pepper Potts: I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
Tony Stark: What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?
Pepper Potts: As a matter of fact, I do.
Tony Stark: I don't like it when you have plans.
Pepper Potts: I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
Tony Stark: It's your birthday?
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Tony Stark: I knew that. Already?
Pepper Potts: Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
Tony Stark: Well, get yourself something nice from me.
Pepper Potts: I already did.
Tony Stark: And?
Pepper Potts: Oh, it was very nice.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.


[Happy and Tony racing to the airport and arriving.]
Tony Stark: You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
Happy: You did, sir. [Grabbing Tony's things from the trunk.] I had to cut across Mulholland.
Tony Stark: I got you. I got you.
James Rhodes: What's wrong with you? [Standing at the jet doorway.]
Tony Stark: What?
James Rhodes: Three hours.
Tony Stark: I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
James Rhodes: For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.
Tony Stark: Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll! 


[inside the jet.]
Tony Stark: What you reading, platypus?
James Rhodes: Nothing.
Tony Stark: Come on, sour patch. 
James Rhodes: I'm not sour.
Tony Stark: Don't be mad.
James Rhodes: I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?
Tony Stark: I said I was sorry.
Flight Attendant #1: Good morning, Mr. Stark.
James Rhodes: You don't need to apologize to me. 
Tony Stark: I told you I was sorry.
James Rhodes: I'm your man.
Tony Stark: Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...
James Rhodes: I'm just indifferent right now. 
Flight Attendant #1: Hot towel?
James Rhodes: You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.
Tony Stark: I respect you.
James Rhodes: I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed... [grabs a hot towel] Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?
Tony Stark: Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.
James Rhodes: No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now.
Tony Stark: You can't have sashimi without sake.
James Rhodes: You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.
Tony Stark: It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
Flight Attendant #2: Hot sake?
Tony Stark: Yes, two, please.
James Rhodes: No. Just-- I'm not drinking. I don't want any.


[Rhodes and Tony drunk on the couch and the flight attendants dancing around them.]
James Rhodes: That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!
Tony Stark: Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...
James Rhodes: No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are.
Tony Stark: Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
James Rhodes: No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!


[Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan.]
Tony Stark: General.
General: Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.
Tony Stark: Thanks.


[Tony giving his presentation in the desert of Afghanistan.]
Tony Stark: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves. [The missiles get launched.] For your consideration, the Jericho. [The missiles explode]


Tony Stark: [Opening a cooler full of alcohol]I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace! [Tony's phone begins ringing.]
Obadiah Stane: [through the video chat] Tony.
Tony Stark: Obie, what are you doing up?
Obadiah Stane: I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?
Tony Stark: It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Obadiah Stane: Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Tony Stark: Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
Obadiah Stane: Good night, Tony. [Tony hangs up the call as he enters the military vehicle.]
James Rhodes: Hey, Tony. [Coming up to the vehicle Tony's in.]
Tony Stark:  I'm sorry, this is the ""fun-vee."" The ""hum-drum-vee"" is back there.
James Rhodes: Nice job.
Tony Stark: See you back at base.


[Replay of the attack in the first scene mixed with Tony have surgery and screaming. Tony wakes up suddenly with a tube up his nose, laying on a cot in a cave. He rips out the tube and tries to pick up a cup on the table beside him, but fails. He notices a man shaving and tries to reach further but is stopped by wires.]
Yinsen: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[Tony realizes that he's connected to a battery. He rips off the bandages over his chest to see an electromagnet inside his chest]


[Yinsen and Tony sitting by a small fire. Yinsen is making food while Tony is using a mirror to look at his chest.]
Tony Stark: What the hell did you do to me?
Yinsen: What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? [Pulls out a bottle of shrapnel.] I have a souvenir. Take a look. [Tosses the bottle to Tony] I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.
Tony Stark: What is this?
Yinsen: That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm? [Tony sips up the jacket he's wearing and looks at the camera on the ceiling.] That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.
Tony Stark: I don't remember.
Yinsen: No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.
Tony Stark: Where are we?
[Loud voices sound from the another side of the metal door as they open it.]
Yinsen: Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up. 
[Men walk in with guns.]
Tony Stark: Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
Yinsen: Do you understand me? Do as I do. [A man starts speaking in Arabic. Yinsen translates for him.] He says, ""Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer ""in the history of America."" [Man speaks in Arabic.] He is honored. [Man speaks in Arabic.] He wants you to build the missile. [Man speaks in Arabic.] The Jericho missile that you demonstrated. [Man speaks in Arabic, handing Yinsen a picture of the Jericho missile.] This one.
Tony Stark:  I refuse. [Tony then is shown with his head in a large thing of water. Flashes of himself and the electromagnet in his chest are shown.]
Pepper Potts: Tony! [As a voice in his head as he tries not to drown.]
[The men pull him out, put a bag over his head, and escort him out of the cave. Tony sees a lot of men, tents, and his guns. The same man speaking Arabic before speaks again.]
Yinsen: He wants to know what you think.
Tony Stark: I think you got a lot of my weapons. 
[Yinsen translates Tony's words into Arabic. The same man speaking Arabic responds]
Yinsen: He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. [Man speaks Arabic again] He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.
Tony Stark: No, he won't. [Shaking the Arabic man's hand.]
Yinsen: No, he won't.


Yinsen: [Tony sitting around a small fire in the cave with Tony] I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?
Tony Stark: Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
Yinsen: Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? Hm?
Tony Stark: [Directing the men to where to put things while Yinsen's translating] If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools. [Yinsen and Tony start taking apart the weapons.] How many languages do you speak?
Yinsen: A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.
Tony Stark: Who are these people?
Yinsen: They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings. [The men of the Ten Rings are shown watching Tony and Yinsen work on a TV.] You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.
Tony Stark: Uh-huh. [Tony pulls apart a missile.] Okay, we don't need this.
Yinsen: What is that?
Tony Stark: That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?  


Man #1: What's he doing? [speaking Arabic]
Man #2: Working. [speaking Arabic]
[Tony and Yinsen working on something. Yinsen is pulling something out of the fire.]
Tony Stark: Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.
Yinsen: Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive?
Tony Stark: What do I call you?
Yinsen: My name is Yinsen.
Tony Stark: Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
Yinsen: Nice to meet you, too. [Tony puts together a device while Yinsen watches.] Whoa. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.
Tony Stark: That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
Yinsen: But what could it generate?
Tony Stark: If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.
Yinsen: That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.


Tony Stark: [Looking at sheets of paper with Tony] This is our ticket out of here.
Yinsen: What is it?
Tony Stark: Flatten them out and look. [Yinsen flattens the sheets out to see a drawing of a metal suit.]
Yinsen: Oh, wow. Impressive.
[Security footage shows that the arc reactor was successfully put in Tony, allowing him more freedom of movement without having to carry the car battery around.]


[Tony and Yinsen playing a game.]
Yinsen: Good. Good roll. Good roll.
Tony Stark: You still haven't told me where you're from.
Yinsen: I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's actually a nice place.
Tony Stark: Got a family?
Yinsen: Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?
Tony Stark: No.
Yinsen: No? So you're a man who has everything and nothing.
[The men of the Ten Rings come to the door, armed. They open the hatch to see Tony and Yinsen working before turning around and leaving. Shows Tony welding metal together, while the Ten Rings watch the cameras and compare what he's creating with the Jericho picture.]
Man #1: It doesn't look anything like the picture. [Speaking Arabic]
Man #2: Maybe it's been modified. [Speaking Arabic]
Man #1: The tail is wrong. [Speaking Arabic]
Man #2: It's just backwards. [Speaking Arabic]
[The head of the Ten Rings, Raza, watches Tony and Yinsen test out one of the legs of the suit. He and his men go visit Tony and Yinsen.]
Raza: Relax. [Motioning for the two men to remove their hands from above their heads. They do so as Raza comes up and inspects Tony's arc reactor.] The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn. [Starts speaking in Urdu as he stares down Tony.] Why have you failed me?
Yinsen: We're working. Diligently. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Raza: [Turns and walks toward Yinsen.] I let you live. This is how you repay me? [Speaking in Urdu.]
Yinsen: It's very complex. He's trying very hard. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Raza: On his knees. [He commands his men in Urdu. Yinsen is forced to his knees.] You think I'm a fool? I'll get the truth. [Speaking in Urdu as he takes a coal from the dying fire.]
Yinsen: We're both working. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Raza: Open your mouth. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Tony Stark: What does he want?
Raza: You think I'm a fool? What's going on? Tell me the truth. [Speaking in Urdu. Raza forces Yinsen's head to lay on the table.]
Yinsen: He's building your Jericho. He's building your Jericho. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Tony Stark: What do you want? A delivery date? [Tony tries to go towards Raza and Yinsen but the other men pull their guns on him.] I need him. Good assistant.
Raza: You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile. 
[Tony is shown hammering the helmet of the suit to shape it. He cools it in water before setting on the table in front of Yinsen. Tony is shown wrapping his hands up and Yinsen lifting the suit up. Yinsen helps Tony suit up.]
Yinsen: Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again.
Tony Stark: 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.
[Raza notices on the security screens that Stark cannot be seen.]
Raza: Where is Stark? [Speaking Arabic]
Man: He was here a moment ago. [Speaking Arabic]
Raza: Go look for him. [Speaking Arabic]
[The men rush to the cell.]
Man: Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!
Tony Stark: Say something. Say something back to him.
Yinsen: He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
Tony Stark: Then speak Hungarian.
Yinsen: Okay. I know.
Tony Stark: What do you know? 
[The men are shouting through the door while Yinsen is shouting something back at them. The door is shown to have an explosive on it. The men try to open the door, only for it to explode. Raza watches this all on camera and orders his men down there.]
Tony Stark: How'd that work?
Yinsen: Oh, my goodness. It worked all right.
Tony Stark: That's what I do.
Yinsen: Let me finish this.
Tony Stark: Initialize the power sequence.
Yinsen: Okay.
Tony Stark: Now!
Yinsen: Tell me. Tell me. 
Tony Stark: Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.
Yinsen: Yes.
Tony Stark: Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
Yinsen: I have it.
Tony Stark: Press Control ""l"".
Yinsen: ""I."" 
Tony Stark: ""I."" ""Enter.""
Yinsen: Got it.
Tony Stark: ""l"" and ""Enter."" Come over here and button me up.
Yinsen: Okay. All right.
Tony Stark: Every other hex bolt.
Yinsen: They're coming!
Tony Stark: Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done.
Yinsen: They're coming.
Tony Stark: Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?
Yinsen: We need more time. Hey, I'm gonna go buy you some time.
Tony Stark: Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! [Yinsen runs out of the cave with a gun from one of the dead men.] Yinsen! Yinsen!
[Tony watches the progress bar move while Yinsen aimlessly shoots the cave walls as he runs, scarring the men. Yinsen is stopped when he reaches the mouth of the cave and a group of men. The progress bar finishes loading, causing the lights to dim, and the suit to be powered. More men arrive in the cave to get Tony. Tony attacks them using the suit. On his way out of the cave, he attacks more of the men. Raza waits at the mouth of the cave. Tony arrives to see Yinsen has been shot.]
Tony Stark: Yinsen!
Yinsen: Watch out! [Raza tries to shoot at Tony but misses. Tony shoots back, hitting the wall behind Raza, causing a mini explosion and knocking Raza out.] Stark.
Tony Stark: Come on. [Tony opens is helmet.] We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.
Yinsen: This was always the plan, Stark.
Tony Stark: Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up.
Yinsen: My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this.
Tony Stark: Thank you for saving me.
Yinsen: Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
[Yinsen dies. Tony turns angry. There are men waiting outside of the mouth of the cave. They all shoot at Tony in the suit, but don't do any damage.]
Tony Stark: My turn. [Tony shoots fire at the men and their camp from his suit. The men continue to shoot at Tony, beginning to cause damage to the suit. Tony flips a suit and shoots up in the air. He screams as he falls into the sand on the other side of the mountains. The suit breaks when he lands.] Not bad.
[Tony then is seen wondering through the desert, exhausted. Military helicopters fly up from behind him.]
Tony Stark: Hey! [Waving down the helicopters.] Hey!
[As one of the helicopters lands, Tony collapses to his knees, holding up a peace sign. Rhodey and a few men are seen running up to Tony from the helicopter.]
James Rhodes: How was the ""fun-vee""? Next time, you ride with me, okay?


[California Military Base where a giant plane has just landed. Medical, Happy, and Pepper are waiting there. The ramp lowers and Rhodey helps Tony down.]
James Rhodes: Watch it, coming up here.
Tony Stark: Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. [Tony walks up to Pepper.] Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
Pepper Potts: Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
Tony Stark: Yeah, vacation's over.
[Tony, Pepper, and Happy get into the car.]
Happy: Where to, sir?
Pepper Potts: Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
Tony Stark: No.
Pepper Potts: No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital.
Tony Stark: No is a complete answer.
Pepper Potts: The doctor has to look at you.
Tony Stark: I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...
Pepper Potts: That's enough of that.
Tony Stark: ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
Pepper Potts: Call for a press conference?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: What on earth for?
Tony Stark: Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.


[Happy driving them up to Stark Industries HQ, where Obadiah is waiting with the press and their employees.]
Obadiah Stane: Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.
Tony Stark: No, I'm fine.
Obadiah Stane: Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?
Tony Stark: Well, come on.
Obadiah Stane: You get me one of those?
Tony Stark: There's only one left. I need it.
Obadiah Stane: Hey, look who's here! Yeah!
Agent Coulson: Miss Potts?
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Agent Coulson: Can I speak to you for a moment?
Pepper Potts: I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now.
Agent Coulson: I'm not a reporter. I'm Agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Pepper Potts: That's quite a mouthful.
Agent Coulson: I know. We're working on it.
Pepper Potts: You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...
Agent Coulson: We're a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
Pepper Potts: I'll put something in the book, shall I?
Agent Coulson: Thank you.
Obadiah Stane: Well, let's get this started, uh...
Tony Stark: Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? [Sitting in front of the podium.] Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and... [Tony takes a bite of his cheeseburger as everyone sits, or squats, down]
James Rhodes: What's up with the love-in? 
Pepper Potts: Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to.
Tony Stark: Good to see you.
Obadiah Stane: Good to see you.
Tony Stark: I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.
Reporters: Mr. Stark!
Tony Stark: Hey, Ben.
Reporter (Ben): What happened over there?
Tony Stark: I had my eyes opened. [Tony stands and moves behind the podium.] I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International [Everyone stands up in commotion.] until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.
Obadiah Stane: I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers. [Standing up beside Tony.]
Tony Stark: What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. [Tony leaves the stage.]
Obadiah Stane: What we should take away from this is that Tony's back! And he's healthier than ever. We're going to have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with the follow-up. [Obadiah is shown on a Segway, riding up to one of the Stark buildings. Happy leaning against a car outside.] Where is he?
Happy: He's inside. 
[Obadiah goes inside to find Tony looking at the giant arc reactor.]
Obadiah Stane: Well, that..uh... That went well.
Tony Stark: Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
Obadiah Stane: Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
Tony Stark: Uh, optimistically, 40 points.
Obadiah Stane: At minimum.
Tony Stark: Yep.
Obadiah Stane: Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.
Tony Stark: Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.
Obadiah Stane: That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.
Tony Stark: It's my name on the side of the building.
Obadiah Stane: And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
Tony Stark: Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
Obadiah Stane: Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
Tony Stark: I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
Obadiah Stane: Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up.
Tony Stark: It works.
Obadiah Stane: Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?
Tony Stark: Maybe.
Obadiah Stane: Huh? Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.
Tony Stark: That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?
Obadiah Stane: Never mind who told me. Show me.
Tony Stark: It's Rhodey or Pepper.
Obadiah Stane: I want to see it.
Tony Stark: Okay, Rhodey. [Tony opens his shirt to show Obadiah the reactor in his chest.]
Obadiah Stane: Okay. [Obadiah begins to button Tony's shirt back up.]
Tony Stark: Okay? It works.
Obadiah Stane: Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had...
Obadiah Stane: Tony. Tony, no more of this ""ready, fire, aim"" business. You understand me?
Tony Stark: That was Dad's line.
Obadiah Stane: You gotta let me handle this. We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We're going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.


[Stark Mansion, where Pepper is watching the news.]
Newcaster: Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!
Tony Stark: [Over the intercoms] Pepper. How big are your hands?
Pepper Potts: What?
Tony Stark: How big are your hands?
Pepper Potts: I don't understand why...
Tony Stark: Get down here. I need you. [Pepper enters Tony's workshop to find Tony lying shirtless on a chair.] Hey. Let's see them. Show me your hands. Let's see them. [Pepper holds up her hands as she comes closer.] Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec.
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?
Tony Stark: It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.
Pepper Potts: Speed bump, what does that mean?
Tony Stark: It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine. [Tony pulls out the old device, handing it to Pepper.]
Pepper Potts: What do you want me to do?
Tony Stark: Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God! [Setting the old reactor on the table.]
Tony Stark: I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.
Pepper Potts: Is it safe?
Tony Stark: Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes ""beep.""
Pepper Potts: What do you mean, ""Operation""?
Tony Stark: It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire. 
Pepper Potts: Okay.
Tony Stark: Okay? Great.
Pepper Potts: You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.
Tony Stark: No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...
Pepper Potts: Okay, okay.
Tony Stark: I really need your help here.
Pepper Potts: Okay. [Slides her hand into the hole in Tony's chest.] Oh, there's pus!
Tony Stark: It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.
Pepper Potts: It smells!
Tony Stark: Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?
Pepper Potts: Okay, I got it! I got it!
Tony Stark: Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch [Pepper lets it touch the side.] the sides when you're coming out!
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tony Stark: That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't... [Pepper pulls out the wire with the magnet attached and the medical equipment starts beeping.] There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.
Pepper Potts: Oh, God!
Tony Stark: Okay, I was not expecting... 
Pepper Potts: Okay, what do I do?
Tony Stark: Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
Pepper Potts: What's wrong?
Tony Stark: Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest-- 
Pepper Potts: What? You said it was safe!
Tony Stark: 'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.
Pepper Potts: Okay. Okay. Tony? 
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper Potts: It's going to be okay. Okay?
Tony Stark: Is it?
Pepper Potts: It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.
Tony Stark: Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you... [Screams went it attaches.] Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice.
Pepper Potts: Are you okay?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I feel great. You okay?
Pepper Potts: Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.
Tony Stark: I don't have anyone but you. Anyway... [Tony rips on the wires off and stands up.]
Pepper Potts: What do you want me to do with this? [Holding Tony's old reactor.]
Tony Stark: That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
Pepper Potts: You don't want to keep it?
Tony Stark: Pepper, I've been called many things. ""Nostalgic"" is not one of them.
Pepper Potts: Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: That will be all, Miss Potts. [Turns to talk to his robot while he eyes Pepper as she walks away.] Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.


[Air Force Base where Rhodes is guiding a group of people through the hanger.]
James Rhodes: The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.
Tony Stark: Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
James Rhodes: Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.
Man: Hello, sir. 
Tony Stark: Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with.
James Rhodes: Don't do that!
Tony Stark: What was his name?
James Rhodes: Don't do that.
Tony Stark: Was it Ivan?
James Rhodes: Don't do that. They'll believe it. 
Tony Stark: Okay.
James Rhodes: Don't do that.
Tony Stark: Okay.  
James Rhodes: Don't do that.
Tony Stark: Pleasure meeting you.
James Rhodes: Give us a couple minutes, you guys. [The group walks off.] I'm surprised.
Tony Stark: Why?
James Rhodes: I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.
Tony Stark: I'm doing a little better than walking.
James Rhodes: Really?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.
James Rhodes: You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.
Tony Stark: This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
James Rhodes: What? You're a humanitarian now or something?
Tony Stark: I need you to listen to me.
James Rhodes: No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I'm serious.
Tony Stark: Okay.
James Rhodes: It's nice seeing you, Tony. [Rhodey walks off.]
Tony Stark: Thanks.


[Tony in his workshop, working on his computer and hologram table.]
Tony Stark: JARVIS, you up?
JARVIS: For you, sir, always.
Tony Stark: I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.
JARVIS: Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
Tony Stark: Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?
JARVIS: Working on a secret project, are we, sir?
Tony Stark: I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.


[men from the Ten Rings searching the desert for Tony's suit. Shows that part of Raza's face was burned]


[Tony working on a boot for the new suit in his workshop. His robot, Dummy, is assisting him.]
Tony Stark: Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy.


[Tony wearing the boots in his workshop for a test flight. One of the robots is filming it, while Dummy is in charge of the fire extinguisher.]
Tony Stark: Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one. 
[Tony immediately flings back and hits the upper wall. Dummy uses the fire extinguisher on him. Tony is then seen working on flight stabilizers for his hands/arms. While he's working, Pepper comes in with a wrapped box and a cup of something.]
Tony Stark: Up two. All right, set that.
Pepper Potts: I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
Tony Stark: Yeah, everything's... What? [Still distracted with the flight stabilizer.]
Pepper Potts: Obadiah's upstairs.
Tony Stark: Great!
Pepper Potts: What would you like me to tell him?
Tony Stark: Great. I'll be right up.
Pepper Potts: Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.
Tony Stark: It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless. [The stabilizer shoots, flinging Tony backwards and scaring Pepper.] I didn't expect that. [Tony then comes up stairs to find Obadiah playing the piano and Pepper working on the couch.] How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?
Obadiah Stane: Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad. [Still playing the piano.]
Tony Stark: Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
Obadiah Stane: It would have gone better if you were there.
Tony Stark: Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...
Obadiah Stane: Hey, come on. In public. The press. [Comes over to sit next to Tony.] This was a board of directors meeting.
Tony Stark: This was a board of directors meeting?
Obadiah Stane: The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They're filing an injunction.
Tony Stark: A what?
Obadiah Stane: They want to lock you out.
Tony Stark: Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.
Pepper Potts: Fifty-six and a half.
Tony Stark: It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
Obadiah Stane: Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction isn't in the company's best interest.
Tony Stark: I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. [Tony stands up, taking the pizza box with him. Obadiah follows.]
Obadiah Stane: Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
Tony Stark: I'll be in the shop.
Obadiah Stane: Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.
Tony Stark: No. No, absolutely not.
Obadiah Stane: It'll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!
Tony Stark: This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it.
Obadiah Stane: All right, well, this stays with me, then. [Obadiah takes the pizza box back.] Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two.
Tony Stark: Thank you.
Obadiah Stane: You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?
Tony Stark: Good night, Obie. [Tony heads back down to his workshop]


Tony Stark: [running another flight test, this time wearing the boots and hand flight stabilizers] Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground and hovers for a bit before landing.] Okay. Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground with less control and starts hovering all over the workshop.] Okay, this is where I don't want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay. [Lands where he started. Dummy goes to use the fire extinguisher.] No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.


[Tony fully suiting up in the Mark II.]
Tony Stark: JARVIS, are you there?
JARVIS: At your service, sir.
Tony Stark: Engage heads-up display.
JARVIS: Check.
Tony Stark: Import all preferences from home interface.
JARVIS: Will do, sir.
Tony Stark: All right, what do you say?
JARVIS: I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready.
Tony Stark: Can we start the virtual walk-around?
JARVIS: Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
Tony Stark: Do a check on control surfaces
JARVIS: As you wish. [The full suit is shown.] Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
Tony Stark: Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.
JARVIS: Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is...
Tony Stark: JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one. [Begins hovering and flies out of the garage into the sky.] Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?
JARVIS: The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.
Tony Stark: Records are made to be broken! Come on! [Begins flying straight up.]
JARVIS: Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.
Tony Stark: Keep going! Higher! [Ice builds up around the suit, causing it to stop working and him to start flying from the sky.] We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice! 
[Tony manually gets the flaps up. The power starts just it time before he crashes into traffic. He heads back to the mansion and hovers above it, hoping to safely land on the roof.]
Tony Stark: Kill power. 
[Power is killed and Tony falls through the roof, the piano, and down into his workshop, landing on top of a car. Dummy uses the fire extinguisher on him]


[Tony out of the suit, walking around the workshop with an ice pack on his head. He picks up the cup that Pepper left earlier and notices the package she left. On top, it has a sticky note saying 'from Pepper'. He takes it off and opens the package.]
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
JARVIS: A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.
Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.
- Got it?
- Yes.
Shall I render using proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
TV Reporter: Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, we get an invite for that?
JARVIS: I have no record of an invitation, sir.
TV Reporter: ... hasn't been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he's suffering from post traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight.
JARVIS: The render is complete.
Tony Stark: A little ostentatious, don't you think?
JARVIS: What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tony Stark: Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
JARVIS: Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.
Tony Stark: Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
JARVIS: Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
Tony Stark: Don't wait up for me, honey.
Weapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...
Random Woman: Hey, Tony, remember me?
Tony Stark: Sure don't. You look great, Hef.
Obadiah Stane: We're going to have a great quarter.
Tony Stark: What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
Obadiah Stane: Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.
Tony Stark: I'll see you inside.
Obadiah Stane: Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them
Tony Stark: You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
Agent Coulson: Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Agent Coulson: Agent Coulson.
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..
Agent Coulson: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Tony Stark: God, you need a new name for that.
Agent Coulson: Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things.
Tony Stark: Let's just put something on the books.
Agent Coulson: How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?
Tony Stark: Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you.
Pepper Potts: What are you doing here?
Tony Stark: Just avoiding government agents.
Pepper Potts: Are you by yourself?
Tony Stark: Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
Pepper Potts: Oh, it was a birthday present.
Tony Stark: That's great.
Pepper Potts: From you, actually.
Tony Stark: Well, I got great taste.
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Tony Stark: You want to dance?
Pepper Potts: Oh, no.
Tony Stark: All right, come on.
Pepper Potts: Thank you. No.
Tony Stark: Am I making you uncomfortable?
Pepper Potts: No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.
Tony Stark: You look great and you smell great.
Pepper Potts: Oh, God.
Tony Stark: But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
Pepper Potts: I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.
Tony Stark: I'd make it a week. Sure.
Pepper Potts: Really? What's your Social Security number?
Tony Stark: Five.
Pepper Potts: Five?
Tony Stark: Right.
Pepper Potts: Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there.
Tony Stark: The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?
Pepper Potts: Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird.
Tony Stark: Totally harmless.
Pepper Potts: It was totally not harmless, by the way.
Tony Stark: We're dancing. No one's even watching.
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.
Pepper Potts: No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, and I'm dancing with you.
Tony Stark: I don't think it was taken that way.
Pepper Potts: Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to...
Tony Stark: I just think you're overstating it.
Pepper Potts: You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please.
Tony Stark: Got it, okay.
Pepper Potts: I would like a vodka martini, please.
Tony Stark: Okay.
Pepper Potts: Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.
Tony Stark: Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?
Christine Everhart: Wow. Tony Stark.
Tony Stark: Oh, hey.
Christine Everhart: Fancy seeing you here.
Tony Stark: Carrie.
Christine Everhart: Christine.
Tony Stark: Carrie.
Christine Everhart: Christine.
Tony Stark: That's right.
Christine Everhart: You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?
Tony Stark: Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
Christine Everhart: 'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity
Tony Stark: Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
Christine Everhart: I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.
Tony Stark: I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.
Christine Everhart: Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?
Tony Stark: When were these taken?
Christine Everhart: Yesterday.
Tony Stark: I didn't approve any shipment.
Christine Everhart: Well, your company did.
Tony Stark: Well, I'm not my company.
Obadiah Stane: Please, do you mind?
Tony Stark: Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
Obadiah Stane: Tony, Tony. You can't afford to be this naive.
Tony Stark: You know what? I was naive before, when they said, ""Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business."" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?
Reporter: Tony, your picture, please!
Obadiah Stane: Let's take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you.
Obadiah Stane: No. No.
TV Reporter: The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, ""Where are my mother and father?"" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.
Tony Stark: He's all yours.


Captain: What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?
CAOC Analyst #1: No sir, they were using human shields. We never got the green light
Major Allen: Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): Get those monitors up!
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): We got a bogey!
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): Wasn't Air Force!
Major Allen: We got the CIA on the line?
Captain: I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us.
CAOC Analyst #1: No, it definitely is not us, sir!
CAOC Analyst #2: It wasn't Navy.
CAOC Analyst #3: Wasn't Marines.
Major Allen: I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): Negative, negative. Cannot identify.
Major Allen: Get me Colonel Rhodes from weapons development down here now!
Major Allen: We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing.
James Rhodes: Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?
Captain: We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.
James Rhodes: So, this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn't show up on the radar?
CAOC Analyst #1: Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.
James Rhodes: Is it stealth?
CAOC Analyst #1: No, sir, it's tiny. We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.
Major Allen: Colonel, what are we dealing with here?
James Rhodes: Let me make a call.
Major Allen: Sergeant, clear a hole.
Tony Stark: Hello?
James Rhodes: Tony?
Tony Stark: Who's this?
James Rhodes: It's Rhodes.
Tony Stark: Sorry, hello?
James Rhodes: I said it's Rhodes.
Tony Stark: Speak up, please.
James Rhodes: What in the hell is that noise?
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
James Rhodes: Yeah, well, I need your help right now.
Tony Stark: It's funny how that works, huh?
James Rhodes: Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive.
Tony Stark: Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?
James Rhodes: Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?
Tony Stark: I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.
James Rhodes: I thought you were driving.
Tony Stark: Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.
James Rhodes: You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
Tony Stark: Nope!
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): Bogey spotted!
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): Whiplash, come in hot.
James Rhodes: Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.
Tony Stark: That's my exit.
Pilot #1: Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sights.
James Rhodes: Whiplash One, what is it?
Pilot #1: I've got no idea.
Major Allen: You have radio contact?
Pilot #1: Non responsive, sir.
Major Allen: Then you are clear to engage.
Tony Stark: Hit it.
Pilot #1: That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!
JARVIS: Inbound missile.
Tony Stark: Flares!
Pilot #1: Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!
Tony Stark: Deploy flaps!
Pilot #2: Holy!
CAOC Analyst (offscreen): That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.
CAOC Analyst #2: The sat visual has been lost.
Pilot #1: No way that's a UAV.
Major Allen: What is it?
Pilot #2: I can't see anything.
Pilot #1: Whatever it was, it just bought the farm. I think bogey's been handled, sir.
James Rhodes: Hello?
Tony Stark: Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
James Rhodes: It's who?
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.
James Rhodes: No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?
Tony Stark: This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Major Allen: Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Major Allen: Mark your position and return to base.
Pilot #1: Roger that, Ballroom.
Pilot #1: On your belly! It looks like a man! Shake him off! Roll! Roll! I'm hit! I'm hit!
It's confirmed. He has been hit.
Pilot #2: Punch out! Punch out! Whiplash One down.
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?
Pilot #2: Negative! No chute, no chute!
Pilot #1: My chute's jammed!
Pilot #2: Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.
Major Allen: Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.
James Rhodes: Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
Major Allen: That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!
JARVIS: You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.
Tony Stark1: Keep going!
Pilot #2: Good chute! Good chute!
James Rhodes: Tony, you still there?
Tony Stark: Hey, thanks.
James Rhodes: Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?
Tony Stark: Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?
James Rhodes: No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?
Tony Stark: Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
James Rhodes: It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved. 
Tony Stark: Hey!
JARVIS: It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.
Tony Stark: Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...
JARVIS: Please, try not to move, sir.
Pepper Potts: What's going on here?
Tony Stark: Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Pepper Potts: Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
Obadiah Stane: If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face.
Raza: You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your guards outside.
His escape bore unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first, crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
If we are still in business,
I will give you these designs
as a gift.
And in turn,
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.
Technology.
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.
That's the least of your problems.
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.
All right, let's finish up here.
Set up Sector underneath the arc reactor,
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Tony Stark: Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.
Pepper Potts: And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?
Tony Stark: Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.
Pepper Potts: Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.
Tony Stark: There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
Pepper Potts: Is that so? Well, then, I quit.
Tony Stark: You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
Pepper Potts: You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.
Tony Stark: I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
Pepper Potts: You're all I have, too, you know. Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?
Video Voice Over: You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God.
Video Voice Over: ... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.
Obadiah Stane: So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you're going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart.
Pepper Potts: Well, he's a complicated person.
Obadiah Stane: He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right. You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.
Pepper Potts: Thank you. Thanks. I'd better get back there.
Obadiah Stane: Is that today's paper?
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Obadiah Stane: Do you mind?
Pepper Potts: Not at all.
Obadiah Stane: Puzzle.
Of course.
Take care.
Agent Coulson: Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?
Pepper Potts: Nope, right now. Come with me.
Agent Coulson: Right now?
Pepper Potts: We're going to have it right now. Yeah, walk with me.
Agent Coulson: Okay.
Pepper Potts: I'm going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.
Yeah, we've been working our best to do it.
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.
- Actually...
- A hiccup?
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.
- So, it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.
Obadiah Stane: Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.
Pepper Potts: Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello?
Obadiah Stane: Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It's a shame the government didn't approve it. There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it's beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could've seen my prototype. It's not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived.
James Rhodes: What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where's Tony now?
Pepper Potts: I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.
Tony Stark: Good boy.
James Rhodes: Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?
Tony Stark: Where's Pepper?
James Rhodes: She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah.
Tony Stark: That's not going to be enough.
Pepper Potts: Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key's not working. It's not opening the door. Oh, wow! What's that? It's, like, a little device. It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?
Agent Coulson: You might want to take a few steps back.
James Rhodes: That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Tony Stark: Not bad, huh? Let's do it.
James Rhodes: You need me to do anything else?
Tony Stark: Keep the skies clear.
James Rhodes: Damn! Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.
I thought it'd be bigger.
Tony Stark: How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
JARVIS: The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.
Tony Stark: Keep me posted. Pepper!
Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony, are you okay?
Tony Stark: I'm fine. How are...
Pepper Potts: Obadiah, he's gone insane!
Tony Stark: I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there.
Pepper Potts: He built a suit.
Tony Stark: Get out of there right now!
Where do you think you're going?
Your services are no longer required.
Stane!
I love this suit!
- Put them down!
Obadiah Stane: Collateral damage, Tony.
Divert power to chest RT.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!
I built this company from nothing!
Nothing is going to stand in my way.
Least of all you!
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!
I've made some upgrades of my own!
JARVIS: Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.
Tony Stark: Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
JARVIS: With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--
Tony Stark: I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!
James Rhodes: Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.
Yes, sir.
JARVIS: Thirteen percent power, sir.
Tony Stark: Climb!
JARVIS: Eleven percent.
Tony Stark: Keep going!
JARVIS: Seven percent power.
Tony Stark: Just leave it on the screen!
Stop telling me!
Obadiah Stane: You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!
Tony Stark: How'd you solve the icing problem?
Obadiah Stane: Icing problem?
Tony Stark: Might want to look into it.
JARVIS: Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.
Tony Stark: Potts!
Pepper Potts: Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?
Tony Stark: I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
Nice try!
- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.
Flares!
Very clever, Tony.
Tony Stark: Potts?
Pepper Potts: Tony!
Tony Stark: This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
Pepper Potts: Well, how are you going to do that?
Tony Stark: You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here.
Pepper Potts: Okay. I'm going in now.
Tony Stark: Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important!
Obadiah Stane: I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You'd have made your father proud!
Pepper Potts: It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!
Obadiah Stane: How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!
Tony Stark: Pepper!
Obadiah Stane: And now I'm going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!
Tony Stark: Time to hit the button!
Pepper Potts: You told me not to!
Obadiah Stane: Hold still, you little prick!
Tony Stark: Just do it!
Pepper Potts: You'll die!
Tony Stark: Push it!
Pepper Potts: Tony!
You've all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...
Tony Stark: ""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.
Agent Coulson: Here's your alibi.
Okay.
Agent Coulson: You were on your yacht.
Yeah.
Agent Coulson: We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.
Tony Stark: See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.
Agent Coulson: That's what happened.
All right.
Agent Coulson: Just read it, word for word.
Tony Stark: There's nothing about Stane here.
Agent Coulson: That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.
Tony Stark: But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?
Agent Coulson: This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Pepper Potts: Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.
Agent Coulson: That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.
Pepper Potts: From the Strategic Homeland...
Agent Coulson: Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Pepper Potts: Right. Let's get this show on the road.
Tony Stark: You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.
Pepper Potts: You're not Iron Man.
Tony Stark:  Am so.
Pepper Potts: You're not.
Tony Stark:  All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.
Pepper Potts: What night?
Tony Stark: You know.
Pepper Potts: Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.
James Rhodes: And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions.
Tony Stark: Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
Christine Everhart: I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you...
Tony Stark: I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
Christine Everhart: I never said you were a superhero.
Tony Stark: Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public. 
James Rhodes: Just stick to the cards, man.
Tony Stark: Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.
[After end-credits. Tony reaches home]
Tony Stark: Jarvis!
JARVIS: [distorted] Welcome home, Sir. [Jarvis cuts out]
Nick Fury: ""I am Iron Man."" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.
Tony Stark: Who the hell are you?
Nick Fury: [appears in light] Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Tony Stark: [nonchalantly] Ah.
Nick Fury: I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative."

 The Incredible Hulk
 Thor

[scrolling is too long]

Tony (V.O.): Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…
Christine Everhart (V.O.): Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
Tony (V.O.): Yes
MOSCOW
Christine (V.O.): And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle…
Tony (V.O.): I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.
Switch to view of a TV
Tony (on TV): I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.
Anton Vanko [Russian]: Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.
Ivan Vanko [Russian]: Don’t listen to that crap
Anton Vanko [Russian]: I’m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.
(Anton coughs and dies. Ivan is naturally distraught. Takes a swig of vodka. Pulls out blueprints for an arc reactor. Engineering montage as opening credits roll.)



IRON MAN 2


Man (V.O): 270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone
(ACDC’s Shoot to Thrill starts to play)
6 MONTHS LATER
(And a picture of Iron Man with an opening door in the bottom of an aeroplane. And he jumps out said aeroplane, landing on a stage. All very ostentatious. Dancing girls. Fireworks.)
STARK EXPO – FLUSHING, NEW YORK.
(Dismantling Iron Man suit.)
Pretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
Tony: It’s good to be back. You missed me?
Man in crowd: Blow something up!
Tony: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
Woman in crowd: I love you Tony!
Tony: Please, it’s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
Howard Stark (on a screen, courtesy of a video recording): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, [Tony is off the stage, doing something. Blood toxicity test. Gives a reading of 19%. Not good] and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.



[Video ends. Cut to news feed of reporter outside.]
Reporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.


Happy Hogan: Make sure you join me…
Tony: All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.
Happy: Open up, let’s go.
[Image is Tony trying to pass through the crowd, from Tony’s perspective.]
Tony: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.
People: Tony, Tony
Tony: Hey, hey.
Woman: Call me.
Happy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Tony: [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.
Happy: Okay
Tony: [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy
Happy: This is Larry.
Tony: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.
Larry: Call me. Call me.
Happy: Larry King.
Tony: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.
Happy: [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go.
Tony: Very mellow.
Happy: That wasn’t so bad.
Tony: No, it was perfect.
Happy: Look what we got here, the new model.
Tony: Hey, does she come with the car?
Happy: I certainly hope so. Hi.
Tony: Hi. And you are?
Woman: Marshal.
Tony: Irish. I like it.
Marshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.
Tony: I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
Marshal: Bedford.
Tony: What are you doing here?
Marshal: Looking for you.
Tony: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
Marshal: Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn’t take it]
Tony: Yikes.
Happy: [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn’t like to be handed things.
Tony: Yeah, I have a peeve.
Marshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.
Tony: Can I see a badge?
Marshal: You wanna see the badge?
Happy: He likes the badge.
Marshal: [showing him her badge.] You still like it?
Tony: Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?
Happy: D.C.? 250 miles.
[Drive off. Image slides over, like when you used to make Powerpoints with all the transitions. It now shows Washing D.C. You can tell because words appear saying…]
WASHINGTON D.C.
Senator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.
Tony: [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?
Senator Stern: Can I have your attention?
Tony: Absolutely.
Stern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
Tony: I do not.
Stern: You do not?
Tony: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.
Stern: The Iron Man weapon.
Tony: My device does not fit that description.
Stern: Well… How would you describe it?
Tony: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
Stern: As?
Tony: It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
Stern: It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.
Tony: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…
Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
Tony: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.
Stern: Look, I’m no expert…
Tony: In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
[People laugh. He waves. Pepper does not look impressed at all. He mouths “no?” and she shakes her head.]
Stern: I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.
Tony: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
Justin Hammer: Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.
Stern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
Tony: Rhodey? What?
[Rhodey walks in, Tony gets up to greet him] \
Tony: Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.
Rhodey: Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.
Tony: I just…
Rhodey: Drop it.
Tony: All right, I’ll drop it.
Stern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?
Rhodey: You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?
Stern: Yes, sir.
Rhodey: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.
Stern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…
Rhodey: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…
Stern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.
Rhodey: Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…
Stern: That’s enough Colonel
Rhodey: …to fold Mr Stark…
Stern: That’s enough
Rhodey: …into the existing chain of command, Senator.
Tony: I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.
[Laughs from crowd.]
Tony: We can amend the hours a little bit.
Stern: I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.
Rhodey: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.
Stern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.
Rhodey: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…
[Tony is doing something on a Stark device]
Rhodey: … indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.
Tony: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.
Stern: What is he doing?
Tony: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn’t work very well at all.]
Stern: Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]
Tony: Iran.
[This suit can fly. For all of five seconds before crashing, judging by the smoke, probably on fire. Justin is by the screen, trying to find the off switch.]
Tony: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
[Yep, it’s a video of Justin Hammer. With a suit. Again that really doesn’t work.]
Tony: Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up.
TV Justin: Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[Language Justin]
Tony: [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.
Justin: I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.
Stern: I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…
Tony: The point is, you’re welcome, I guess
Stern: For what?
Tony: Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.
[Stands up and turns around to face the crowd]
Tony: I’ve successfully privatised world peace.
[Both hands make peace signs and everyone stands up, all talking at once]
Tony: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
Stern: [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.
Tony: [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey’s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they’re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.
Stern: You’ve been a delight.
[Kind of scene change. It’s now on a television on a Russian news channel with Russian dubbing. Because it’s a film where the selected language is English, we can still here the English clearer than the Russian. We’re back to Ivan.]
Tony (on TV): My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.
[Ivan is still working. There’s things going blue. It works. It’s not a full suit, but it does now look like he has whips made of lightning. Scene change. Tony’s house. He’s in his workshop. Pans in from across the ocean]
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony: Wake up, Daddy’s home.
Jarvis (V.O., A.I): Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.
[One of the robots is trying to make a smoothie. Without a blender lid]
Tony: You!
[You knocks over the blender. Well, he tried.]
Tony: I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.
[You looks down, sad.]
Tony: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
Jarvis: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.
[Tony downs green liquid]
Tony: Check palladium levels.
[Using the same machine as before]
Jarvis: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.
Tony: [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they’re running out quick.
Jarvis: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.
[Tony inputs a new core. It’s silver, giving a judgment of just how badly damaged the other one was. Replaces Arc Reactor in chest.]
Jarvis: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.
[Which we can see from the image of Tony’s chest on the computer screen. There’s blue lines all around the Arc Reactor. Camera angle shifts to focus on his actual chest.]
Jarvis: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…
Tony: Mute.
[Shirt back down, computers switched to screen saver, Pepper inputs a code and opens the door]
Pepper: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?
Tony: What?
Pepper: What are you thinking?
Tony: Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.
Pepper: Did you just donate…
Tony: Keep your business.
[Both walking around the room]
Pepper: …our entire modern art collection to the…
Tony: Boy Scouts of America.
Pepper: …Boy Scouts of America?
Tony: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.
Pepper: No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.
Tony: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
Pepper: You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.
Tony: [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.
Pepper: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
Tony: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
Pepper: That’s rude.
Tony: There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
Pepper: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
Tony: [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
Pepper: You’ve got to be kidding.
Tony: I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
Pepper: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?
Tony: No. Our stocks have never been higher.
Pepper: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
Tony: You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.
Pepper: Let me give you an example.
Tony: Let’s move onto another subject.
Pepper: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.
Tony: I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
[Tony is now stood on a desk about to take down the Barnett Newman to put the Iron Man picture up].
Tony: Let’s see what I can get going on here.
Pepper: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.
Tony: Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
Pepper: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…
Tony: Everything was my idea.
Pepper: …and you won’t make a decision.
Tony: I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.
Pepper: I do what?
Tony: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
Pepper: Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.
Tony: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
Pepper: You will not give me the information…
Tony: I’m not asking you to try…
Pepper: …in order to…
Tony: I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
Pepper: I am trying to do it.
Tony: Pepper, you’re not listening to me!
Pepper: No, you are not listening to me.
Tony: I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
Pepper: Have you been drinking?
Tony: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn’t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.
Pepper: I don’t know what to think.
Tony: Don’t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]
[We’re back in Russia. A man hands Ivan a letter down a twitten, out of sight. It contains a fake passport and a ticket. Another scene change. Tony and Happy are boxing. Pepper walks in.]
Pepper: The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
Tony: I’m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.
Happy: What the hell was that?
Tony: It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
Happy: It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it
Tony: All right, put them up. Come on. [The Notary walks in. Both Happy and Tony’s attention shifts to her]
Pepper: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.
Notary: I need you to initial each box.
Happy: [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off… [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]
Tony: That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?
Notary: Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to the Notary as Natalie]
Tony: Front and centre. Come into the church.
Pepper: No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…
Tony: If it pleases the court, which it does.
Natalie: [To Pepper] It’s no problem.
Pepper: [To Natalie] I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.
[Natalie enters ring. Tony swigs down more green liquid out of a bottle]
Tony: Can you give her a lesson?
Happy: No problem.
Tony: [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.
Pepper: What?
Tony: [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?
Pepper: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.
Tony: I need a new assistant, boss.
Pepper: Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.
Tony: I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
Pepper: No, it’s not.
Happy: You ever boxed before?
Natalie: I have, yes.
Happy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie’s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]
Tony: How do I spell your name, Natalie?
Natalie: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
Pepper: What, are you gonna google her now?
Tony: I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie’s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
Pepper: You’re so predictable, you know that?
Tony: She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?
Pepper: No one speaks Latin.
Tony: No one speaks Latin
Pepper: It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.
Tony: Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
Pepper: Well…
Tony: I need her. She’s got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]
Happy: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]
Pepper: Oh, my God! Happy.
Tony: That’s what I’m talking about.
Happy: I just slipped.
Tony: You did?
Happy: [Who looks a little like he’s in pain] Yeah.
Tony: Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings the bell and Natalie leaves the ring]
Natalie: Just… I need your impression.
Tony: You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul.
Natalie: I meant your fingerprint.
Tony: Right.
Pepper: So, how are we doing?
Tony: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
Natalie: Will that be all, Mr Stark?
Tony: No.
Pepper: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]
Tony: I want one.
Pepper: No.
[News report is heard. In French. It’s about the Grand Prix. 
Tony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]
Tony: You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.
Pepper: Go with it? Go with what?
Natalie: Mr Stark?
Tony: Hey.
Natalie: Hello. How was your flight?
Tony: It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you.
Natalie: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?
Pepper: When did this happen?
Tony: What? You made me do it.
Pepper: I made you do what?
Tony: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.
Pepper: You are so predictable.
Tony: That’s the amazing thing.
Natalie: Right this way.
Tony: You look fantastic.
Natalie: Why, thank you very much.
Tony: But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
Natalie: You have a 9:30 dinner.
Tony: Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
Natalie: Absolutely.
Tony: Is this us?
Natalie: It can be.
Tony: Great. Make it us.
Natalie: Okay.
Pepper: Mr Musk. How are you?
Mr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.
Pepper: Thank you very much.
Tony: Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.
Mr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet.
Tony: You do?
Mr Musk: Yeah.
Tony: Then we’ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?
Pepper: Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage.
Tony: I’ll have Natalie make an…
Pepper: I don’t want Natalie to do…
Tony: Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.
Pepper: Thank you very much.
Tony: Green is not your best colour. [Justin’s head appears from behind someone]
Pepper: Oh, please.
Justin: Anthony. Is that you?
Tony: [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.
Justin: Hey, pal.
Tony: Justin Hammer.
Justin: How you doing? You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]
Christine: Hi. Yes.
Pepper: Yes.
Tony: Yes, roughly.
Pepper: We do.
Justin: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.
Christine: I know, I know.
Justin: Congratulations.
Christine: My editor will kill me if I don’t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
Pepper: Oh.
Christine: Can I?
Pepper: Sure.
Justin: She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?
Pepper: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.
Tony: And she wrote a story as well.
Pepper: It was very impressive.
Tony: That was good.
Pepper: It was very well done.
Christine: Thank you.
Pepper: I’m gonna go wash.
Tony: Don’t leave me.
Justin: Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Tony: I’m all right.
Justin: Looking gorgeous.
Tony: Please, this is tough.
Christine: Can I ask you… Is this the first time…
Justin: [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say “Brie”.
Christine: …that you guys have seen each other?
Tony: God, that’s so awful.
Christine: Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?
Tony: Since he got his contract revoked…
Justin: Actually, it’s on hold.
Tony: …when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?
Christine: Yes, what is it?
Justin: No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.
Tony: Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot.
Natalie: Mr Stark?
Tony: Yes?
Natalie: Your corner table is ready.
Justin: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.
Tony: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
Justin: We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders.
[Tony is doing another test. It reads Blood toxicity 53%. He’s in a bathroom.]
Tony: [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?
[And now he’s in a racing suit, jumping over the barrier towards a car.]
Justin: [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…
Tony (on TV behind Justin): Well, what’s the use of having…
Justin: …is a healthy…
Tony: …and owning a race car…
Justin: …competition.
Tony: …if you don’t drive it?
Justin: Is he driving?
[Camera shift to Pepper sitting at her table, probably waiting for Tony. She notices the television.]
Pepper: Natalie. Natalie!
Natalie: Yes, Ms Potts?
Pepper: What do you know about this?
Natalie: This is the first that I have known of it.
Pepper: This, this cannot happen.
Natalie: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?
Pepper: Where’s Happy?
Natalie: He’s waiting outside.
Pepper: Okay, get him. I need Happy.
Natalie: Right away.
Justin: Tony’s… You know, he… We’re not competitive. You know what I mean?
Christine: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?
Justin: Just read me what you wrote.
Christine: I will. I will, after.
Justin: Just read it back to me.
Christine: But I have to make one quick phone call.
Justin: Where are you going?
Christine: This is great.
Justin: I’ve got some caviar coming.
Christine: This is great stuff. I’ll be right back.
Someone in background: Look! That’s Stark.
[And engines revving, set, go! The race takes off. A man dressed in orange as pit crew walks beside the track. He looks familiar. Tony’s surprisingly not bad at this race car driving. Orange man is on the track. Oh look, it’s Ivan. More French words. I got a “Mon Dieu” I think. The lightning whips strike a car. Pepper looks terrified. For Tony. Another “Mon Dieu” from the French commentator. Means “My God” by the way. Happy appears at the door and holds up the briefcase. Pepper goes with him to the car and gets in the back.]
Pepper: Go, go.
Happy: Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony’s car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]
Pepper: Give me the case.
Happy: Here, take it.
Pepper: Where’s the key?
Happy: It’s in my pocket.
Pepper: Car!
[Ivan slices more of Tony’s car, but he’s gone. Tony comes up from behind him and whacks him around the head with a sheet of metal. Fighting. Tony is knocked on the floor. Sees dripping petrol. Ivan begins to swings the whips. Tony moves, hits petrol and the car bursts into flames. Happy appears, driving and runs Ivan into the fence. Tony is up the fence]
Tony: Are you okay?
Happy: Yeah.
Tony: Were you heading from me or him?
Happy: I was trying to scare him.
Tony: ‘Cause I can’t tell!
Pepper: Are you out of your mind?
Tony: Better security.
Pepper: Get in the car right now!
Tony: I was attacked. We need better security.
Happy: Get in the car.
Tony: You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing. [Ivan’s head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it’s a Rolls, be nicer to her]
Pepper: Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]
Happy: I got him!
Tony: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
Happy: I got him.
Pepper: Take the case! Take it!
Tony: Give him the case!
Pepper: Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]
Tony: Calm down.
Pepper: God. God.
Tony: Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan’s suit.]
Ivan: [Being taken away by the police] You… You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]
[Scene change. In a prison.]
Police officer [French]: We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.
Tony [French]: Where are we going?
Police Officer [French]: Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.
Tony [French]: Five minutes.
Police officer [French]: [opening door] Five minutes. {Door is shut behind Tony.]
Tony: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.
Ivan: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.
Tony: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
Ivan: My father. Anton Vanko.
Tony: Well, I never heard of him.
Ivan: My father is the reason you’re alive.
Tony: The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.
Ivan: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.
Tony: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]
Ivan: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]
[Scene change. On Tony’s private aeroplane. Stern is on the television]
Stern: It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”
Tony: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.
Pepper: What is that?
Tony: This is your in-flight meal.
Pepper: Did you just make that?
Tony: Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
Pepper: Tony, what are you not telling me?
Tony: I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?
Pepper: Oh, yes.
Tony: It’s a great place to be healthy.
Pepper: I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.
Tony: Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…
Pepper: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.
Tony: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
Pepper: A leave?
Tony: A company retreat.
Pepper: A retreat? During a time like this?
Tony: Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
Pepper: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.
[Ivan is in a cell. A guard drops of food. Someone’s left a note about enjoying the potatoes. That would be easier if they were potatoes and not an explosive. A man enters, dressed like Ivan, down to the number. Ivan escapes. More French shouting. There was defiantly an “allez” in there. Ivan gets knocked out. He awakens somewhere else]
Justin: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?
Jack: We have some salmon carpaccio.
Justin: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy.
Ivan: [Russian; no subs unintelligible]
Justin: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?
Ivan: Very good, man.
Justin: Very good, man.
Ivan: Very good, man.
Justin: Hey!
Ivan: [clinking bottle with Justin’s glass] Hey.
Justin: Yes?
Ivan: I want my bird.
Justin: A bird? You want a bird?
Ivan: I want my bird.
Justin: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.
Ivan: I want my bird.
Justin: Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?
[Scene change. Pepper and Natalie are back in Malibu.]
Pepper: [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.
Natalie: [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote.
Pepper: [covers speaker] Don’t tell them. Fax them…
Rhodey: [entering] Where is he?
Natalie: He doesn’t want to be disturbed.
Pepper: He’s downstairs.
News reader (on television): But what happened in Monaco?
Pepper: Yes, but….
News reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”
Pepper: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.
[Scene change. Tony is sitting in a car in his workshop looking at holograms.]
JARVIS: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]
Rhodey: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?
Tony: Let’s go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]
Rhodey: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?
Tony: Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony: It’s palladium.
Rhodey: [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?
Tony: If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.
Rhodey: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
Tony: Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?
Rhodey: I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.
Tony: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.
QUEENS, NEW YORK.
Justin: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff.
Ivan: [Something Russian] unintelligible
Justin: Sorry?
Ivan: Software shit.
Justin: Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait! [Ivan pulls off one’s head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it.
Ivan: What you want them do?
Justin: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?
Ivan: I can do that. No problem.
Justin: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling.
[Tony’s rash on his chest is getting worse. Natalie enters.]
Natalie: Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?
Tony: I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
Natalie: Probably.
Tony: Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
Natalie: Ill-timed.
Tony: Right, sends the wrong message.
Natalie: Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?
Tony: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I’ll take that. Why don’t you… [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?
Natalie: Legal.
Tony: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?
Natalie: I’d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He’s now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]
Person: Good evening
Person: Good evening
Rhodey: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I’ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper.
Pepper: I’m going to get some air.
Rhodey: What’s wrong?
Pepper: [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don’t know what to do.
Rhodey: You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That’s it, I’m making….
Pepper: No, no, no. Don’t call anyone.
Rhodey: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
Pepper: I know. I know. I get it. I’m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.
Rhodey: Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.
Tony: [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, “Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?” Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]
Pepper: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
Tony: I love you.
Pepper: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.
Tony: No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles.
Pepper: You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?
Tony: You’re out of control gorgeous.
Pepper: It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.
Tony: Give me another smooch
Pepper: You’re not going to be happy about this.
Tony: Come on, you know you want to.
Pepper: You just peed in the suit.
Tony: I know. It has a filtration system.
Pepper: It’s not sexy.
Tony: You could drink that water.
Pepper: Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…
Tony: If you say so.
Pepper: Okay. I’ll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]
Tony: Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!
Rhodey: [In full suit] I’m only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
Tony: [To DJ] Goldstein.
Goldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?
Tony: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]
Rhodey: [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]
Tony: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick.
Rhodey: [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?
[Quick camera angle shift]
Pepper: Natalie!
Natalie: Miss Potts.
Pepper: Don’t you “Miss Potts” me! I’m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here… [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]
Happy: Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]
Tony: You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]
Rhodey: Put you hand down.
Tony: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
Rhodey: We don’t have to do this, Tony.
Tony: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
Rhodey: Put it down!
Tony: You gonna take a shot?
Rhodey: Put it down!
Tony: No!
Rhodey: Drop it Tony!
Tony: Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony’s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE
MOJAVE, CA
Rhodey: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet… [Rhodey lands in suit.]
Major Allen: Colonel.
Rhodey: Major.
Major Allen: Wow.
Rhodey: Yeah. Let’s take it inside.
Major Allen: Clear the area.
[Scene change. Tony is sitting inside a doughnut, eating a doughnut. Pans out to see Nick Fury looking up at him.]
Nick Fury: Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
Tony: [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
Fury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?
Tony: It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
Fury: I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.
Tony: Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
Fury: That’s not looking so good.
Tony: I’ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can’t see her face.]
SHIELD agent: We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.
Tony: [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You’re fired.
Natalie: That’s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]
Fury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.
Tony: Hi.
Natalie/Agent Romanoff: I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.
Tony: I suggest you apologise.
Fury: You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…
Tony: You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
Fury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?
Agent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.
Tony: What do you want from me?
Fury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.
Tony: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?
Fury: What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.
Tony: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
Agent Romanoff: It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.
Fury: Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.
Tony: Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
Fury: Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all.
[Scene change. Hammer Industries]
Justin: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.
Ivan: This is not my bird.
Justin: What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.
Jack: It’s a beautiful bird.
Justin: We got this bird all the way from Russia.
Ivan: Hey, man, this is not my bird.
Justin: Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?
Jack: No.
Justin: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?
Ivan: Drone better.
Justin: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?
Ivan: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.
Justin: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.
Ivan: Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.
Justin: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.
[Scene change. Air base]
General: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?
Rhodey: Fully mission-capable.
General: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.
Rhodey: Sir?
General: Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.
Rhodey: Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…
General: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen.
Rhodey: Yes, General, but…
General: It’s also an order.
Rhodey: Yes sir.
General: Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud.
Rhodey: Thank you sir.
[Scene change. Tony’s house. It’s a bit broken. He is sitting with Nick Fury.]
Fury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
Tony: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…
Fury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.
Tony: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?
Fury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.
Tony: You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
Fury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
Tony: He said that?
Fury: Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.
Tony: I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.
Fury: What do you remember about your dad?
Tony: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
Fury: That’s not true.
Tony: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
Fury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.
Tony: What?
Fury: I got a two o’clock
Tony: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?
Fury: Okay, you’re good, right?
Tony: No, I’m not good.
Fury: You got this? Right? Right?
Tony: Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
Fury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?
Tony: Yeah.
Fury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]
Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha (We’ll stick with Natasha from now on): We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck. [She leaves]
Tony: [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.
Agent Coulson: I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?
Tony: I think I got it, yeah.
Agent Coulson: Enjoy your evening’s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]
[Scene change. Air base. Dismantling the suit]
Major Allen: Think this is the power source?
Rhodey: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?
Major Allen: Yes, sir.
Justin: [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?
Rhodey: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.
Justin: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…
Rhodey: That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.
Justin: Well, you’re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.
Rhodey: I think I’ll take it.
Justin: Which one?
Rhodey: All of it.
Justin: All of it.
[Scene change. Tony is looking through the box. Blue prints for the arc reactor. Newspaper articles. Video reels.]
Howard (on video): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I’m Howard Stark, and everything you’ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]
Man (out of sight): All right, I think we got…
Howard: I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and… [Video changes]
Man: Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]
Howard: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends.
Scene change. He’s driving down a road in car number plate Stark11
He stops to but some strawberries.]
Tony [Spanish]: How much?
Strawberry man: $6. Six.
Tony: I don’t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]
Strawberry man: No, sir, that’s too much.
Tony: No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine
Strawberry man: No, señor.
Tony: Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.
Strawberry man: Are you Iron Man?
Tony: Sometimes.
Strawberry man: [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!
[Now in Pepper’s office]
Pepper: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
PA: Miss Potts?
Tony: Relax.
PA: Mr Stark…
Tony: Is here.
PA: He refuses…
Tony: I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
Pepper (on phone): Listen, it’s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.
News reporter (on telly): When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.
Pepper: No, the suit belongs to us.
News reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.
Pepper: Yeah, but you’re not…
News reporter: He obviously did not.
Pepper: Burt…
News reporter: And now we learn that his secretary…
Pepper: Yes, it does.
News reporter: …a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?
Pepper: No.
News reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…
Tony: Mute.
Pepper: No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.
Tony: [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I’ll get this stuff out of here.
Pepper: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?
Tony: [Pulling up a chair] Will I?
Pepper: No, he will not. Bye.
Tony: I would like to be. Got a minute?
Pepper: No.
Tony: Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.
Pepper: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.
Tony: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.
Pepper: You didn’t come here to apologise?
Tony: Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…
Pepper: No.
Tony: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.
Pepper: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?
Tony: Yes.
Pepper: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?
Tony: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
Pepper: I need you…
Tony: I need you too.
Pepper: …to leave now
Tony: That’s what I’m trying to…
Natasha: [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?
Pepper: Hi, come on in.
Natasha: Wheels up in 25 minutes.
Pepper: Thank you.
Happy: Anything else, boss?
Tony: I’m good, Hap.
Pepper: No, I’ll be just another minute.
Tony: I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?
Pepper: No. That’s not so.
Tony: It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
Pepper: Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.
Natasha: Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
Tony: Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?
Natasha: [Latin]
Tony: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
Natasha: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]
Tony: You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
Scene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]
Tony: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.
Jarvis: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.
Tony: [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?
Jarvis: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?
Tony: That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
Jarvis: What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?
Tony: I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]
Jarvis: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
Tony: Thank Dad.
Jarvis: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.
Tony: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.
[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.
Agent Coulson enters]
Agent Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.
Tony: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?
Agent Coulson: I was doing some stuff.
Tony: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
Agent Coulson: [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What’s this doing here?
Tony: That’s it. Bring that to me.
Agent Coulson: You know what this is?
Tony: [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?
Agent Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
Tony: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
Agent Coulson: So I’m told.
Tony: Secret stuff?
Agent Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.
Tony: Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]
Agent Coulson: We need you.
Tony: Yeah, more than you know.
Agent Coulson: Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]
Jarvis: Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it’s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]
Tony: That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]
Jarvis: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.
[Scene change. Ivan is also building an arc reactor]
Justin (on phone from golf course): Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we’d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.
Ivan: The drone is not going to be ready.
Justin: Not ready? What do you mean?
Ivan: I can make presentation, not demonstration.
Justin: What the hell is the difference?
Ivan: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
Justin: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.
Ivan: I can make salute.
Justin: You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]
Ivan: Hey, man, everything will be okay.
Justin: This is not what I wanted.
[Justin is back at Hammer Industries. Enters Ivan’s room with two men.]
Justin: Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.
Ivan: [As man grabs bird] Hey!
Justin: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?
Ivan: [Russian] unintelligible
Justin: I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]
[Tony’s house]
Tony: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…
Jarvis: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.
Tony: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
Ivan: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.
Tony: You what?
Ivan: You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.
Tony: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
Ivan: You too.
Tony: [mutes his speaker] Trace him.
Jarvis: Sir.
Ivan: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.
Tony: Jarvis, where is he?
Jarvis: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.
Ivan: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.
Tony: Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
Jarvis: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
Ivan: I hope you’re ready. [Call ends]
Jarvis: Call trace incomplete.
[Sees advert for Justin’s presentation. Picks up new arc reactor]
Jarvis: Sir
Tony: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.
Jarvis: We are unclear as to the effects.
Tony: I don’t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!
[Stark Expo. Natasha opens the door for Pepper to exit the car]
Happy: I’ll keep the car down here, all right?
Pepper: Thank you Happy.
Announcer: …Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
[Begins. Justin dances on to the stage]
Justin: Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.
Pepper: Oh, Lord.
Justin: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.
Pepper: What? [Rises and salutes.]
Justin: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for… [incoming Iron Man]
Tony: We got trouble.
Rhodey: Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.
Tony: Give them a wave.
Justin: Hey, all right. Yeah.
Tony: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
Rhodey: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?
Tony: Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.
Rhodey: Vanko’s alive?
Justin: Yeah. [Tony approaches him]
Tony: What is he?
Justin: What?
Tony: Where’s Vanko?
Justin: Who?
Tony: Tell me.
Justin: What are you doing here man?
Rhodey: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tony: [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?
Rhodey: No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.
Tony: [Takes off] Let’s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]
Rhodey: No, no!
Tony: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
Jarvis: Yes sir.
Rhodey: Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.
Tony: On what?
Rhodey: On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!
Justin: [Running to a computer] What’s going on? What’s happening?
Technician: The software’s been overridden.
Justin: What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?
Technician: I think he slaved the drones.
Justin: That’s impossible. Call the guards.
Jack: All the phones are down sir.
Justin: Well, then call their… Call their cells.
Jack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.
Technician: He’s locked us out of the mainframe.
Pepper: [Entering] Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?
Justin: Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled.
Pepper: Have you now?
Justin: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?
Natasha: [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?
Justin: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
Natasha: Where is he?
Justin: At my facility. 
[Natasha lets go and leaves. Pepper dials a number on her phone]
Pepper: I need NYPD, please.
Justin: No, no, no!
Pepper: Command Central.
Justin: No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities.
Pepper: Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.
[Tony is still being chased by Rhodey’s suit and the air force drones]
Tony: How are we doing Jarvis?
Jarvis: Remote reboot unsuccessful.
[Other drones are now firing at the running crowds. Natasha leaves the building.]
Security guard: This way.
Happy: Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?
Natasha: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.
Happy: I’m not taking you anywhere.
Natasha: Fine. You want me to drive?
Happy: No, I’m driving. Get in the car.
[Lots of shooting drones and people screaming. The kid with the Iron Man helmet is targeted by a drone and holds his hand up. Tony lands behind him and shoots the drone with his hand repulsor]
Tony: Nice work kid. [Takes off again]
Rhodey: You got multiples coming in on you.
Tony: Let’s get this away from the Expo.
[Inside car]
Natasha: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She’s getting undressed in the back of the car] I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.
Happy: I got it. I got it.
[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.
Ivan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]
Rhodey: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.
Tony: Got it.
Rhodey: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.
[Hammer Industries. Happy parks the car outside. More of less]
Natasha: Stay in the car.
Happy: I’m not staying in the car.
Natasha: I said, stay in the car.
Happy: [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone.
Natasha: You want to help? Keep the car running.
Happy: [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.
[Ivan gets a security breach message]
Hammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here.
[Happy punches him and Natasha heads past.]
Second guard: Hold on. Hey!
[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.
Back at Expo]
Technician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.
Pepper: Well, choose one and focus on that.
Justin: Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?
[Hammer Industries. Happy is still fighting the same guard.]
Announcement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
Security guard: We got it. We’re on our way.
[And Natasha throws something. And takes on like five guards at once. She walks away, casually spraying one with pepper spray. All this while Happy’s fighting one guy. Happy wins.]
Happy: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done
Ivan gets up.
Tony is trying to let the drones away]
Tony: Rhodey, you still locked on?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
Rhodey: Wait, wait, wait!
[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.
Natasha kicks open Ivan’s door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]
Natasha: He’s gone.
[Tony and Rhodey]
Tony: I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome
Natasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]
Happy: What are you doing?
Natasha: I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.
[Rhodey is on top of Tony, who is pushing the gun to keep it from shooting him]
Rhodey: Tony.
[Natasha gains access.
Rhodey’s suit shuts down]
Natasha: Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.
Tony: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
Natasha: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.
Tony: Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.
Pepper: [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?
Tony: Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]
Pepper: What’s going on?
Tony: I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
Pepper: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
Tony: You didn’t let me.
Pepper: Why didn’t you tell me that?
Tony: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Natasha: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.
Tony: Great. Pepper?
Pepper: Are you okay now?
Tony: I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
Pepper: I am mad!
Tony: …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
Pepper: Fine.
Tony: We could have been in Venice.
Pepper: Oh please.
[Tony taps Rhodey’s helmet as the system restarts.]
Tony: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.
Rhodey: [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.
Tony: [Helps him up] You okay?
Rhodey: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?
Tony: Don’t be.
Rhodey: No. I should have trusted you more.
Tony: I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
Rhodey: No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.
Tony: Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?
Rhodey: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.
Tony: Got you. Where do you want to be?
Rhodey: Where are you going?
Tony: What’re you talking about?
Rhodey: I meant me.
Tony: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
Rhodey: Tony, don’t be jealous.
Tony: No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
Rhodey: Yeah. It’s called being a badass.
Tony: Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
Rhodey: Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
Tony: Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?
Rhodey: It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]
Tony: See that?
Rhodey: Yeah, yeah. Nice.
Tony: Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.] 
Rhodey: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
Tony: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
[Back inside Expo]
Justin: I told you that five minutes ago.
Pepper: [As police enter] That’s your guy here.
Justin: Excuse me?
Police officer: You’re being placed under arrest.
Justin: Are you kidding me?
Police officer: Hands behind your back sir.
Justin: I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon.
Pepper: [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.
Police officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
Pepper: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.
Police officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?
Pepper: No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear.
Police officer: Okay.
[Hammer Industries]
Natasha: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
Ivan: [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.
Rhodey: This ain’t gonna be good. [Ivan’s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
Tony: With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony: I got this. [Targets points on Ivan’s armour. Doesn’t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan’s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
Rhodey: What?
Tony: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
Rhodey: This is your idea?
Tony: Yep.
Rhodey: I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!
Tony: Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]
Ivan: You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]
Rhodey: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.
Tony: Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]
Pepper: Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.
Tony: You can’t?
Pepper: I can’t take this.
Tony: Look at me.
Pepper: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.
Tony: I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]
Pepper: I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.
Tony: What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.
Pepper: I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.
Tony: You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
Pepper: No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified.
Tony: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.
Pepper: Well…
Tony: You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?
Pepper: Thank you.
Tony: Yeah.
Pepper: Thank you for understanding.
Tony: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.
Pepper: I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.
Tony: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
Pepper: Well, with you it’s like dog years.
Tony: I know.
Pepper: I mean, it’s like the Presidency. [They kiss]
Tony: Weird.
Pepper: No, it’s not weird.
Tony: It’s okay, right?
Pepper: Yeah.
Tony: Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]
Rhodey: I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
Pepper: I had just quit, actually.
Tony: Yeah, so we’re not…
Rhodey: You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.
Tony: You should get lost.
Rhodey: I was here first. Get a roof.
Tony: I thought you were out of one-liners.
Rhodey: That’s the last one.
Tony: You kicked ass back there, by the way.
Rhodey: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?
Tony: Not okay. Not okay with that.
Rhodey: It wasn’t a question. [Takes off]
Tony: How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.
Picks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT
Nick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]
Fury: I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]
Tony: “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.
Fury: Read on.
Tony: “Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony’s chair]
Fury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]
Tony: [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury’s] You can’t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
Fury: I’ll see what I can do.
[Scene change. Washington. ACDC’s Highway To Hell Starts to play]
Stern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.
Rhodey: Thank you sir.
Stern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.



[Pose for a photo. Roll credits. Cue end credits scene. A car rolls up. Well-dressed shoes. Agent Coulson looks down on a crater. Takes off sunglasses and pulls out phone]
Agent Coulson: Sir, we’ve found it.

Transcript
(Shows the Iron Man suits getting destroyed.)
Tony Stark (V.O.): We create our own demons. Who said that? What does that even mean? Doesn't matter, I said it cause he said it. So now he was famous and that's basically get said by two well known guys. I don't, uh... (Sighs)
(Screen goes black.)
Tony Stark (V.O.): I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.
(Effel 65's ""I'm Blue"" playing over the MARVEL logo.)
(1999, Bern, Switzerland, New Years Eve Party.)
Happy Hogan: (to Maya.) Half hour till the ball drops.
Tony Stark: Hey, do you want...?
Party Guest: Tony Stark? Great speech, man!
(Hogan moves the man away from Tony.)
Happy Hogan: I got you, pal.
Tony Stark: I gave a speech? How was it?
Happy Hogan: Pitiful
Maya Hansen: Unintelligible.
Tony Stark: Really?
Maya Hansen: Mmm-hmm.
Tony Stark: It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.
(They start walking together.)
Maya Hansen: Where are we going?
Tony Stark: Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.
Maya Hansen: Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my ""town.""
Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark 
(As Tony & Maya are walking away the man intercepts them.) Ho Yinsen.
Tony Stark: Oh, I finally met a man called ""Ho.""
(Tony & Yinsen shake hands. While, Yinsen chuckles humorlessly; Tony turns to Maya.) Come here.
Ho Yinsen: I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu. 
(Yinsen moves them towards Wu.)
Tony Stark: [to Wu] Oh, this guy.
Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: Hey. (Dr. Wu greets Tony in mandarin as they shake hands.) You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I... (Tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn & walks away with Maya.)
Maya Hansen: Bye.
Ho Yinsen: Perhaps another time.
Tony Stark (V.O.):  It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999.
(People yelling indistinctly.) The old days.
Aldrich Killian: Mr. Stark!
Tony Stark (V.O.): I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they?
[As Tony and Maya walk towards the elevator an enthusiastic man with long hair comes up towards them]
Aldrich Killian: Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian. (Stuttering To Maya) I'm a big fan of your work!
Maya Hansen: My work?
Tony Stark: Who isn't? He means me.
Aldrich Killian: Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT.
[Tony, Maya and Hogan walk into the elevator]
Happy Hogan: Yeah, we're full.
[Hogan puts his arms out to stop Aldrich from coming inside, but he ducks under Hogan's arms and moves into the elevator]
Tony Stark: Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.
[Hogan traps Aldrich by the wall]
Happy Hogan: What floor are you going to, pal?
Aldrich Killian: Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics. [He holds out two business cards towards Tony and Maya]
Tony Stark: Uh... she'll take both.
Maya Hansen: Okay. [takes the cards]
Tony Stark: One to throw away and one to not call.
Aldrich Killian: Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. (Points to the logo on his shirt) Do you get it?
Tony Stark: I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.
Aldrich Killian: Aw!
Tony Stark: (to the party of women in the elevator; referring to Hogan as they walk out) Ladies, follow the mullet.(To Maya) Ladies first.
Maya Hansen: (to Aldrich as she walks out of the elevator) Thank you, I'll call you.
[as everyone walks out of the elevator, Tony stops Aldrich from getting out by putting out his arm in front of him]
Tony Stark: I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
Aldrich Killian: Yeah?
Tony Stark: Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. [steps out of the elevator] I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Aldrich Killian: I'll see you up there.
[the elevator door closes]
Tony Stark: Damn betcha.
[Scene change to Maya's room}
Tony Stark: Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
Maya Hansen: Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...
[we see they are looking at a computer monitor with graph of the brain]
Tony Stark: Wow.
Maya Hansen: ...And chemically recode it.
Tony Stark: That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...
Both: ...Genetic operating system...
Tony Stark: ...of a...
Maya Hansen: Exactly.
Tony: ...living organism.
Maya Hansen: Yes.
Tony Stark: Wow.
[Hogan touches Maya's plant]
Maya Hansen: Is that... Can you...
Happy Hogan: What?
Maya Hansen: Can you not touch my plant. It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...
Tony Stark: She's not like the others.​​​​​​ (to Maya) Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...
Maya Hansen: That's cute, but...
Tony Stark: Leave her ficus alone.
Maya Hansen: [turns to Hogan] Because... and, no, seriously don't. [walks into the bedroom]
Tony Stark: And you're starting with plants?
Maya Hansen: For now, yeah.
Tony Stark: Huh.
Maya Hansen: I'm calling it Extremis.
[Happy reaches for the plant and pulls off some leaves to just throw them on the ground.]
[Tony and Maya continue talking about her research in the bedroom]
Maya Hansen: Well, it's...
Both: Human application.
Maya Hansen: Exactly! Exactly.
[Zooms in on the plant and it's growing a new ""Limb""]
Maya Hansen: Dendritic revitalization.
Tony Stark: It's revolutionary.
Maya Hansen: Disease prevention...
Tony Stark: Changes the world.
Maya Hansen: ...even limb regrowth.
[Goes back to Maya and Tony]
Tony Stark: You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
Maya Hansen: Wow.
Tony Stark: In Switzerland.
Maya Hansen: Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.
Tony: This week.
[Maya takes off Tony's glasses, Tony laughs]
Tony Stark: You almost bought it, didn't you?
[Maya puts on the glasses and Happy shuts the door. He nods and they start kissing to be interrupted by an explosion and glass shattering.]
Maya Hansen: This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
Tony Stark: Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
Maya Hansen: The what?
[at that moment Hogan runs into the room and tackles Tony onto the bed to make sure he's okay]
Happy Hogan: Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.
Tony Stark: We're good.
Happy Hogan: Stay down.
Tony Stark: You're...you're right on me. I made it. (Happy gets up) What the hell was that?
[People counting down outside.]
Happy Hogan: What was that?
Maya Hansen: It's a glitch in my work. It's...
Tony Stark: She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.
Happy Hogan: It's not Y2K.
Maya Hansen: No.
[Tony hears people celebrating outside]
Tony Stark: Hey!
Happy Hogan: Happy New Year.
Tony Stark: Happy New Year.
Maya Hansen: Happy New Year.
Tony Stark: Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.
[Tony shakes hands with Hogan]
Happy Hogan: You good?
Tony Stark: Yep.
Happy Hogan: I'll be right outside.
Tony Stark: Okay.
[Hogan leaves the room; we then see Aldrich on top of the building waiting for Tony, who never shows]
Tony Stark: [voice over] So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.
[we see Tony writing a note 'You know who I am', and leaving it on the bedside table for Maya before leaving; Maya hears the door close]
Tony Stark: [voice over] Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.
[Present Day, Malibu, California - Tony is in his lab injecting himself with some devices]
Tony Stark: Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...
Tony Stark: No. Forty-eight. [he injects himself] Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
JARVIS: As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.
Tony Stark: Which I will. Right, let's do this.
[to the robot that's using a broom to clear the rubbish off the floor]
Tony Stark: Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.
[Tony walks towards the robot]
Tony Stark: Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.
JARVIS: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.
[addressing the Iron Man suits that are in their glass cages]
Tony Stark: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.
[to Jarvis as he records Tony with a camera]
Tony Stark: Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.
[Tony raises his hands and motions to activate the new suit]
Tony Stark: Jarvis, drop my needle.
[music starts playing, Tony moves with the music then points his arm where he'd been injecting himself toward the dismantled Iron Man suit on the table opposite, nothing happens]
Tony Stark: Crap.
[Tony bites his arm where he'd injected himself once and then hits it five times, he points his arm again and this time a part of the suit flies over to Tony and attaches itself to his hand and extends to his arm and shoulder, Tony then points his other arm toward the suit and the second part attaches itself to his hand and arm, Tony laughs]
Tony Stark: Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all.
[the leg part flies over and attaches itself to Tony's leg, then as another part flies over it crashes into one of the Iron Man suit glass cages, then another part hurls itself at Tony and Tony inflects it with his arm making it crash]
Tony Stark: Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...
[suddenly another part of the suit shoots over and Tony ducks as it narrowly misses hitting him in the head]
Tony Stark: ...little bit.
[the other parts fly over and attach themselves with force to Tony's back and crotch area]
Tony Stark: Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
[then all the other parts shoot over and get attached to Tony, accept for the final face piece, which just hovers, facing Tony]
Tony Stark: Come on. I ain't scared of you.
[the face piece flies over and Tony flips over to grab the piece and finally the Iron Man suit is fully attached to Tony]
Tony Stark: I'm the best.
[at that moment, one of the stray pieces of the suit shoot over to Tony, knock hims down, which knocks the entire suit, except for the head piece, off Tony]
JARVIS: As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.
Tony Stark: [voice over] And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
[the news on TV shows footage of The Mandarin]
Tony Stark: [voice over] That's when he happened.
The Mandarin: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.
[as this footage ends, the TV channels change and all the news channels are talking about The Mandarin]
[the news on TV shows President Ellis addresses The Mandarin Threat]
News Reporter #1: And now that we seem to be back, let's recap some of the frightening...
News Reporter #2: American Airwaves were highjacked...
News Reporter #3: The nation remains on high alert...
News Reporter #4: All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful...
President Ellis: Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot.
[we then see Bill Maher talking about this on his show]
Bill Maher: And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.
[then we see Joan Rivers on 'The Fashion Police' talking about the new Iron Man suit]
Joan Rivers: Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.
[Rhodes and Tony Stark are at a bar and they see Joan Rivers making fun of the Iron Patriot suit on TV]
Colonel James Rhodes: It tested well with focus groups, alright?
Tony Stark: [putting on a mocking voice] I am Iron Patriot...
Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.
Tony Stark: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
[Tony moves closer to Rhodes]
Colonel James Rhodes: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.
Tony Stark: Nine.
Colonel James Rhodes: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.
Tony Stark: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.
Colonel James Rhodes: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
Tony Stark: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
Colonel James Rhodes: People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.
Tony Stark: You're gonna come at me like that?
Colonel James Rhodes: No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...
[a girl and a boy come up to their table]
Colonel James Rhodes: ...tator.
Erin: Do you mind signing my drawing?
Tony Stark: If Richard doesn't mind. [to Rhodes] You alright with this, Dick?
Colonel James Rhodes: Fine with me.
[Tony looks at the drawing of himself in his Iron Man suit that the girl has drawn]
Tony Stark: [To the girl] What's your name?
Erin: Erin.
[Tony looks at the boy standing next to him]
Tony Stark: I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.
[as Tony is signing Erin's drawing]
Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...
Tony Stark: It's not superhero business, I get it.
Colonel James Rhodes: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.
Tony Stark: That's why I said I...got it.
[suddenly as Tony is signing the drawing he looks ill, he places his hand on his face]
Colonel James Rhodes: Are you okay?
Tony Stark: I broke the crayon.
Erin: Are you okay, Mr. Stark?
Colonel James Rhodes: Take it easy. Tony...
Little Boy: [the little boy whispers to Tony] How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?
[suddenly Tony rises and starts walking off]
Colonel James Rhodes: Wait a minute! Tony!
[Rhodes follows Tony as he walks out the bar]
Tony Stark: What'd he say?!
Colonel James Rhodes: Tony!
Tony Stark: Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
[Tony steps into his Iron Man suit that was parked outside the bar and collapses to his knees]
Tony Stark: Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.
Tony Stark: Okay, so I was poisoned?
Jarvis: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
Tony Stark: Me?
[Rhodes knocks on the Iron Suit's head, people have gathered around them watching Tony]
Colonel James Rhodes: Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.
Tony Stark: Sorry, I gotta split.
[Tony flies off in his suit]
[at Stark Industries Hogan points to his badge as walks through the lobby passing the other employees]
Happy Hogan: Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to Tony's robots as Hogan meets with Pepper] Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use.
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?
Happy Hogan: What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.
Pepper Potts: What!?
Happy Hogan: [to another employee as Hogan walks past them] Excuse me, Bambi.
Pepper Potts: [Hogan points to his badge] Did you just say that?
Happy Hogan: Security.
Pepper Potts: Happy?
Happy Hogan: Yes.
Pepper Potts: Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you.
Happy Hogan: Thank you.
Pepper Potts: However...
Happy Hogan: I do appreciate it
Pepper Potts: Since you've taken the post...
Happy Hogan: You don't have to thank me.
Pepper Potts: We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent
Happy Hogan: Thank you.
Pepper Potts: That's not a compliment.
Happy Hogan: That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.
Pepper Potts: I...
Pepper's Assistant: Excuse me.
Pepper Potts: Yes?
Pepper's Assistant: Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.
Pepper Potts: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: Did you clear this four o'clock with me?
Pepper Potts: Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.
[Pepper starts walking towards her office]
Happy Hogan: How so?
Pepper Potts: I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward.
[Hogan opens her office glass door and they enter]
Happy Hogan: I don't like the sound of that.
[as they step inside, they see Aldrich, looking handsome and fit in a business suit]
[Pepper looks shocked at the change in Aldrich's appearance]
Aldrich Killian: Pepper.
Pepper Potts: Killian?
Aldrich Killian: You look great. You look really great.
Pepper Potts: God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?
Aldrich Killian: Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich.
Happy Hogan: Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
Pepper Potts: Happy, it's okay.
Happy Hogan: Yes?
Pepper Potts: We're good.
Happy Hogan: You sure?
Pepper Potts: Yes. Stand down.
Happy Hogan: Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here.
Pepper Potts: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: Okay.
[Hogan steps out of Pepper's office and closes the glass door]
Pepper Potts: It's very nice to see you, Killian.
[as Hogan waits outside Pepper's office, he sees Aldrich's man sitting in the waiting area]
Happy Hogan: Hey, guy.
[Hogan points to his security badge and the guy picks up his badge from the table next to him and holds it up to show Hogan he has a badge; to an employee as they walk past him]
Savin: Merry Christmas.
[Hogan looks at him with suspicion]
[back in Pepper's office]
Aldrich Killian: After years dodging the President's ban on ""immoral biotech research"", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down.
[he dims the lights then holds in his hand three small metal balls]
Aldrich Killian: Regard the human brain.
[he throws the balls onto the coffee table and as they roll and stop, they project a 3d image into the room]
Aldrich Killian: Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...
[he presses his projector control which changes the 3d image to show inside of the brain]
Aldrich Killian: That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?
Pepper Potts Wow, that's amazing!
Aldrich Killian: Thanks, it's mine.
Pepper Potts: What?
Aldrich Killian: This...you're inside my head. It's a...
[he taps behind his ear, referring to something embedded inside his head]
Aldrich Killian: It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
[Aldrich rises from the couch and stands on the coffee table]
Aldrich Killian: Come on.
[he helps Pepper to stand on the coffee table next to him, they stand directly in the 3d image]
Aldrich Killian: Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.
[Pepper pinches him and immediately something lights up in the 3d image of Aldrich's brain]
Pepper Potts: What is that?
Aldrich Killian: It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.
[he turns Pepper round and presses his projector control and starts changing and moving the image with his hand]
Aldrich Killian: Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded.
Pepper Potts: Wow.
[as Hogan sits outside Pepper's office, he gets a call on his tablet, he answers the call and holds the tablet high so the camera monitor shows his forehead and eyes]
Happy Hogan: Hello?
Tony Stark: Is this forehead of Security?
Happy Hogan: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.
[we see Tony is in his lab]
Tony Stark: What? Harassing interns?
Happy Hogan: Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face.
[Tony laughs]
Happy Hogan: I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.
Tony Stark: What's going on? Fill me in.
Happy Hogan: For real?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.
Tony Stark: Right.
Happy Hogan: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.
Tony Stark: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.
Happy Hogan: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?
Tony Stark: Um...Switzerland.
Happy Hogan: Right, right, exactly.
Tony Stark: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.
Happy Hogan: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.
Tony Stark: His what?
Happy Hogan: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards Pepper's glass office, where Aldrich and Pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all Tony sees is Hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]
Tony Stark: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
Happy Hogan: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.
Tony Stark: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.
Happy Hogan: I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.
[as Hogan is talking, Tony uses his small tablet device to look up Aldrich and finds his photo]
Happy Hogan: Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.
Tony Stark: Relax.
Happy Hogan: Seriously?
Tony Stark: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
Happy Hogan: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.
Tony Stark: A giant brain?
Happy Hogan: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.
Tony Stark: I miss you, Happy.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...
Tony Stark: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?
Happy Hogan: Why?
Tony Stark: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.
[he puts his small tablet in his wine fridge and closes it and walks off still with Hogan online]
Happy Hogan: Yeah, nice.
[back in Pepper's office after Aldrich has show her his new research]
Aldrich Killian: Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.
Pepper Potts: It would be incredible.
Aldrich Killian: Mm.
Pepper Potts: Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...
Aldrich Killian: Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.
Pepper Potts: It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.
[we see Aldrich leaving the building]
Aldrich Killian: Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'
Pepper Potts: That's very deep.
Aldrich Killian: Mm
Pepper Potts: And I have no idea what it means.
Aldrich Killian: Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
[Pepper laughs]
Aldrich Killian: I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
[Aldrich kisses her gently on the cheek and Pepper watches him as he walks off, then Pepper notices Hogan coming toward her, Pepper looks flustered]
Pepper Potts: Happy...
Happy Hogan: The car is ready, if you're ready to go.
[Pepper glances over to Aldrich as he walks towards his car]
Pepper Potts: Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna...
[she walks back into the building, Hogan glance over to Aldrich's car and as it drives away, Hogan takes a photo of the license plate]
[later Pepper returns to Tony's home, as she gets out of the car she sees a large stuffed rabbit outside the house that Tony has bought for her as a gift, she walks inside]
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!
[she notices Tony sat in his Iron Man suit on the couch]
Pepper Potts: You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?
[Tony looks at the small number marked 42 on the suit]
Tony Stark: Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
Pepper Potts: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?
[Tony rises and walks toward her]
Tony Stark: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.
[Tony shakes his ass and Pepper laughs]
Tony Stark: Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?
Pepper Potts: Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?
Tony Stark: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.
Pepper Potts: Okay.
Tony Stark: So, uh...tense? Good day?
[Tony walks up behind her and starts massaging her shoulders]
Tony Stark: Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
Pepper Potts: Did I like it?
Tony Stark: Nailed it, right?
Pepper Potts: Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.
[Pepper turns to face Tony, she rises from her seat and stands close to him]
Pepper Potts: So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
[Tony knocks the metal helmet on his head]
Tony Stark: Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.
Tony Stark: The facial slit?
Pepper Potts: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?
Tony Stark: Crowbar. Yeah.
[Pepper starts walking towards Tony's lab]
Tony Stark: Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.
Pepper Potts: I'll take my chances.
Tony Stark: That's risky.
[Pepper walks down the stairs to Tony's lab]
Tony Stark: At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.
[Pepper sees Tony is in fact not in his Iron Man suit, but in the lab exercising as he remotely controls the suit, which follows Pepper into the lab]
Tony Stark: Busted.
Pepper Potts: This is a new level of lame.
Tony Stark: Sorry.
[Pepper notices the food tray in the corner]
Pepper Potts: You ate without me, already? On date night?
Tony Stark: [referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...
Pepper Potts: You mean you?
Tony Stark: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.
Tony Stark: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
[Mark 42 suit turns its face toward her, as if to look at her accusingly]
Pepper Potts: What?
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper Potts: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?
Tony Stark: Happy was concerned.
Pepper Potts: No, you're spying on me.
Tony Stark: I wasn't...
Pepper Potts: I'm going to bed.
[Pepper turns and starts walking off]
Tony Stark: Hold on. Come on. Pep.
[as Pepper starts walking upstairs]
Tony Stark: Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.
[Pepper stops and looks at him]
Tony Stark: I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.
[Pepper walks back down]
Tony Stark: Nothing's been the same since New York.
Pepper Potts: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.
Tony Stark: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.
[he pauses for a moment and sits down]
Tony Stark: But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...
Pepper Potts: Machines.
Tony Stark: They're part of me.
Pepper Potts: A distraction.
Tony Stark: Maybe.
[Pepper walks towards Tony and they hold each other. He rests his head against her chest and she removes his headband that controls the Iron Man suits]
Pepper Potts: I'm gonna take a shower.
Tony Stark: Okay.
[Pepper turns to walk off, then stops and looks at him]
Pepper Potts: And you're gonna join me.
Tony Stark: Better.
[later that night, as Tony and Pepper are sleeping, Tony starts having nightmares about when he was in New York with The Avengers and had to get rid of the nuke in space, Pepper wakes and starts to shake Tony awake]
Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...
[suddenly Pepper gets grabbed and shoved off Tony by Mark 42 suit, this wakes Tony who commands the suit]
Tony Stark: Power down!
[the suit shuts down and Tony hits it making its pieces fall apart, he looks over at Pepper who is in shock]
Tony Stark: I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?
[Pepper rises and starts to leave]
Tony Stark: Don't go, alright? Pepper?
Pepper Potts: I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.
[Pepper leaves the room]
[at the Chinese theater in Los Angeles, we see Aldrich's henchman meet a man who's sat outside the theater]
Savin: Can you regulate?
Taggert: Yes, I can regulate.
Savin: Are you sure about that?
Taggert: Yes.
[Hogan who's been following Savin, keeps an eye on him from a distance, he sees Savin giving the man a briefcase]
Savin: It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.
Taggert: Thank you...I mean for understanding.
[Savin walks off, Hogan walks towards Taggert and as Taggert rises to leave Hogan bumps into him which knock the briefcase out of Taggert's hand, falling open on to the ground]
Happy Hogan: I'm sorry, buddy.
[Hogan helps him put the stuff back in the suitcase, and as he looks at Taggert he notices that he is glowing red, Hogan starts to walk off taking one of the items from the suitcase, but suddenly Savin bumps into him]
Savin: What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?
Happy Hogan: Yeah, a little movie called ""The Party's Over"", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]
Savin: No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face twice, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]
Taggert: Savin!
Savin: What?
Taggert: Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened]
[we see another TV footage from The Mandarin]
The Mandarin: True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation.
[as Hogan lies in hospital critically injured, Tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on Hogan]
Tony Stark: Hi.
Happy's Nurse: Oh.
Tony Stark: [referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?
Happy's Nurse: Sure. [Tony rises from his seat]
Tony Stark: Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave]
[news reporters are all waiting for Tony outside the hospital]
Hospital News Reporter: We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]
Pushy Tabloid Reporter: Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]
Tony Stark: Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided [He removes his sunglasses and stares into the phone's camera] that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] That's what you wanted, right? [He takes the phone and throws it at a wall] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off]
[as Tony is working his lab]
JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]
Tony Stark: Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning ""adviser to the King"". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]
JARVIS: The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.
Tony Stark: No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.
JARVIS: No, sir.
Tony Stark: Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?
JARVIS: Not according to public records, sir.
Tony Stark: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.
JARVIS: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.
Tony Stark: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?
JARVIS: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
Tony Stark: Bring her around.
JARVIS: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack]
Tony Stark: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?
JARVIS: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]
Tony Stark: Are we still at ""ding-dong""? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?
JARVIS: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]
Tony Stark: Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?
Maya Hansen: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?
Tony Stark: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
Tony Stark: That's right.
Maya Hansen: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.
Tony Stark: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her.
Pepper Potts: Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]
Tony Stark: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. [Maya smiles] Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.
Maya Hansen: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.
Tony Stark: What...what for? Why now?
Maya Hansen: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.
Tony Stark: I'll be fine.
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.
Tony Stark: We weren't.
Maya Hansen: No, I...
Pepper Potts: And old girlfriends!
Tony Stark: She's not really.
Maya Hansen: No, not really. It...it was just one night.
Tony Stark: Yep.
Pepper Potts: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.
Tony Stark: It was a great night.
Pepper Potts: Well, you know...
Maya Hansen: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: You have saved yourself a world of pain.
Maya Hansen: I'm sure.
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper Potts: Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.
Tony Stark: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
Pepper Potts: Yep!
Tony Stark: The man says no.
Pepper Potts: Immediately and indefinitely!
Tony Stark: Honey...
Maya Hansen: Great idea. Let's go.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
Pepper Potts: Tony, this is how normal people behave.
Tony Stark: I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper]
Maya Hansen: Is...is that normal?
Tony Stark: Yes, this is normal!
Pepper Potts: Sadly, that...is very normal.
Tony Stark: It's a big bunny, relax about it!
Pepper Potts: Calm down!
Tony Stark: I got this for you.
Pepper Potts: I'm aware of that.
Tony Stark: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
Pepper Potts: I don't like it!
Tony Stark: I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]
Pepper Potts: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.
Tony Stark: I said no.
Maya Hansen: Guys, can we um...
Tony Stark: What?
Maya Hansen: [she points to the bomb heading straight for the house] Do we need to worry about that? [The house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit]
Pepper Potts: I got you.
Tony Stark: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor between Pepper and Tony collapses] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]
Pepper Potts: Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony]
JARVIS: Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]
Tony Stark: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!
JARVIS: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to fire a piano at a helicopter to destroy it]
Tony Stark: That's one.
JARVIS: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]
Tony Stark: That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean. In the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]
Pepper Potts: Tony!
JARVIS: Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean.]
[The screen goes black]
JARVIS: Sir. Sir!
Tony Stark: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.
JARVIS: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]
Tony Stark: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?
JARVIS: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.
Tony Stark: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...
JARVIS: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.
Tony Stark: Who asked you? Open the suit.
JARVIS: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.
Tony Stark: Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather.] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
JARVIS: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]
Tony Stark: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]
Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.
Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm, a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]
Harley Keener: Freeze! Don't move.
Tony Stark: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo.
Harley Keener: What's that thing on your chest?
Tony Stark: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.
Harley Keener: What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?
Tony Stark: Technically, I am.
Harley Keener: Technically, you're dead. [he give Tony a newspaper which has Tony's picture with the headline 'Mandarin Attack: Stark presumed dead']
Tony Stark: A valid point.
Harley Keener: [referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?
Tony Stark: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.
Harley Keener: Like a mechanic?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Harley Keener: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.
Tony Stark: [Interupting Harley] It's Iron Patriot now.
Harley Keener: That's way cooler!
Tony Stark: No, it's not.
Harley Keener: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...
Tony Stark: Retroreflective panels?
Harley Keener: To make him stealth mode.
Tony Stark: You want a stealth mode?
Harley Keener: Cool, right?
Tony Stark: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
Harley Keener: [as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!
Tony Stark: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.
Harley Keener: S...Sorry.
Tony Stark: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?
Harley Keener: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.
Tony Stark: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.
Harley Keener: What's in it for me?
Tony Stark: Salvation. What's his name?
Harley Keener: Who?
Tony Stark: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?
Harley Keener: How'd you know that?
Tony Stark: I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?
Harley Keener: Deal.
Tony Stark: Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?
Harley Keener: Harley. And you're...
Tony Stark: The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? [back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks out across the ocean. She sees one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets and pulls it towards her, her forehead resting against the helmet's. She sees a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier]
Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.
Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. [Pepper gasps and smiles] I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.
[later that night as Pepper drives Maya home]
Pepper Potts: Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
Maya Hansen: [A beat] I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.
Pepper Potts: Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...
Maya Hansen: That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.
Pepper Potts: This boss of yours, does he have a name?
Maya Hansen: Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock]
[we see Aldrich talking on the phone to Savin]
Savin: Well, we took the house down, sir...
Aldrich Killian: Mmhmm.
Savin: But there's no sign of a body.
Aldrich Killian: I see.
Savin: No Stark.
Aldrich Killian: I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face.
[we then see the Mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]
Mandarin Look-Out: The Master is travelling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]
The Mandarin: Well then. What are we waiting for?
[in Rose Hills, Tennessee, Tony and Harley walk in town at night]
Tony Stark: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]
Harley Keener: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?
Tony Stark: Maybe never, relax about it.
Harley Keener: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?
Tony Stark: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?
Harley Keener: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]
Tony Stark: Six people died, right?
Harley Keener: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Including Chad Davis?
Harley Keener: Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]
Tony Stark: Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.
Harley Keener: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.
Tony Stark: Do you buy that?
Harley Keener: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?
Tony Stark: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
Harley Keener: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?
Tony Stark: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
Harley Keener: Are they coming back? The aliens?
Tony Stark: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
Harley Keener: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?
Tony Stark: Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
Harley Keener: Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?
Tony Stark: Nope.
Harley Keener: Do you need to be on it?
Tony Stark: Probably.
Harley Keener: Do you have PTSD?
Tony Stark: I don't think so.
Harley Keener: Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?
Tony Stark: Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! [Tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?
Harley Keener: What did I say? [Tony starts running off and Harley runs after him] Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. [Tony stops running and Harley catches up with him] What the hell was that? [Tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at Harley]
Tony Stark: Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?
Harley Keener: Where she always is.
Tony Stark: See, now you're being helpful. [later we see Tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] Sorry. [the woman drops something] Lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]
Brandt: Thank you. [Tony notices the woman has burn marks on one side of her face]
Tony Stark: Nice haircut, suits you.
Brandt: Nice watch.
Tony Stark: Yeah, limited edition.
Brandt: Oh, I don't doubt it. [there's a moment's pause] Well, have a good evening. [the woman turns and walks off] [Tony enters the bar and walks up to Mrs. Davis, who's sat at table drinking alone]
Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?
Mrs. Davis: Free country.
Tony Stark: It sure is. [Tony sits next to her, Mrs. Davis looks at Tony for a moment]
Mrs. Davis: Alright. Where'd you like to start?
Tony Stark: I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
Mrs. Davis: Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [Tony opens the file]
Tony Stark: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?
Mrs. Davis: Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad]
Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.
Mrs. Davis: What?
Tony Stark: As a weapon.
Mrs. Davis: You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]
Brandt: Actually, I am. [Tony looks up and it's the woman he bumped into outsid the bar] [suddenly Brandt grabs hold of Tony's arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, Tony manages to quickly grab hold of Chad's dog tags that were on the table]
Rose Hills Sheriff: Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?
Brandt: It's called an arrest. [she pushes Tony to the ground and steps towards the Sheriff] Sheriff, is it?
Rose Hills Sheriff: Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?
Brandt: Homeland Security. [she holds up her badge] We good here?
Rose Hills Sheriff: No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.
Brandt: Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.
Rose Hills Sheriff: Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me? [Tony gestures to Mrs. Davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]
Brandt: Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good. [Tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]
Rose Hills Sheriff: Deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly Brandt shoves the hot badge into the Sheriff's face, she takes his gun and shoots him, Tony runs out of the bar and Brandt follows him, he turns to her]
Tony Stark: Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. [as Tony turns to run again he sees Savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as Savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, Tony runs off and Harley throws something at Savin to make him miss Tony, Tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] Crazy, huh?
Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Watch this. [Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]
Brandt: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
Tony Stark: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony stumbles out of the shop as people run past. A watertank falls down and traps Tony's leg. He finds that Savin has grabbed Harley]
Harley Keener: Let me go! [Savin mocks Harley]
Savin: Help me! Help me! [as Tony's leg is trapped under some rubble, Savin sits in front of him with Harley sat on his lap] Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?
Harley Keener: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!
Savin: Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, ""I want my god damn file.""
Tony Stark: It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. [Harley uses the gadget Tony gave him earlier and runs away] Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. [Tony brings up his hand and reveals his Iron Man suit hand. He fires at Savin and sends him flying backwards. Tony makes his way out of the rubble before leaving.]
Harley Keener: You're welcome
Tony Stark: For what? Did I miss something?
Harley Keener: Me saving your life
Tony Stark: Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.
Harley Keener: Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.
Tony Stark: What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. [Tony gets in his car] I'm sorry, kid, you did good.
Harley Keener: So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?
Tony Stark: Yep [A beat] Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?
Harley Keener: [Childishly] I'm cold.
Tony Stark: [Mocking him] I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. [Tony drives away]
Harley Keener: It was worth a shot.
[Savin wakes up, coughing and healed from Extremis. His face glows red.] [During an advert, the Mandarin takes over the satellite.]
Government Employee: Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.
Vice President: Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?
[On a plane, the President looks at a TV is shock.]
The Mandarin: Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards. [The screen zooms out to show a man lying on the floor while Mandarin points a gun at him] Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation. [Thomas sobs] But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.
Thomas Richards: No!
The Mandarin: The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!
Government Official #1: How did he hack my phone?
Government Official #2: We can't allow terrorists to dictate...
President Ellis: I have to make this call.
Government Official #2: I'd strongly advise against that.
President Ellis: This is the right thing to do. [The phone rings but Mandarin doesn't answer. He waits for a few seconds before firing the gun.]
The Mandarin: There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon.
President Ellis: Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.
Military Aide: Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.
President Ellis: Right now.
Military Aide: Yes, sir.
(Tony Stark is reading over some files in a car. He sighs.)
Tony Stark: Man. Happy, Happy, Happy- 
(Rhodey, suited in his Iron Patriot armor, kicks down a door & marches forwards.)
Rhodey: Don't move! (His phone rings.) Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?
Tony Stark: You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?
Rhodey: Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
Tony Stark: It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?
Rhodey: A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?
Tony Stark: Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.
Rhodey: It's the same as it's always been, ""WarMachine68.""
Tony Stark: And password, please.
Rhodey: Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.
Tony Stark: It's not the '80s, nobody says ""hack"" any more. Give me your login. (Rhodey sighs.)
Rhodey: ""WAR MACHINE ROX"" with an ""X,"" all caps.
Tony Stark: (He's laughing.) That is so much better than ""lron Patriot.""
EMCEE: Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?
Elk Ridge: Well, David...
Crew: Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...
EMCEE: One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.
Cameraman: Because you erase my shows!
Tony Stark: That ain't gonna cut it.
Cameraman: We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who... (Tony turns around.)
Tony Stark: Shh.
Cameraman: Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.
Tony Stark: Shh. Keep it down.
Cameraman: Tony Stark is in my van!
Tony Stark: No, he's not.
Cameraman: I knew you were still alive! 
Tony Stark: Come on in. Close the door. (The cameraman gets in the van & closes the door.) Shh...
Cameraman: Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...
Tony Stark: Yep.
Cameraman: I am your biggest fan.
Tony Stark: Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?
Cameraman: No, no, no. Just us.
Tony Stark: Great. What's your name?
Cameraman: Gary
Tony Stark: Gary?
Gary: Oh, wow.
Tony Stark: Right there is fine.
Gary: Okay. 
Tony Stark: Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.
Gary: Oh, good. Can I just say?
Tony Stark: What do you want?
Gary: Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...
Tony Stark: It's fine.
Gary: It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.
Tony Stark: Right.
Gary: I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!
Tony Stark: A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me? 
Gary: Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...
Tony Stark: Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.
Gary: Got it.
Tony Stark: All right? It's a mission.
Gary: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Tony needs Gary.
Gary: And Gary needs Tony.
Tony Stark: Be quiet about it. Go.
Gary: Yeah. 
(Tony types on the keyboard & accesses the files he needs. A video starts playing.)
Aldrich Killian: What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?
Chad Davis: Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me. (Tony types again and another video shows up.)
Aldrich Killian: Will you please state your name for the camera?
Brandt: Ellen Brandt.
Aldrich Killian: Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. (More typing, another video.) Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. (Brandt's missing arm grows back as she glows red. The other volunteers glow red & scream too.) We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here! (One of the volunteers exploads.)
Tony Stark: (He's muttering.) A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.
(Pepper and Maya are in a bedroom talking.)
Maya Hansen: What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ""The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet."" See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.
Pepper Potts: You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.
Maya Hansen: Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.
Pepper Potts: That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.
Maya Hansen: Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. (Someone knocks on the door & Pepper looks over. She gets up & opens the door. Room service pushes in a tray of food but Killain appears & snaps his neck. Pepper gasps.)
Pepper Potts: Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck.
Aldrich Killian: Hi, Pepper. (To Maya) So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?
Maya Hansen: I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
Aldrich Killian: Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?
Maya Hansen: I've told you, Killian, we can use him.
Aldrich Killian: Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Maya Hansen: Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.
[Rhodey flies across the sky in his Iron Patriot armor.]
Man: [On radio] This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
Rhodey: Copy. [Repulsor firing, people shrieking] Nobody move. [Women exclaiming in fear] Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure. [One of the women shakes Rhodey's hand and her hand glows red. Rhodey falls backwards, grunting.]
Woman: Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.
Rhodey: If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.
Woman: That's the plan, Colonel.
Tony Stark: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
Harley Keener: Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?
Tony Stark: How much have you had?
Harley Keener: Two or three bowls.
Tony Stark: Can you still see straight?
Harley Keener: Sort of.
Tony Stark: That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
Tony Stark: What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Tony Stark: Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Harley Keener: Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Tony Stark: Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
Harley Keener: Uh, it's not charging. [Tony pulls over to the side of the road, heavy breathing]
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.
Tony Stark: What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... [Breathing heavily] Oh, God, not again.
Harley Keener: Tony? [Tony gets out of the car] Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.
Tony Stark: Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
Harley Keener: Okay, um, uh... 
Tony Stark: [Panting] God, what am I gonna do?
Harley Keener: Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?
Tony Stark: Right.
Harley Keener: You said so.
Tony Stark: Yes, I did.
Harley Keener: Why don't you just build something?
Tony Stark: Okay. Thanks, kid. [He gets back in the car.] [Cut to Tony in a shop buying supplies.] [Cut to Tony building something.] [Cut to Miama, Florida. Tony climbs a wall and begins fighting guards. He makes his way into the house and finds a woman lying on a table.] [Cut to a different woman lying on a sofa with a man sitting at a desk.]
Woman: Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.
Man: [Scoffs] My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con... [Tony puts a gloved hand on his head, electrocuting him. He gets the gun and leaves the room. He makes his way to the bedroom and pulls the duvet off the bed, revealling two girls. Tony sushes them and the toilet flushes.]
The Mandarin: Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. [He laughs] Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
Vanessa: That's me.
The Mandarin: Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
Vanessa: There's some guy over here.
The Mandarin: They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.
Tony Stark: Hey! [Mandarin raises his hands]
The Mandarin: Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Tony Stark: Don't move.
The Mandarin: I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
Tony Stark: What?
The Mandarin: Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
Tony Stark: Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
The Mandarin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.
Tony Stark: What do you mean?
The Mandarin: It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.
Tony Stark: It is?
The Mandarin: It's complicated.
Tony Stark: Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. [Door closes. Gunshot. Women exclaim in fear]
The Mandarin: My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
Tony Stark: What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
Trevor Slattery: What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. [Tony points the gun at Trevor's face] Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.
Tony Stark: You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
Trevor Slattery: It's just a role. ""The Mandarin,"" see, it's not real.
Tony Stark: Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Trevor Slattery: Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.
Tony Stark: Next?
Trevor Slattery: Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.
Tony Stark: What did they say? They'd get you off them?
Trevor Slattery: They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things. [Snoring]
Tony Stark: Did you just nod off? Hey. [Tony kicks him]
Trevor Slattery: No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions. [Mimic explosion]
Tony Stark: ""He""? Killian?
Trevor Slattery: Killian.
Tony Stark: He created you?
Trevor Slattery: He created me.
Tony Stark: Custom-made terror threat.
Trevor Slattery: Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.
Tony Stark: Your performance? Where people died?
Trevor Slattery: No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... [Savin hits Tony around the head, unconcious]
Savin: Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
Trevor Slattery: I didn't tell him anything.
Savin: Nothing?
Trevor Slattery: No.
Savin: You should have pressed the panic button.
Trevor Slattery: Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
Tony Stark: Ah... [Sighs] Okay. 
Maya Hansen: It's just like old times, huh?
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
Maya Hansen: It wasn't my idea.
Tony Stark: Okay. So you took Killian's card.
Maya Hansen: I took his money.
Tony Stark: And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
Maya Hansen: No.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Maya Hansen: No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
Tony Stark: Yeah? 
Maya Hansen: [Sighs and walks towards him] A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.
Tony Stark: [Shouting] I'm telling you it isn't. [Lowers voice to usual volume] I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Maya Hansen: Then help me fix it. [She shows him the ""You Know Who I Am"" note he left in 1999.]
Tony Stark: Did I do that?
Maya Hansen: Yes.
Tony Stark: I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?
Maya Hansen: You don't remember?
Tony Stark: I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
Aldrich Killian: You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... ""The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.""
Tony Stark: You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
Aldrich Killian: How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.
Tony Stark: Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
Aldrich Killian: But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.
Tony Stark: You're something else.
Aldrich Killian: You have met him, I assume?
Tony Stark: Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
Aldrich Killian: I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.
Tony Stark: What's next for you in your world?
Aldrich Killian: Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me. [Killian rolls three balls forwards and they stop, projecting an image of Pepper. She has Extremis.] Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?
Maya Hansen: Let him go.
Aldrich Killian: Hold on, hold on. Maya...
Maya Hansen: I said, let him go.
Aldrich Killian: What are you doing?
Maya Hansen: 1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
Aldrich Killian: It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.
Maya Hansen: If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?
Aldrich Killian: We're not doing this, okay?
Maya Hansen: What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot? [He looks back at Tony and shoots Maya]
Aldrich Killian: The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.
Tony Stark: You are a maniac.
Aldrich Killian: No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight. [Killian leaves and talks to Savin] Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Savin: Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it. [Whirring] 
Aldrich Killian: Afternoon, gentlemen. [Whirring ceases] Hello, Colonel. Step aside. [Killian places his hand on the suit and it blows orange.] Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.
Savin: You'll damage the armour.
Aldrich Killian: Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.
Savin: She's still in Phase Two.
Aldrich Killian: You're not going deaf, are you?
Tony Stark: [Watch beeping.] Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
Guard #1: 832 miles.
Tony Stark: Very nice.
Guard #1: I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?
Tony Stark: Break it, you bought it.
Guard #2: I think I bought it.
Tony Stark: Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.
Guard #2: What are you gonna do to me?
Tony Stark: You'll see.
Guard #2: You're zip-tied to a bed. This. [Nothing happens.] That. [Nothing happens again] 
Alrich Killian: Are you coming out?
Rhodey: [Panting and sweating] Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open. [Beeping.] All right. Let's go. [The suit opens, Rhodey jumps and punches Savin in the face, then kicks him. Killian glows red and breathes fire at Rhodey.] You... You breathe fire? Okay. [Savin knocks Rhodey unconcious.]
Aldrich Killian: It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Tony Stark: Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...
Guard #2: How did we get this shift?
Tony Stark: All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!
Guard #2: Wow. That was...
Tony Stark: You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
Guard #2: I am just beyond terrified.
Tony Stark: Here it comes. Three, four...
Guard #2: Shut up.
Tony Stark: [Quickly] Five, four, three, two, one! [The Iron Man suit joins to his left arm] Told you. Where's the rest? [He blasts one of the men and unties himself. As they fight, the suit connects to his rigth leg and he kicks them] Where's the rest? [Meanwhile, Harley watches as the garage door shakes. He runs over and blows it open. The suit flies out.] [Repulsor powering up, gunfire, screaming.] 
Man: Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. [Tony leaves.]
Tony Stark: Ah! Better late than never. [He gets outside and catches the face mask.] Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.
Guard: [Beeping, Rhodey wakes up.] All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.
Tony Stark: Ah! Let's go! [Thrusters misfiring.] Aw, crap.
Rhodey: Tony?
Tony Stark: Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
Rhodey: No. You got yours'?
Tony Stark: Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
Rhodey: You, you, you! Move! Get out!
Tony Stark: [Girls whimpering] The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
Rhodey: What's this? I had winners. [Gunshots. Trevor wakes up and begins drinking beer again.]
Tony Stark: What have you come as?
Rhodey: You make a move, and I break your face.
Tony Stark:I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
Rhodey: This is the Mandarin?
Tony Stark:Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
Trevor Slattery: Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Tony Stark:Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
Rhodey: You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
Trevor Slattery: Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.
Tony Stark: Spill.
Rhodey: Do you know what they did to my suit?
Tony Stark: What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
Trevor Slattery: Woah! [Rhodey jumps.] Ole', ole', ole', ole'...
Rhodey: Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.
Tony Stark: Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?
Rhodey: Yeah, a little bit.
Tony Stark: So?
Rhodey: What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.
Tony Stark: Right. [Beer opens] Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a ""lovely speedboat""? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
Rhodey: But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?
Tony Stark: Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
Vice President: Thanks. Hello?
Tony Stark: Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Vice President: Welcome back to the land of the living.
Tony Stark: We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
Vice President: Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.
Rhodey: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.
Vice President: Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodey: Rhodes and Stark out.
Man: Everything okay, sir?
Vice President: Couldn't be better. (To his daughter) I love you, babe.
[The Iron Patriot lands and walks towards President Ellis]
President Ellis: Colonel Rhodes. [Salutes] Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.
Rhodey: We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.
Tony Stark: And what about the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
Tony Stark: That's going to have to do.
[The Iron Patient's arm opens and the suit wearer puts their hand against the door handle on a plane, burning it.]
Military Aide: Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin.
Savin: It is an honour, Mr President.
President Ellis: If you're gonna do it, do it!
Savin: Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works.
Officer: Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Officer #2: Get me eyes on it now.
Officer: Image coming through now, sir.
Officer #2: Was that Rhodes?
Man: Is anyone there?
Woman: Let us out! [Tony attacks Savin and pins him against the wall.]
Tony Stark: The President. Now.
Savin: He's not here. [Savin burns the Iron Man suit's arm. Electrical crackling, mechanisms grinding, soft groaning.] Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. [A door blasts open on the plane, people screaming, metal creaking, more screaming. Tony blasts Savin in the chest.]
Tony Stark: Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. [Savin falls to the ground.] How many in the air?
JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.
Tony Stark: How many can I carry?
JARVIS: Four, sir.
Tony Stark: Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather? 
Heather: [Screaming] Oh, God! No! No!
Tony Stark: Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?
Heather: What? Oh!
Tony Stark: I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Tony Stark: Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.
Tony Stark: Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!
JARVIS: 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.
Tony Stark: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. [Tony drops them all in the water from a few feet above.]
Man: We made it!
Tony Stark: Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... [The Iron Man suit flies into a truck and the suit disassembles. He sighs.] That came out of nowhere. Wow [We now see Tony on the boat, where he was controlling the suit.]
Rhodey: Give me some good news, man.
Tony Stark: I think they all made it.
Rhodey: Oh, thank God.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but I missed the president.
Rhodey: You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?
Tony Stark: Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
JARVIS: The House Party Protocol, sir?
Tony Stark: Correct.
Aldrich Killian: [Pepper wakes up and gasps.] Hi. 
Pepper Potts: [Breathing heavily.] You think he's gonna help you? He won't.
Aldrich Killian:  Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um...
Pepper Potts: Trophy 
Aldrich Killian: [Chuckles.] Mmm. [Iron Patriot walks in and Pepper gasps.] Good evening, sir. [The armor opens and the President falls out.] Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.
President Ellis: This is the Roxxon Norco.
Aldrich Killian:And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.
President Ellis: What do you want from me?
Aldrich Killian: Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up.
President Ellis: Hey!
Rhodey: [Climbs on to the boat.] Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?
Tony Stark: I hope not.
Rhodey: Oh, my God. [Sighs] He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
Tony Stark: Viking funeral. Public execution.
Rhodey: Yeah, death by oil.
Announcer: (On PA) Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.
Aldrich Killian: Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal. (Technician typing)
Rhodey: ls your gun up?
Tony Stark: Yep. What do I do?
Rhodey: Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.
Tony Stark: Six, high, back. Alright. [Gunfire, bullets ricocheting] You see that? Nailed it.
Rhodey: Yeah, you really killed the glass.
Tony Stark: You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. [Rhodey fires a bullet and hits the bulb.]
Announcer: [On PA] All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.
Man: Over there!
Announcer: [On PA] I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
Tony Stark: I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
Rhodey: They're not universal, Tony.
Tony Stark: I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.
Rhodey: Okay
Tony Stark: Give me one of yours.
Rhodey: I don't have one that fits that gun.
Tony Stark: You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?
Rhodey: What'd you see?
Tony Stark: Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. [Clears throat] Three guys, one girl, all armed.
Rhodey: God, I would kill for some armour right now.
Tony Stark: You're right. We need backup.
Rhodey: Yeah, a bunch.
Tony Stark: You know what? [He nods at something in the distance, whooshing]
Rhodey: Is that...?
Tony Stark: Yep.
Rhodey: Are those...?
Tony Stark: Yeah. [Dozens of Iron Man suits fly over.] Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.
JARVIS: [Through armors] Yes, sir.
Tony Stark: What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
JARVIS: Gentlemen. [Grunting, screaming.]
Tony Stark: Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. [Mechanisms whirring.] 
Rhodey: This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?
Tony Stark: Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? [Tony suits up.] Nice timing.
Rhodey: Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
Rhodey: What does that mean?
Tony Stark: I got you covered.
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
Rhodey: Very funny.
JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.
Tony Stark: About time. 
Pepper Potts: [Gasps, panting.] Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
Tony Stark: See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
Pepper Potts: You're such a jerk.
Tony Stark: Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. [Metal creaking, Pepper sobbing.] Come on. A little more, baby. [Pepper straining, Tony grunting. Killian shoves his hand on Tony's suit, burning it.] 
Aldrich Killian: Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there? [Sizzling.] Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.
Pepper Potts: Tony.
Aldrich Killian: She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. [Tony cuts off Killian's arm, it burns through the floor and Pepper falls down.]
Tony Stark: Yeah, you take a minute. [Groaning, sizzling, metal creaking, yelling, grunts, Pepper whimpers.] Jarvis, give me a suit right now! [The suit he called gets destroyed.] Oh, come on!
Rhodey: Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. [Gunfire] Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself.  You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.
Tony Stark: Nice work.
Rhodey: Ready, sir?
President Ellis: What do you mean ""ready""? [Rhodey blasts off and the President screams.]
Tony Stark: Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! [Pepper falls to the ground and into the flames below.]
Aldrich Killian: A shame. I would've caught her. [Tony and Killian run towards each other. Killian jumps up to attack, Tony slides under and armors up. Repulsors firing, flesh burning, both grunting.]
Tony Stark: Eject. [More repulsors firing.]
Aldrich Killian: Well, here we are on the roof. [Killian slices the suit in half.]
JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.
Tony Stark: I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. [The suit flies to Tony, hits a piece of metal and falls apart. Rolls his eyes.] Whatever.
Aldrich Killian: You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.
Tony Stark: Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. [Tony motions to the suit and it flies on to Killian.] Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
Aldrich Killian: [Muffled screaming.] No! [He walks towards Tony, his flesh held together by flames.] No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am the Mandarin! [Someone hits Killian and he flies to the side. It's Pepper. Heavy breathing.]
Tony Stark: I got nothing. [Repulsor powering up.] Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? [Pepper runs towards Tony, flips in the air, punches through the Iron Man suit and destroys it. She uses the suit to blow up Killian.] Honey?
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God. That was really violent.
Tony Stark: You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
Pepper Potts: I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?
Tony Stark: It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
Pepper Potts: You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?
Tony Stark: Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.
Pepper Potts: No, don't touch me.
Tony Stark: Don't worry about it.
Pepper Potts: No, I'm gonna burn you.
Tony Stark: No, you're not. Not hot.
Pepper Potts: Am I gonna be okay?
Tony Stark: No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.
Pepper Potts: And all your distractions?
Tony Stark: Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?
Tony Stark: You know what to do.
JARVIS: The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Tony Stark: Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. [Pepper and Tony hug as the Iron Man suits blow up.] Okay, so far? Do you like it?
Pepper Potts: It'll do.
Tony Stark (V.O): And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.
Trevor Slattery: Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
Tony Stark (V.O): But then I thought to myself, ""Why stop there?"" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you,[Metal clinking.] that was the best sleep I'd had in years.
Nurse: [Happy wakes up, gasping and coughing.] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Happy Hogan: [Weak] No, look. 
Tony Stark (V.O): [Throws Arc Reactor into the ocean.] So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man. [Thrilling music playing, credit scene.] You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.
Tony Stark: To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. [The camera zooms out to show Bruce Banner, asleep.] And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... [Tony stops and looks over as Bruce rubs his eyes.] Are you with me?
Bruce Banner: Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...
Tony Stark: Are you actively napping?
Bruce Banner: [Stammering] I was... I... I drifted.
Tony Stark: Where did I lose you?
Bruce Banner: Elevator in Switzerland.
Tony Stark: So, you heard none of it?
Bruce Banner: I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.
Tony Stark: So?
Bruce Banner: I don't have the...
Tony Stark: What? The time?
Bruce Banner: Temperament.
Tony Stark: You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?
Bruce Banner: Yes.
Tony Stark: I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird."

 Avengers: Endgame
 Black Widow


[The Columbia Pictures logo plays normally. At the end, the Torch Lady fades into a statue in Ixtenco, Mexico.]
[A car drives up to a destroyed village in that place. Maria Hill and Nick Fury get out]
Maria Hill: Nick, this was a tragedy, but it's not why we're here. What, are we fighting the weather now?
Nick Fury: Locals say the cyclone had a face.
Maria Hill: People say things when they're under stress. Okay, that does not mean that this is the start to another big world-
[A green cloud of smoke appears in front of them. Both pull out their guns, looking towards a strangely dressed man.]
Quentin Beck: Who are you?
[The Earth Elemental, that appears to be made from rocks, comes from the ground in the village.]
Quentin Beck: You don't want any part of this. [he steps forward, green blasts shooting from his hands]
[Marvel intro plays to 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston (1963 - 2012). A poorly edited video in tribute of the fallen Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man, Steve Rogers/Captain America (although it is unknown that he actually died.), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and Vision plays. It shifts to show Midtown School's news show with Betty Brant and Jason Ionello]
Betty Brant: Gone. But not forgotten. 
Jason Ionello: Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy for their help with that touching video tribute.
Betty Brant: This year has been nothing short of-
Jason Ionello: [a beep blocks out what he said] S**t is crazy. It's like, insane.
Betty Brant: Jason.
Jason Ionello: What?
Betty Brant: No swearing.
Jason Ionello: Yeah, it's like the last day of school, we're good.
Betty Brant: Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High was wiped from existence. But then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes brought us back. They called it the Blip. Those of us who blipped away came back the same age. But our classmates that didn't blip grew five years older.
Jason Ionello: Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me.
Betty Brant: (annoyed) Yeah, it's math. And even though we had blipped away half way through the school year and had already taken midterms, the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning.
Jason Ionello: Totally unfair. It's not right.
Betty Brant: Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road. As we draw this year to a close, it's time to move on to a new phase of our lives.
Jason Ionello: Pray nothing crazy happens again because, are the Avengers even a thing anymore? Does anyone even have a plan?!
[In a classroom, Peter Parker sits down next to Ned Leeds.]
Peter Parker: I have a plan. (enthusiastic) Okay, first, I sit next to MJ on the flight.
Ned Leeds: Mhm.
Peter Parker: Second, I’m gonna buy a dual headphone adapter and watch movies with her the whole time.
Ned Leeds: Okay.
Peter Parker: Three, when we go to Venice, Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass, right?
Ned Leeds: True.
Peter Parker: So, I’m gonna buy her a Black Dahlia necklace, because her favorite flower is the Black Dahlia, because of, well...
Ned Leeds: The murder.
Peter Parker: The murder. Four, when we go to Paris, I’m gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace...
Ned Leeds: Oh!
Peter Parker: And then five, I’m gonna tell her how I feel...And then six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way.
Ned Leeds: Oh! Don’t forget step seven.
Peter Parker: [thinking] Step seven...
Ned Leeds: Don’t do any of that.
[Peter looks up, confused.]
Peter Parker: Why?
Ned Leeds: Because we’re gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter!
Peter Parker: Ned...
Ned Leeds:  Look, I may not know much, but I do know this: Europeans love Americans.
Peter Parker: ...Really?
Ned Leeds: And more than half of them are women!
Peter Parker: Okay, sure, but...I really like MJ, man. Okay? She’s awesome, she’s funny in a sort of dark way, and sometimes I catch her looking at me, and I like I’ve feel stood up way too...Wait. Dude, she’s coming now. Just don’t say anything.
[Michelle Jones walks over to them.]
MJ: What up, dorks? Excited about the science trip?
Peter Parker: Hey, uh, yeah. We’re just talking about the trip.
Ned Leeds: Yeah, and Peter’s plan.
MJ: You have a plan?
Peter Parker: I don’t-I don't have a plan.
Ned Leeds: No, he’s just going to collect tiny spoons while we’re traveling to other countries. (winks at Peter)
MJ: Like a grandmother?
Peter Parker: I’m not collecting tiny spoons. He’s collecting tiny spoons.
MJ: Oh. Okay, well...that was a real roller coaster.
Peter Parker: Mhm...
MJ: By the way, travel tip: You should probably download a VPN on your phone, just so that the government can’t track you while we’re abroad.
Peter Parker: Smart. Will do.
[MJ leaves.]
Ned Leeds: Dude, I think that went really great!
[Peter seems to disagree.]
[In the Homeless Support building, Spider-Man (in his Iron Spider suit) and his Aunt May are on stage.]
Aunt May: When I blipped back to my apartment, the family living there was very confused. The wife thought that I was a mistress. (the audience laughs) The Grandma thought that I was a ghost. (more laughter) It was, (laughs) it was really a mess. Thank you all for coming out to support those who have been displaced by the Blip, and, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man!
[The audience erupts in applause for Spider-Man. Aunt May gestures Peter to the microphone.]
Spider-Man: Thank you, Ms. Parker, for having me. And thank you guys for having me. [Awkwardly gives the audience a thumbs-up.]
[The audience cheers once more.]
Aunt May: And thank you Spider-Man, and he’ll be right back out to take photos and videos, thank you!
[Peter and Aunt May head backstage. Peter unmasks himself.]
Peter Parker: That was amazing.
Aunt May: That was great. (high-fives Peter)
Peter Parker: Ah, that was so cool. I was a little nervous!
Aunt May: My body was a little stiff, I felt like I wasn’t in the pocket.
Peter Parker: No, I thought you did great!
Aunt May: Yeah, well, actually, I did think you were a little stiff.
Peter Parker: [shrugs] I felt that, too, I felt that, too.
Aunt May: It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine. Did you get your passport?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Aunt May: Mini toothpaste?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
[Happy Hogan enters. He’s carrying a big check for the homeless.]
Happy Hogan: Hey, sorry I’m late.
Peter Parker: Happy, hey!
Happy Hogan: [to May] Oh, you look lovely.
Aunt May: Thanks, you too.
Happy Hogan: Thank you. New dress?
Aunt May: Uh, yeah. Yes, it is. That’s a new beard.
[Peter looks back in forth between the two, confused.]
Happy Hogan: It’s my Blip beard, because I grew it in the blip. Blip beard.
Aunt May: I see.
Happy: Anyway, the reason I'm late is because this was misplaced at the office. Can you believe it? Because it's enormous. I mean, not the amount, the size. The amount's nice too.
Aunt May: (laughs) Oh.
Happy Hogan: The very generous Pepper Potts, said...
Aunt May: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: ...she’s sorry she couldn’t be here.
[Peter is still looking at them in confusion]
Aunt May: I think I’m going to go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagna. (to Peter) Spider-Man, go shake hands.
Peter Parker: Will do. [turns to Happy as May leaves] What just happened?
Happy Hogan: Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.
Peter Parker: Nick Fury’s going to call me?
Happy Hogan: Yeah.
Peter Parker: Why?
Happy Hogan: Why? Because he probably has some hero stuff for you to do. You’re a superhero. He calls superheroes.
Peter Parker: Well, I mean if it was really that important, he’d probably call someone else. Not me.
[inside Peter’s bag, his phone begins to ring]
Happy Hogan: Apparently not. [Peter pulls out his phone from the bag] No caller ID. That’s him.
Peter Parker: I don’t really want to talk to Nick Fury.
Happy Hogan: Answer the phone.
Peter Parker: Why?
Happy Hogan: Because if you don’t talk to him, then I have to talk, and I don’t want to talk to him.
Peter Parker: Why don’t you want to talk to him?
Happy Hogan: Because I’m scared. Just answer the phone! [Peter holds up his phone, and declines the call] You sent Nick Fury to voice mail?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: You don’t send Nick Fury to voice mail!
Peter Parker: Did you hear that? They’re calling me. I got to go. I got to go.
[Peter starts to back away]
Happy Hogan: You got to talk to him.
Peter Parker: I’m going to call him. I promise you. I’m going to call him. I will.
Happy Hogan: You do not ghost Nick Fury!
Peter Parker: I promise you, I’ll call him. [Peter backs out of the room through the curtains, and whispers to himself] After my trip.
[Peter puts his iron-mask on as he backs away and turns around to open the curtain. He jumps up as he enters the stage]
Peter Parker: Hey! [waves]
[From the other room, Happy gets buzzed. He puts his phone up to his ear.]
Happy Hogan: Yeah? Hi -- No, no, he's not ghosting you.
[FROM THE STAGE]
[Reporters crowd all around Peter as he just entered. The crowd is speaking indistinctly. Peter backs away, putting a hand up, so they could stay back.]
Peter Parker: Okay, one question at a time.
[Peter points to the Asian woman.]
Woman: Are you the head Avenger? Are you the head Avenger now?
Peter Parker: Uh, no I'm not.
[He points to another woman, who leans over the crowd of reporters.]
Woman: If the aliens come back, what are you gonna do?
[Peter looks around.]
Peter Parker: Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?
[Everyone starts asking desperately. He leans in for a man to ask a question, hoping it's a neighborhood question.]
Sean: Sean Wilford, Queens Tribune. What is it like to take over from Tony Stark? Those are some big shoes to fill.
[His question echoes Peter's mind. Everyone's still asking questions as he has time to think of his answer. He started to have anxiety and feels like he is about to pass out.]
Peter Parker: I'm uh-- I'm going to go. Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.
[He jumps up to the roof, to only find himself on top, looking out onto the city. His mask fades off and he breathes deeply as a large train passes by. A cellphone buzzes in his backpack and he reaches to get it. He never answers and the buzzing stops as he looks back into the city. He turns to his left to see a painting of Iron-Man coming right at him. He blinks as he turns away, feeling the pain and sorrow as he thinks about his long-lost friend.]
[PETER'S ROOM]
[An unknown phone number shows up on Peter's cracked phone as he packs his suitcase. He looks at it, but he sets it back down, upset. He pulls a bin from underneath the bed and takes some clothes out and sniffs them as he places it in his suitcase. He gets up, exhausted.]
Peter Parker: Okay.
[He stays there for a moment before he turns his head to see his old Spider-Man suit, hanging from his closet. He looks at it. He closes the closet. Suddenly, May Parker comes in with an banana in her hand.]
Aunt May: Hungry?
[She throws the banana at Peter's shoulder. It hits him and he jerks back, petrified. He gasps as he turns around to see May with her hands on her mouth, shocked.]
Aunt May: Oh... So sorry. Ha-ha. I thought you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.
[She points at him with a smile. He sighs, exhausted at that nickname.]
Peter Parker: Please do not start calling it Peter-tingle.
Aunt May: So what's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?
Peter Parker: No, I just really need this vacation. I need a break.
[May Parker comes to wrap her arms around Peter's neck. She hugs him.]
Aunt May: You deserve it.
[She rubs his shoulders as she pulls away.]
Aunt May: Yeah. [Turns around] You know what? You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it.
[Aunt May smirks as she walks away. Peter cringes.]
Peter Parker: Please stop saying ""tingle,"" May.
[He looks over at his suit.]
Peter Parker: No. [he closes the closet door]
[He looks over at his new suit that is in a cage. It looks like magic floating around it and a sign behind it says 'Iron Spider Charging Do Not Unplug.' His hand is still on the closet door as he looks at it in deep thought.]
Peter Parker: No. No, I'm not.
[He closes his suitcase.]
[AIRPLANE]
As the airplane flies by, we see Peter opening his window and looking out at the view. He smiles happily.
Ned taps him on the shoulder, excitedly.
Ned Leeds: Yeah!
Man 1: Can you help me get my stuff up?
Woman 1: Oh, sorry, that's mine.
Man 2: No worries.
[Betty Brant comes in, waving at some people. Mr. Harrington comes behind her, looking around the place.]
Mr. Harrington: Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either.
Mr. Dell: Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.
Mr. Harrington: I can't chaperone these kids alone.
[Suddenly, a familiar voice can be heard from the other side of the plane. It's Flash Thompson. He held a drink in his hand.]
Flash Thompson: Yo, Parker! This, is called an airplane. It's like the buses you're used to, [MJ walks by] except it flies over the poor neighborhoods instead of driving through them.
[MJ leans over to the flight attendant. Brad Davis is with her.]
MJ: Ma'am?
Flight Attendant: Mm-hm?
MJ: He blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21.
[Flash Thompson blinks at MJ as the flight attendant reaches to grab his drink out of his hand. He looks down as she grabs it.]
Flight Attendant: I'll take that.
[People start to laugh as Flash Thompson's eyes grow big. He turns to her.]
Flash Thompson: She's lying! I don't even know this girl.
[MJ turns around to the boys that are sitting there as Flash Thompson leaves. She looks at them and lifts her chin up in a 'hi' kind of way. Brad Davis smiles at them as he passes by.]
Brad Davis: Classic MJ, right?
[Peter Parker looks over at Brad Davis with a creeped out expression as Ned Leeds sits there with a cool one. He turns his head as Peter Parker starts talking.]
Peter Parker: Did you know Brad was coming?
[Ned Leeds shakes his head.]
Ned Leeds: It-- It's so weird. Like, one day, he's that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time, and suddenly, we Blip back, and he's totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him.
[Peter Parker narrows his eyebrows as they turn back around from watching Brad Davis and MJ put their stuff in the overhead compartments.]
Peter Parker: Not all the girls are after him.
Ned Leeds: No, man. They're all after him.
[MJ and Brad Davis are helping each other out.]
MJ [giggling]: Yeah. Here.
[Ned Leeds turns back around.]
Ned Leeds: Anyway, on to more important things. [He unzips his bag. He shows Peter Parker what he has.] It's a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time.
[Peter Parker looks back at MJ, staring at her for a split second before leaned into Ned's ear to whisper.]
Peter Parker: I need your help to sit next to MJ.
[Ned Leeds rolls his eyes as he sighs. Peter looks back at MJ again.]
Ned Leeds: Seriously?
Peter Parker: Yes, seriously.
Ned Leeds: What about all our plan? American bachelors in Europe!
Peter Parker: That's your plan! That's a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan.
[Ned Leeds looks at him with solemn eyes. He turns around and back again. Peter Parker looks desperately at him.]
Peter Parker: Please.
[Ned rolls his eyes as his head leans back.]
[Ned Leeds gets up from his seat over to MJ and Betty Brant, who are sitting next to each other. They look up at him.]
Ned Leeds: Hey, guys. Uh, there's an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies. Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be--
Betty Brant: He's allergic to perfume?
[Ned Leeds stays silent and shakes his head.]
Ned Leeds: Yeah, yeah, because it-- it makes his eyes water, and he can't really--
Mr. Harrington turns around in his seat after eavesdropping on the conversation.
Mr. Harrington: Peter has a perfume allergy?
Ned Leeds: Oh, uh...
Mr. Harrington: From experience, perfume allergies are no joke. I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up.
[Mr. Harrington gets up from his seat as Peter Parker does.] [MJ stands up as Mr. Harrington gives orders.]
Mr. Harrington: Ned, take MJ's spot. MJ, you take my spot. [Mr. Harrington turns toward Peter] Peter, let's get you out of there.
MJ: Sorry.
Mr. Harrington: Zach and Sebastian, you take Ned and Peter's seats.
Brad Davis: That's all right.
Mr. Harrington: Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Your safety is my responsibility and Mr. Dell's, but he's... [Mr. Dell can be seen snoring] I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!
[Peter Parker looks at Mr. Harrington like he's gone bonkers and picks up his bag.]
Mr. Harrington: Let's go!
[Peter Parker moves to his spot.] [Ned Leeds sits down next to Betty Brant, who looks depressed.]
[Peter Parker passed by Mr. Harrington and sat down at the spot next to him.]
Mr. Harrington: Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle.
[Ned Leeds turns around to Betty Brant.]
Ned Leeds: So did you want to play Beast Slayer?
Betty Brant: Nope.
[Awkward silence.]
Ned Leeds: Have you ever played any kind of PC game or--?
Betty Brant: No.
Ned Leeds: [Nods] Got it.
[Peter Parker is in the back with Mr. Harrington, looking upset as the teacher is telling a story.]
Mr. Harrington: Did I ever tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out?
[Peter Parker doesn't answer.]
Mr. Harrington: Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group. We had a fake funeral for her and everything. Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead. Wanna see the video?
Brad Davis: Well, I've gotta dual headphone adapter if you wanna watch a movie.
MJ: Only if it's depressing, or hilarious.
Mr. Harrington: [To Peter Parker] Oh you have a dual headphone adapter. We can watch together.
Pilot: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. Flight time today will be eight hours and forty-nine minutes to Venice, Italy.
[AIRPORT - VENICE, ITALY]
Peter Parker: Hey, man. Did you see Brad and MJ on the plane? They were watching movies and laughing the entire time.
Ned Leeds: Dude, don’t worry, okay? I’m sure it’s nothing.
Betty Brant: Hey, babe, can you hold this for me, please?
Ned Leeds: Yeah, of course
Betty Brant: Thanks
Peter Parker: What was that?
Ned Leeds: Well, we actually got to talking on the plane, and it turns out we have a lot in common. So, uh, we’re boyfriend-girlfriend now.
Peter Parker: Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?
Ned Leeds: Peter... those were the words of a boy. That boy met a woman. A very strong and powerful woman. And now, that boy’s a man.
Betty Brant: Babe?
Ned Leeds: Coming, babe.
[Through customs, Peter Parker is taken away from the group into a private searching area. A stern-looking woman places the case on a table, and unzips it.]
Peter Parker: There’s nothing in there, I swear
[The case is opened and reveals — Peter’s Spider-Man suit. There’s a yellow sticky-note taped to it saying “You almost forgot this — May xx”. The woman picks up the banana placed next to it.]
Attendant: This, no. [holds up banana]
Peter Parker: Sorry.
[Peter Parker has now rushed back to the school group.]
Peter Parker: I’m here! Mr. Harrington! I'm here, I'm here!
Mr. Harrington: Wait, wait, wait, Peter’s here. Thank goodness.
[The school group took a boat through the Grand Canale in Venice. They group is touristy, taking photos and videos of Venice.]
[Their boat pulls up to the most dingy-looking hotel in the area. With scaffolding covering the front, the ‘hotel’ sign hanging ’by a thread’.]
Mr. Harrington: Looks like we’re here. They're doing some renovations to the place. Getting some upgrades.
Student: This place is trash
Mr. Harrington: That must be the concierge.
[INSIDE HOTEL]
Mr. Harrington: Everyone, here we are! [He takes in the desolate insides of the hotel — it’s just as bad as the outside, maybe even worse. A cat standing on a table meows. Mr. Harrington steps into a puddle of water]
Mr. Dell: Oh whoa... whoa, whoa.
MJ: Tell me we’re not staying here.
Flash Thompson: This place is sinking.
Mr. Harrington: [with feigned enthusiasm] I think you mean charming!
Mr. Dell: Okay everybody. Drop your bags off and we’re gonna meet at the Da Vinci museum at 3. Let's go!
Me Harrington: Vamanos!
MJ: It’s andiamo.
Mr. Harrington: Andiamo!
Mr. Dell [to the students]: When in Rome, you do as Romans do. When you’re in Venice, your socks get wet!
[Students grumbling]
[Students are now at the Saint Marco Polo’s Square.]
Flash Thompson: What’s up, Flash Mob, how are you guys doing? I’m in Saint Marco Polo’s [Someone — probably a student — runs past and hits Flash in the groin. Flash doubles over.] — Oh!
[Ned Leeds and Betty Brant are getting a caricature drawing done of them.]
Betty Brant: This is so much fun!
Ned Leeds: Yeah? [chuckles awkwardly]
[Mr. Harrison is trying to take a photo of himself in front of the scenery. He sets his camera on the railing and posed awkwardly. The camera beeps and takes the picture. 
Grabbing the camera, Mr. Harrison nearly drops it. 
He looks at the picture and the camera slips from his hands, falling into the water.]
[Students are taking a photo in front of a touristy thing]
Student: Three, two, one, say ‘pizza!’
Other students: Pizza!
[MJ is standing with her arms out, pigeons perched on her arm and shoulder while Brad takes her picture.]
[Away from the crowd, Peter Parker enters a small shop.]
Peter Parker: Buongiorno.
Shopkeeper: Buongiorno.
Peter Parker: Hi, Uh, I’m looking for a, uh...
~CUT TO THE NECKLACE BEING COMPLETED~
Shopkeeper: Fiore Nero [he holds the black dahlia necklace up to the light]
Peter Parker: It’s perfect.
[Peter Parker has exited the shop and joined the fray of tourists and locals in Venice. He’s smiling to himself as he holds the bag. MJ comes up unexpectedly behind him.]
MJ: Boh!
Peter Parker: What?
MJ: Boh. It’s the most perfect word in the world. Italians created it, and I just discovered it.
Peter Parker: What does it mean?
MJ: That’s the thing, it can mean a million things. It can mean ‘I don’t know’, ‘get out of my face’, ‘I don’t know and get out of my face’. It’s the best thing Italy ever created, except for maybe espresso.
Peter Parker: Oh, so you’ve been drinking espresso.
[An Italian man comes up to them, holding a rose, gesturing between the pair.]
Man: German? American?
MJ: Boh
[The man frowns and walks off.]
Peter Parker: Whoa.
MJ: Boh is my new superpower. It’s like the anti aloha. I was born to say this word... So, what’s in the bag?
Peter Parker: Oh, uh.... Boh.
MJ: Nice.
[MJ notices the many crabs escaping the water by drawing up the pillars at one of the many docks. She pulls out her phone to take a picture.]
MJ: Whoa, cool.
[Peter Parker notices the water being sucked into a grate.]
[Waves rock the boat where Ned Leeds and Betty Brant are comparing hands and smiling at each other.]
Betty: What was that?
[The waves continue before the water becomes still for a split second. Water erupts from the canal and people scream.]
[Ned and Betty scream as their boat is pushed towards shore by the waves.]
Peter Parker: Betty! You okay?
[Peter Parker helps Betty Brant and Ned Leeds out of the boat.]
Peter Parker: Come on!
Betty Brant: Guys, we gotta go!
[The water swirls into the air, forming the shape of a huge man. The colossal water monster roars.]
Ned Leeds: What is that?
Peter Parker: I don’t know.
Ned Leeds: What’re you gonna do?
Peter Parker: I left my suit in the hotel room.
Ned Leeds: Why?
Peter Parker: Because I’m on vacation, Ned! Everyone’s gonna see my face, just get them outta here!
[Peter Parker pushes Ned Leeds towards the stairs where Betty Brant and MJ are waiting. The water monster smashes its hand into a building. More people scream. The creature continues to smash buildings and boats. Peter helps people off the stairs.]
Peter Parker: Get out of here. Go!
[Peter Parker turns back to the monster as it crashes into a building in front of him. Peter Parker stumbles back.]
Peter Parker: Oh, my God!
[Peter Parker runs up the stairs and barely makes it around the corner before the monster smashes into the building where he had been standing.]
[More people are screaming and running away.]
[Peter Parker hits his wrist together to activate his web-shooters.{
Peter Parker [whispers]: Come on.
[Peter Parker moves around the corner and shoots a web at the monster. The web does nothing because the monster is made out of water. Peter Parker looks mildly exasperated.]
[People screaming]
[Peter Parker turns to see the monster heading towards a bridge swarming with people.]
Peter Parker: Oh no, you don’t!
[Peter Parker jumps across poles in the water and launches himself up onto the bridge by leaping off a peddle. He helps a man up.]
Peter Parker: You okay? Get out of here. Go!
[The water monster slams it’s fist into the bridge and Peter Parker is sent flying backward.] [Peter hits the other side of the bridge, now soaking wet. He coughs up water, panting to catch his breath.]
[A green light is seen shooting at the monster from above. Behind Peter Parker, there is a rumbling sound and a cloud of green mist appears in the sky. Out of the mist, a man with an elaborate suit with a cape appears, wearing a glass bowl over his head that swirls with mist.]
[Peter looks around and sees a masquerade mask on the ground.]
[The mysterious man shoots green light at the monster, dodging its attacks as he flies through the air.]
[The man is thrown onto the ground and the monster roars.]
[The man emerges from the water and flies at the monster once again.]
Peter Parker: Excuse me sir! I c- I can help! Let me help! I’m really strong and I’m...sticky!
Mysterio: I need you to lead it away from the canals!
[The man flies off as the monster smashes into the building where Peter stands. Peter flips away, landing on a nearby roof.]
[The monster smashes through a building.]
[Peter swings around it, attaching webs to hold it together.]
~CUT TO THE TWO TEACHERS LEADING A SMALL GROUP OF STUDENTS~
Mr. Dell: The DaVinci Museum. This is why we’re here in Venice.
Mr. Harrington: Oh, this is it. It’s closed.
Mr. Dell: What do you mean it’s closed? ‘Till when?
[Brad and another student stand in front of the museum.]
Student: November.
Mr. Dell: [to Mr. Harrington] You didn’t check the website?
Mr. Harrington: Oh, that’s a good idea.
[Mysterio followed by a blast of water, shoot behind them and the group runs.]
~CUT TO PETER ON THE ROOF~
Peter sees that the bell tower is about to fall on a bunch of people.
Peter Parker: Oh, come on!
[Peter swings towards the tower.]
Mr. Dell: [leading a group of students] Stay low, kids. We’ll be safe here.
[Peter is swinging around the bell tower, using webs to stick it back together. He lands in the top of the bell tower, ducking under the bell to get to the other side.]
[Peter takes off his mask, watching Mysterio fight the monster.]
[The bell tower starts to fall again.]
[Peter shoot a web, attaching it to two buildings across from him.]
The[ monster hits the tower again.]
[Peter falls, his head hitting the bell, making it ring.]
Peter Parker: [Groans]
[The tower cracks again, pulling Peter by his webs across it. Peter’s head hits the bell again.]
[The webs fall from the tower.]
[Peter shoots new webs, trying to hold the tower up.]
[Mysterio is still fighting the monster.]
~CUT TO GROUP OF STUDENTS WATCHING MYSTERIO~
Student: Who is that guy?
Brad Davis: I don’t know, but he’s kicking that water’s ass!
[Mysterio defeats the water monster.]
[Peter is still trying to keep the bell tower from falling. He yells out as the tower crumbles. His webs break and the tower finally crashes to the ground.]
[Mysterio lands and people begin cheering.]
[Peter gets up, checking the black dahlia necklace to make sure it’s not broken. He sighs in relief when he sees that it’s intact.]
[Mysterio salutes the crowd as they cheer for him before taking off and flying away in a cloud of green smoke.]
~CUT TO HOTEL~
[A handful of students are watching a television news report about Mysterio.]
Ned Leeds: It’s aliens. It has to be.
Flash Thompson: Buzzfeed says there’s a sailor named Morris Bench who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator and got hydro powers
MJ: Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the internet.
Flash Thompson: Spider-Man could take him
Mr. Harrington: What do you think it is?
Mr. Dell: You Know, being a man of science.... witches
Peter Parker: (on his phone away from the cluster of students) No, no, no, no. We wanna stay. We wanna stay.
Aunt May (at her office back in New York): It’s a good thing I packed your suit, huh. I can’t believe you forgot it.
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Aunt May: So, who was that guy you were with? Was that Mister Strange?
Peter Parker: Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, ummm... No. I don’t know who that was. He was a new guy. I was trying to help him, but...
[Peter is cut off by May on the other end of the phone]
Aunt May: Hey, Happy. No. That’s my lunch. Don’t eat that one.
Peter Parker: Happy’s there?
Aunt May: Yeah. It’s Happy. He’s here. He came by to volunteer. And, he’s hanging around the office. And he wants to say hi.
Happy Hogan: No, I don’t...[May forces the phone into his hand] Hi, Peter
Peter Parker: Hey, Happy...
Happy: I’m sorry. I’m working real hard here. I gotta do a leaflet drop.
Peter Parker: What're you doing...
Happy Hogan: I’m glad you’re having a good time. Don’t worry. I’m really taking care of your aunt.
[Aunt May retracts the phone from Happy’s ear and focuses back on Peter.]
Aunt May: So, uhh, how’s the plan going?
Peter Parker: There’s... some setbacks, for sure.
Aunt May: Don’t ever think it, just trust your instincts and you’ll be fine.
Peter Parker: I know. Love you. Bye.
Betty Brant: Who is that guy?
Brad Davis: He’s like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.
Flash Thompson: (scoffs) He’s all right. He’s no Spider-Man.
MJ: What is it with you and Spider-Man?
Flash Thompson: What? He’s just awesome, okay? He protects the neighborhood, and you know, he’s inspiring. He inspires me to be a better man.
[At this point, Peter renters the cluster of students.]
Flash Thompson: [toward Peter] ’Sup dickwad? I thought you drowned.
[woman on television speaking Italian]
Brad Davis: Sounds like his name’s Mysterio.
MJ: L’uomo del Misterio is Italian for man of mystery. They don’t actually know who he is.
Ned Leeds: Mysterio...
Betty Brant and Ned Leeds: Cool name
Betty Brant and Ned Leeds: Babe!
Peter Parker: (to MJ) So, how much did you actually see?
MJ: Not much... I was running.
Peter Parker: Right. me too. I was also running...away.
Peter Parker: So, Paris tomorrow. Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.
MJ: I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna to create an army of the insane.
Peter Parker: Oh...
MJ: Which is why it’s my favorite destination on the whole trip.
~NED AND PETER’S SHARED HOTEL ROOM~
Ned Leeds: What are you gonna do about the water monster?
Peter Parker: Nothing. it’s dead. And besides, that Mysterio guy’s all over it. Look... I just wanna spend some time with MJ. We were talking about Paris and... I think she really likes me.
Ned Leeds: That’s nice. Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love. I had just finished my first fruit cobbler, right-?
[Ned is hit with a dart in the neck by Nick Fury - who sits in a shaded corner of the room in a chair.]
Nick Fury: You’re a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.
Peter Parker: You’re Nick Fury. You just shot Ned.
Nick Fury: It’s just a mild tranquilizer. He’ll be alright. So good to finally meet you. I saw you at the funeral, but I didn’t think that was a good time to exchange numbers.
Peter Parker: No, that would have been really inappropriate
Nick Fury: That’s what I just said.
Peter Parker: Right.
Nick Fury: The important thing is, you’re here. I tried to bring you here. You avoided me, and now, you’re here. What a coincidence.
Peter Parker: Wait. Was this a coincidence?
Nick Fury: I used to know everything. Then, I come back five years later and now, I know nothing. No intel, no team, and a high school kid is dodging my calls.
Nick Fury: Here’s what I do know... a week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone. Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.
(Ned snores loudly)
Nick Fury: Three days later, a similar event in Morocco. A village was-
(a knock on the door cuts Fury off)
Mr. Harrington: Just making the rounds. See if anyone needs any emotional counseling after today’s traumatic event.
[Fury points his gun towards the door, hidden behind the wall so Mr. Harrington can't see him.]
Peter Parker: No. we‘re... we’re okay. We’re fine, thank you.
Mr. Harrington: Great. Cause I’m not qualified to actually...
(Ned snores)
Mr. Harrington: Oh, he’s passed out. I’m not really qualified to do it anyway, so... good night.
Peter Parker: That was my teacher, sorry about that. You were saying?
Nick Fury: A village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening...
(Fury is cut off again by another knock)
Betty Brant: Babe? You still awake? You’re not answering any of my texts.
Peter Parker: Um... he’s asleep, Betty.
Betty Brant: Oh, already?
Peter Parker: Mh-hmm. Yeah.
Betty Brant: Okay
Nick Fury: That’s why it’s imperative--
(Once more, another knock stops Fury.)
Mr. Dell: Hey, boys! So, that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria...
Nick Fury: (annoyed) Another person touches that door, you and I are going to attend another funeral. Suit up.
Mr. Dell: (In the background, still talking) ...let me know if either of you develops vomiting--
[Fury and Peter (who is in his Spider-Suit) are now seen on a boat]
Nick Fury: Stark left these for you. (He hands Peter a small case)
Peter Parker: Really?
[Peter opens the case to reveal a pair of glasses. The velvet lining of the case behind the glasses says ""Stark Industries""]
Nick Fury: ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."" (He looks at Peter) Stark said you wouldn't get that because it's not a Star Wars reference. (He scoffs)
[Cut to Peter and Fury walking into an underground base.]
Nick Fury: (to Peter) You can lose the mask. Everyone here's seen you without it. You'd only be feigning anonymity and breathing through spandex for no good reason.
[Peter pulls off his mask, taking in a deep breath.]
Nick Fury: Come on.
Peter Parker: (quietly) Yeah.
Nick Fury: Over there we have Maria Hill. That is Dimitri.
(Dimitri cocks his gun)
Nick Fury: And this is Mr. Beck.
[A man wearing a cape turns around. We recognize his outfit as that of Mysterio.]
Peter Parker: Mysterio?
Quentin Beck: What?
Peter Parker: Doesn't matter. It's just what my friends have been calling you.
Quentin Beck: Well, you can call me Quentin. (He holds out his hand for Peter to shake)
(Peter shakes his hand)
Quentin Beck: You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower. We could use someone like you on my world.
Peter Parker: (softly) Thanks. I'm sorry. Your world?
Nick Fury: Mr. Beck is from Earth. Just not yours.
Quentin Beck: There are multiple realities, Peter. This is Earth, Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.
Peter Parker: (excitedly) I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse? 'Cause I thought that was just theoretical. That completely changes how we understand the initial singularity. We're talking about an internal inflation system and how does that even work with all the quantum--? It's insane--
(Peter realizes everyone has turned to look at him, unamused)
Peter Parker: S-sorry. It's really cool. (he turns back to Beck)
Quentin Beck: Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.
(Peter smiles)
Maria Hill: Anyway...
A hologram appears on the table.
Quentin Beck: They were born in stable orbits within black holes. Creatures formed from the primary elements: Air, water, fire, earth. The Science Division had a technical name. We just called them Elementals.
Maria Hill: Versions of them exist across our mythologies.
Quentin Beck: Turns out, the myths are real.
Peter Parker: Like Thor. Thor was a myth and now I study him in my physics class.
Nick Fury: These myths are threats.
Quentin Beck: They first materialized on my earth many years ago. We mobilized and fought them, but with each battle, they grew, got stronger. I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them. All we did was delay the inevitable.
Maria Hill: The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates. Our satellites confirm it.
Nick Fury: So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three. There's only one left: fire.
Quentin Beck: The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth. It's the one that took my family.
Peter Parker: I'm sorry.
Maria Hill: And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.
Nick Fury: We have one mission: kill it. (to Peter) And you're coming with us.
Peter Parker: I'm sorry. Did you say Prague? (laughs nervously) Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kinda stuff. And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.
Nick Fury: Bitch, please. You've been to space.
Peter Parker: I know, but that was an accident. Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use. What about Thor?
Nick Fury: Off-world.
Peter Parker: Okay, um, Doctor Strange.
Maria Hill: Unavailable.
Peter Parker: Captain Marvel.
Nick Fury: Don't invoke her name.
Peter Parker: Sir, look, I really wanna help, I do. But if my aunt finds out that I left my class trip, she's gonna kill me. And if I'm seen like this in Europe, after the Washington Monument, my whole class will figure out who I am and then-- and then the whole world will figure out who I am, then I'm done.
Nick Fury: Okay. I understand.
Peter Parker: I'm sorry, what?
Nick Fury: Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you and become suspicious. Dimitri. Take him back to hotel, please.
Peter Parker: Thank you, Mr. Fury. And, uh, good luck.
Quentin Beck: See ya, kid.
Peter Parker: Yeah, see you. (to Agent Hill) Bye, ma'am.
Maria Hill: Yeah.
~CUT TO OUTSIDE THE HOTEL THE NEXT DAY~
Betty Brant: (talking to Ned) Okay, drink lots of water and I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill. You cannot get sick, okay?
Ned Leeds: Okay. Thanks baby.
Peter Parker: (exiting hotel) Hey, man. Are you sure you're good?
Ned Leeds: Oh, dude, I'm fine.
Peter Parker: Okay.
Ned Leeds: Seriously, getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury, probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me anyway.
Peter Parker: It is pretty awesome.
Ned Leeds: Yeah.
[They do a secret handshake.]
Peter Parker: I'm just happy I don't have to go to Prague.
Ned Leeds: Seriously.
Mr. Harrison: (exiting the hotel) Good news! We're going to Prague! Huh!
Peter Parker: What?
Students: Prague?
Mr. Harrison: Yeah, tour company called. They upgraded us. You should've heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell. All I heard was crying.
~CUT TO STUDENTS ROUNDING CORNER OF BUILDING~
Mr. Harrison: Look at our upgraded ride!
Ned Leeds: Peter, wha-- What's going on?
Peter Parker:  I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation.
[The camera cuts to a large black bus. Dimitri is standing beside it with a sign that says ""Midtown High"".]
Mr. Harrington: (holding out his hand to Dimitri) I'm uh, Mr. Harrington to the kids, uh... (Dimitri doesn't respond) Okay.
[They board the bus.]
Ned Leeds: Awesome.
Peter Parker: (unenthusiastically) Yeah. Awesome.
~EASTERN ALPS, AUSTRIA, AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BUS DRIVING DOWN A LONG WINDING ROAD SURROUNDED BY TREES~
Flash Thompson: (live-streaming on his phone) Yo, what's up Flash Mob? It's your boy, the big F. (Dimitri looks mildly annoyed) Cruisin' through the Alps with my private driver, Dimitri.
(A shot of Peter's phone shows him reading an article titled Top 10 Romantic Places in Prague)
[Peter catches sight of the glasses case Fury had given him. He pulls it from his bag and opens it, putting on the Tony Stark-style glasses. He pulls out a note, reading it.]
Peter Parker: (reading aloud) ""For the next Tony Stark, I trust you. (P.S.) say ""Edith"" (-T.S.)
[The glasses light up.]
E.D.I.T.H.: Stand by for retinal and biometric scan. (a scan of Peter's face appears) Retinal and biometric scan accepted.
Peter Parker: Hello?
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter. I am E.D.I.T.H., Tony Stark's augmented-reality security and defense system.
Peter Parker: Huh. So, he made you for me?
E.D.I.T.H.: No. But you have access to all of Tony's protocols.
Peter Parker: Cool.
E.D.I.T.H.: Would you like to see what I can do? E.D.I.T.H. stands for “Even dead, I’m the hero.” Tony loves his acronyms. 
Peter Parker: [chuckles] Yeah, he did. 
E.D.I.T.H.: I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network including multiple defense satellites as well as back does to all major telecommunication networks. 
[an image of what each person on the bus is doing on their phone shows]
Mr. Dell: [The History of Witchcraft]
Student: [text: Hey Mom, Venice was crazy! Can you transfer me more money?]
Mr. Harrison: [text: Looks like things are finally looking up! Finally some good luck]
Dimitri: [[encrypted]] 
Brad Davis: [internet search: Prague romantic...]
Flash Thompson: [text: Mother, have not heard from you or father in days]
Peter Parker: Is MJ texting? No. Don’t look at it. That’s–that’s wrong. That’s wrong. 
[He looks over at Ned and Betty who are sitting right next to each other]
Ned Leeds: [text: Miss you]
Betty Brant: [text: Miss you more]
Peter looks slightly bemused. 
[The bus pulls up to a rest stop]
Dimitri: [exiting the bus] Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!
Flash Thompson: [live streaming] Flash Mob, this is what we doing out here...
Mr. Dell: (frantically) Toilet, toilet, toilet. Which way to the toilet?
Mr. Harrison: Ten minutes everyone! Dimitri, where exactly are we? [Dimitri doesn’t respond] Yeah, okay, I’ll figure it out. 
Betty Brant: Oh my gosh, it’s so sick. It’s beautiful. 
[Peter exits the bus but is stopped by Dimitri]
Peter Parker: What?
[Dimitri gestures to a building with an open door where a stern-looking woman in all black is waiting]
[Cut to Peter entering the building cautiously]
Peter Parker: (nervously) Hello. 
Female Agent: (slight accent) Close the door.
[Peter closes the door]
Peter Parker: Um...I’m Peter Parker [he holds out his hand for the woman to shake]
Female Agent: [not shaking his hand] Take off your clothes. 
Peter Parker: (looking uncomfortable) Excuse me?
Female Agent: You told Fury Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe. So I made you this [she grabs a black folded suit from her bag] another suit. 
Peter Parker: Oh, uh, thank you. [he takes the suit] I’m sure it fits fine I don’t need to try–
Female Agent: (insistently) Take off your clothes.
Peter Parker: Okay... [he sets down his backpack] Sure. [he begins to unbutton his pants] It’s a little embarrassing. 
Agent: Now! Hurry up!
Peter Parker: [unzipping pants] This is weird. [pulls pants down]
[The door opens and Brad enters. The agent reaches for her gun. Peter quickly stops her from shooting Brad. 
Peter Parker: No, no, no. Don’t–
Brad Davis: Woah!
Peter Parker: Uh... 
Brad Davis: Sorry? Uh, I thought this was the bathroom. 
Peter Parker: [panicked] Thus is not what it looks like. Just–
Brad Davis: Yeah [takes a picture]
Peter Parker: What’re you doing?
Brad Davis: I’ll leave you two alone. 
[The agent pulls out her gun and points it at Brad’s back as he leaves]
Peter Parker: Oh my god. Don’t shoot anybody! Brad! [pulling up his pants as he runs out the door] It’s not what it looks like, buddy!
[He follows Brad outside, zipping up his pants]
Peter Parker: Hey, man, look, that’s–
Brad Davis: Look, Peter, I’m not here to judge your life’s choices, dude. If you wanna hook up with some random European chick on our school trip, that’s on you. 
Peter Parker: No, that’s not what that was. Honestly. 
Brad Davis: I can’t pretend I didn’t see what I just saw. I know you’re trying to get with MJ. It’s obvious. But I like her too. 
Peter Parker: Wait a minute. Hey, hey. You cannot show her that photo, dude. C’mon. 
Brad Davis: I’m sorry, man. I have to. She deserves the truth. [he turns to walk back to the bus]
Mr. Dell: [exiting the bathroom] Okay, put your one foot in front of the other, and everybody back on the bus. 
Mr. Harrison: It’s been ten minutes. Let’s go!
[Peter looks frustrated] 
[CUT TO BACK ON THE BUS]
[Peter looks to the back of the bus, where he sees Brad on his phone. He turns back, and pulls out E.D.I.T.H.]
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter. How can I help you?
Peter Parker: Hey! Um... there's this guy in my class who's cutting in on everything I wanna do with MJ...
E.D.I.T.H.: Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you. Can you please speak up?
Peter Parker: Um... Brad Davis, he has a photo of me?
E.D.I.T.H.: Brad Davis. Is he a target?
Peter Parker: ""Is he a target?"" Um...
[Peter peeks his head around the seat to look at Brad. He's on his phone, the picture with Peter and the agent clearly displayed alongside it. He looks over to MJ and then returns to his seated position.]
Peter Parker: Yeah. He's a target, he's a target.
E.D.I.T.H.: Copy that. Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.
Peter Parker: [surprised] Initiating what now?
E.D.I.T.H.: Intercept point determined. Releasing field vehicle.
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H.-
[Cut to a Stark Industries satellite in space. It releases something which drops into the atmosphere, burning up on entry and eventually revealing itself to be a weaponized drone. From the drone's HUD, we clearly see Brad Davis displayed as a target.]
[Cut back to the bus. Peter pulls off the E.D.I.T.H. glasses in shock.]
Peter Parker: Oh, my God...
[Flash reaches over and grabs the glasses out of his hand.]
Flash Thompson: Dope glasses Parker, how'd you pay for these?
[Peter frantically looks back and forth between Flash and the back of the bus, where the drone would be aiming, while trying to take the glasses back]
Peter Parker: Flash, give 'em back. Give me the- Flash-
Flash Thompson: No, no, no. I'm really paying you a compliment.
[Flash looks earnestly at Peter while fending off his reaching attempts to get the glasses]
Peter Parker: Please, give me the-
[Peter accidentally smacks Flash and knocks him out. He stares for a moment in shock]
Peter Parker: I'm so sorry.
[Peter reaches over and reclaims the glasses, hurriedly shoving them on]
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H., don't kill Brad.
[Cut to E.D.I.T.H. glasses HUD as Peter looks at Brad. The HUD is danger red and displays information about the bus at the bottom along with a small image of Brad in the right corner]
E.D.I.T.H.: Peter, would you like me to cancel the drone strike on Brad Davis?
[Peter starts to nod]
Classmate: Did you just punch Flash?
Peter Parker: No.
E.D.I.T.H.: Firing.
[Peter quickly turns and webs the wheel of the bus, causing it to swerve and a bullet from the drone to go through the side mirror]
Mr. Dell: Woah, look out! [specifically about the swerving, not about the bullet]
[Cut to outer view of the bus as it swerves wildly across the road, denting the side rail and nearly crashing into the side of the mountain]
[Cut back to inside the bus]
Mr. Dell: Aaa, this is not the autobahn!
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H.-
[Peter puts a hand up to where the side of the E.D.I.T.H. glasses should be, realizing that they fell off. Looking around frantically, he grabs them from the bus steps and quickly puts them back on]
E.D.I.T.H.: Commencing second strike. 
Mr. Harrington: Peter, plant your fanny in that seat and buckle up right now.
[Peter points out the window, in an effort to distract him]
Peter Parker: Look at the baby mountain goats!
Mr. Harrington: Baby mountain goats?! Ooh!
[Mr. Harrington and the entire rest of the class turn and look out that side of the bus]
[Cut to an aerial, slow-motion view of the bus as Peter leaps straight up through the emergency hatch at the top, hands forming the classic Spiderman web-shooting pose. A red light flashes on the drone as it prepares to fire again. Before it has the chance, Peter webs both the drone's guns over and then the drone itself to a large, passing boulder. This causes several small explosions on the drone before it snaps free from the rock, careening into the road where it explodes and smashes into pieces.]
[Cut back to the bus at normal speed where Peter drops back down, pulling the hatch closed behind him just in time for the rest of his class to turn back and stop searching for goats]
Mr. Harrington: Don't see any mountain goats.
[Peter, panting slightly and now with very windswept hair]
Peter Parker: You missed them. 
Betty Brant: I know you think none of us have noticed, Peter. 
[Both Peter and Ned look slightly panicked]
Peter Parker: What?
Betty Brant: But your new look? I love it. Right babe?
Peter Parker: Thanks.
[Distinctly relieved, Peter collapses back into his seat]
Ned Leeds: Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European. 
Peter Parker: (under his breath) Oh, man. Whoo. (normal volume) Let's try that again.
[Cut to Brad's phone as he quickly flips through his camera roll, expression confused and disbelieving]
Brad Davis: Uh, this is so weird. It was right here on my phone. I- I- 
MJ: Yeah, weird. 
[MJ glances up toward Peter as the camera cuts to show his head stuck out in the aisle before he quickly pulls back]
[Cut to Flash as he wakes up, moving his jaw and putting his hand to his cheek, right where Peter accidentally knocked him out]
Flash Thompson: Ow.
[Cut to outside the bus as it pulls past a parking lot. The screen then fades to display a large building in the city with a large mural commemorating Tony Stark before panning down to show the street, just as the bus passes by. The words ""PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC"" appear in white across the screen before fading as the camera pans up to show the city in a state of celebration, the sky now dark.]
[Cut to a quieter street where the bus pulls into a parking spot outside another large building]
[Cut to inside the building, where two men in suits pull open the doors for the class. The camera switches vantage points, showing the large, fancy reception area of the hotel, which even includes a grand piano and pianoman] 
Betty Brant: Wow, this place is so classy. 
Classmate: Yeah, so why are we here?
Flash Thompson: [cocky] Speak for yourself. [chuckles] I'm home. [turns back to his phone where he's obviously gone back to vlogging]
Mr. Harrington: What can I say? The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease. Uh, everyone get settled in, rest up because tonight, big surprise, is Prague's annual...
[Peter's phone buzzes]
Mr. Harrington: Carnival of lights! 
[Mr. Harrington gestures excitedly to a poster advertising the festival. Peter walks a little ways away to answer his phone]
Peter Parker: Hello?
Maria Hill: Parker, it's Hill. There's an earpiece with your suit. Put in on and await further instructions. Understood?
Peter Parker: Uh, yes, ma'am.
Maria Hill: Yeah.
[Ned hurries over and throughout their conversation, they send quick glances back towards their class]
Ned Leeds: Hey, man. Look, I am so sorry if I seem preoccupied with my relationship. You know, I'm still your guy in the chair.
Peter Parker: No, no, it's all good. Don't worry about it. 
Ned Leeds: Okay. Great, great. 
Peter Parker: It's fine.
Ned Leeds: So, what's the status on the whole Elemental thing? Where's it going to happen? 
Peter Parker: Uh, here in the city
Ned Leeds: Peter, we're here.
Peter Parker: I know, I know. It's not good. It's- I'm figuring it out. 
Ned Leeds: You have to do something, Peter, please. We're all counting on you. 
Betty Brant: [calling from back where the class has now clustered around Mr. Harrington as he shows them something] Ned.
Ned Leeds: Yeah. Yeah, babe. 
[He hurries back over to the rest of the class]
Mr. Harrington: The good news is, we've all got our own rooms.
[As the class around Mr. Harrington exclaims in surprise and joy, Peter stares off into the distance, thinking and worrying about the elemental]
Nick Fury: (O.S.) Parker? Parker!
[Peter startles and turns around as we cut to a makeshift S.H.I.E.L.D. base.]
Peter Parker: Yes, sir?
Nick Fury: That thing's going to be here in a few hours. Are we boring you?
Quentin Beck: He's not bored, he's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.
Nick Fury: He had obstacles. I removed them.
Maria Hill: They still won't evacuate the city.
Nick Fury: (groans) Idiots. So what's the plan, Parker?
Peter Parker: I will be in the cathedral tower keeping watch for the fire monster. When that shows up, I will radio you guys, and then Mr. Beck and I will-
Quentin Beck: My name is Mysterio.
[Quentin shoots Peter a playful look. Peter chuckles under his breath.]
Peter Parker: That's when Mysterio and I will move in.
Quentin Beck: Peter, listen to me. The best hope you have -- the only hope -- is to stop it here and now, no matter what the cost. Keep it away from civilians if you can, but, most important, keep it away from metal. If it gets too big, it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core. After that, there's no way to stop it.
[Peter briefly shares a glance with Fury.]
Peter Parker: Hey, man, my friends are here? And I can't help but think we're putting them in danger-
[Fury stands up and walks over to Peter.]
Nick Fury: You're worried about us hurting your friends? You? Who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus? Stark gave you a multi-billion dollar AR tactical intelligence system and the first thing you do with it? Is try and blow up your friends. It's clear to me that you were not ready for this!
[We cut to Peter, sitting alone on a rooftop. Mysterio flies up towards him with his helmet on]
Quentin Beck: Look, Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing. He just, he felt bad about snapping at you.
Peter Parker: (hopeful) Really?
Quentin Beck: You guys do have sarcasm on this earth, right?
[Beck sits down, right next to Peter]
Quentin Beck: How you feelin'?
Peter Parker: I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer. I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just... I had this plan with this girl that I really like, and...now it's all ruined.
Quentin Beck: (sympathetically) You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid. It's a hard path. You see things, you do things... Make choices. People look up to you... Even if you win a battle sometimes, they die. I like you, Peter. You're a good kid. There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just... turn around, run away from all this. And then, there's another part of me that knows what we're about to fight. What's at stake. And I'm glad you're here.
Peter Parker: Me, too. (worried tone) But...
Quentin Beck: (friendly) You're worried about your friends.
Peter Parker: Yeah. I just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.
Quentin Beck: Look, just... Get them inside and keep them in a safe place, for just a few hours. It'll be all right.
Peter Parker: It's really nice... to have somebody to talk to about, superhero stuff, you know?
Quentin Beck:  Anytime. And hey... (jokingly) We survive this, you'll have all summer to kill Brad.
[Peter and Quentin chuckle. Peter grabs his backpack.]
Peter Parker: See you out there.
Quentin Beck: Alright.
[Peter jumps off the building and lands on the floor. An old couple takes notice and looks at him.]
Peter Parker: Scusi! Sorry, that's Italian...
[Peter pulls the E.D.I.T.H. glasses out of his bag]
Peter Parker: Okay, uh, E.D.I.T.H.?
[The glasses initialize and Peter waits impatiently.]
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter.
Peter Parker: Hey! Uh... I need to find out a way to keep my friends inside for the next few hours.
E.D.I.T.H.: Let's see what we can do.
---This part is not finished. We will be pleased if you help us complete the transcript. :) - SpringsterR.317 (Minor Editor of fixers for the Marvel Transcripts)---
Betty Brandt: I would totally kiss you, but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.
Ned Leeds: I... I mi- I might have a mint!
[Cut back to the ground. Beck, Parker, and the SHIELD team sit amongst the rubble.]
Maria Hill: So, it's over?
Quentin Beck: That was the last of them?
Nick Fury: But not the last threat we'll ever face. We need to stay vigilant. There's a void in this world for someone like you. Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow. You should join us.
[Quentin stands, clasping Fury's hand.]
Quentin Beck: Thank you. I just might take you up on that.
[Fury turns to where Peter stands still as a statue and walks over. Beck sits back down.]
Nick Fury: You got gifts, Parker. But you didn't wanna be here.
Peter Parker: Mr. Fury, I--
Nick Fury: I'd love to have you in Berlin, too. But you've got to decide whether you're going to step up or not. Stark chose you. He made you an Avenger. I need that. The world needs that. Maybe Stark was wrong. Was he?
[Peter begins to tear up.]
Nick Fury: The choice is yours.
[Fury walks away from Peter, who casts his eyes down in shame. Beck stands and walks over to Peter, placing a hand on his shoulder.]
Quentin Beck: Let's get a drink.
[Quentin walks offscreen and Peter turns to look at him.]
Peter Parker: I'm not twenty-one...
[Cut to the inside of a packed bar. Quentin holds a bottle of beer in his hand and Peter looks down, dejected, at his glass.]
Quentin Beck: Hey.
[Quentin pats Peter on the shoulder.]
Quentin Beck: You gotta celebrate, you did something good tonight.
Peter Parker: Yeah...
[Quentin pats him on the back.]
Peter Parker: Fury was right. Tony did a lot for me, so... I owe it to him, to everybody.
Quentin Beck: Do you?
Peter Parker: Yeah! I mean... Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more, he wanted me to be better than him, and Fury just wants me to live up to that.
Quentin Beck: What do YOU want, Peter?
Peter Parker: What do you mean?
Quentin Beck: What do you want?
Peter Parker: …uh, I don’t… know…
Quentin Beck: What do you want, you, Peter Parker, right now? I know you’re thinking about it! What do-
Peter Parker: I wanna go on my trip Right? I wanna go back on my trip, with my friends. I wanna go to the top of the Eiffel Tower with the girl who I like and tell her how I really feel, and… give her a kiss! I don’t…
Quentin Beck: Ooh!
Peter Parker: Shut up, man! I...
Quentin Beck: But you're not gonna do that, are you?
Peter Parker: No, I can't!
Quentin Beck: Why not?
Peter Parker: Because I have too much of a responsibility!
[A local picks up the E.D.I.T.H. glasses and hands them to Peter.]
Peter Parker: Oh, my God, thank you so much!
Quentin Beck: What are those? Are those the...?
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H. glasses, yeah!
Quentin Beck: It was on the floor? Try them on, let's see how they look on you.
[Peter puts on the glasses and looks at Quentin.]
Peter Parker: ...I actually really like them!
Quentin Beck: Can I be completely honest with you?
Peter Parker: Please.
Quentin Beck: They look really stupid.
Peter Parker: Oh.
Quentin Beck: But maybe they have a contact-lens version of them.
[Peter takes off the glasses.]
Peter Parker: You try 'em on.
Quentin Beck: No, c'mon!
Peter Parker: Try 'em on!
Quentin Beck: I don't wanna- I don't wanna try 'em on!
Peter Parker: Just put 'em on!
[Beck takes the glasses from Peter and puts them on.]
Quentin Beck: What do you think, kid?
[Peter stares at Quentin for a long time, then breaks eye contact.]
Peter Parker: (to himself) ""To the next Tony Stark, I trust you..."" ""To the next Tony Stark, I trust you.""
Quentin Beck: What?
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark left me a message with those glasses; ""To the next Tony Stark, I trust you.""
Quentin Beck: I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?
Peter Parker: He knew every mistake I ever made, okay? So he must've known I was not ready for something like this.
Quentin Beck: Why would he give it to you?
Peter Parker: Because maybe he didn't trust me to have E.D.I.T.H., he just trusted me to pick who should. It makes so much more sense, he always knew I would do what's right and he's not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would just give himself E.D.I.T.H.
Quentin Beck: Alright, you're probably right about that.
Peter Parker: Right, so, the world needs the next Iron Man... and it's not gonna be me! I mean, I'm a sixteen-year-old kid from Queens. It needs to be an adult with some experience and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.
[Quentin looks at Peter for a moment and takes the glasses off.]
Quentin Beck: No, c'mon, Peter... No.
[Peter takes the glasses and puts them on.]
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Peter.
Peter Parker: Hi! Yeah, um... I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.
Quentin Beck: Peter, what are you doing?
Peter Parker: I'm doing the right thing.
E.D.I.T.H.: Any transfer will require confirmation.
Quentin Beck: Stark gave you the glasses!
Peter Parker: Stark gave me a choice! It's my choice to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it. Look, you're a soldier, a leader, you stopped the Elementals, you saved my life, you saved the world! Okay? He'd want you to have them.
E.D.I.T.H.: Waiting for confirmation.
Peter Parker: Confirm.
[Peter takes off the glasses and holds them out to Quentin.]
Peter Parker: Welcome to the Avengers.
[Quentin puts the glasses on as a few notes of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme play in the background. The two shake hands.]
Quentin Beck: Thank you. It's an honor.
Peter Parker: Yeah.
[Peter slings his backpack over his shoulder, standing up to leave.]
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark would've really liked you.
Quentin Beck: Where you headed?
Peter Parker: I'm gonna go find MJ.
Quentin Beck: Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance, you're pretty awkward, so...
[Peter laughs.]
Peter Parker: Yeah. See ya later, man!
Quentin Beck: See ya!
[Just as Peter has left the bar, several things start to gradually disappear, both objects and people are revealed to be holograms. Quentin, sitting in the middle of the illusion, starts to smile]
Quentin Beck: See? That wasn't so hard.
[The people that haven't vanished, erupt in applause and cheers]
Quentin Beck: (overjoyed) Somebody get this stupid costume off me!
[Outside, Peter walks past a memorial for Tony Stark, smiling and convinced he has done the right thing. In the ""bar"", Quentin, now without his superhero clothes, hands the glasses to one of his associates]
Quentin Beck: Okay, we got E.D.I.T.H.. Get these connected to our system.
Mysterio's Crew: Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
Quentin Beck: (trying to calm them) Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.
Mysterio's Crew: Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
[It's clear that there's no chance to stop the victory whirl, so Quentin steps on the counter]
Quentin Beck: Okay, toasts! Give me that, Doug! (grabs a bottle of champagne) To the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony Stark.
[He lifts the bottle in the air]
Mysterio's Crew: Boo!
Quentin Beck: The jester king. Literally wrapped in wealth and technology that he was unfit to wield. Like the holographic system I designed. A revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...
[Brief flashback of Tony in Captain America: Civil War, where Tony Stark presents his final meeting with his parents, using the same holographic technology]
Tony Stark: Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF...
[The crowd laughs while the hologram disappears and Tony takes off his glasses]
Tony Stark: Oh, $611,000,000 for my little therapeutic experiment...?
[Zoom in, Quentin Beck is standing behind Tony, with a disgusted grimace on his face]
Quentin Beck (vo): He renamed my life's work BARF.
[Back to the present]
Quentin Beck: I told him that it was a mistake. That my technology can change the world. And then... He fired me. Said I was... unstable. (determined) To Tony!
Mysterio's Crew: (all holding champagne) To Tony!
Quentin Beck: Next, to William.
[We get a brief flashback to the movie that started it all, Iron Man, where Obediah Stane yells at one of his employees, William Ginther Riva]
Obediah Stane: (yelling, pointing at William) Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
[Brief zoom in, a wipe brings us back to the current William]
Quentin Beck: The integration of my illusion tech, with your weaponized drones, was brilliant. Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm. And it's just the beginning.
William Ginther Riva: (proud) Thank you, brother.
Quentin Beck: To Guterman.
[Cut to another man, Quentin Beck's story writer and acting coach]
Mysterio's Crew: To Guterman!
Quentin Beck: The story you created of a soldier from another earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous! And apparently exactly the kind of thing people will believe right now! I mean, everybody bought it!
[More cheers from the group]
Quentin Beck: To Victoria.
Mysterio's Crew: To Victoria!
[Cut to a woman in her late twenties, early thirties]
Quentin Beck: Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies? Inspired idea. To Janice!
[Cut to another woman]
Mysterio's Crew: Janice!
Quentin Beck: After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that E.D.I.T.H. was being handed over -- not to us, not to the Defense Department, but to a child.
Janice: Thank you!
Man: (among the cheers) To Janice!
Quentin Beck: And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone. There is a window of opportunity and someone will step up. But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room, the most qualified, and no one cares. Unless you're flying around with a cape, or shooting lasers from your hands, no one will even listen. Well... I've got a cape. And lasers. (soft laughter) With our technology, and with E.D.I.T.H., Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth! (more cheers) And everyone will listen! Not to a boozy man-child!
Mysterio's Crew: No!
Quentin Beck: Not to a hormonal teenager!
Mysterio's Crew: No!
Quentin Beck: To me! And to my very wealthy crew! To us.
Mysterio's Crew: To us!
Quentin Beck: (lifting the bottle) To Mysterio!
Mysterio's Crew: To Mysterio!
Quentin Beck: To Peter Parker.
Mysterio's Crew: To Peter Parker!
Quentin Beck: (a bit of guilt) Poor kid. (back to business) Let's get to work.

Peter Parker: I am Spider-Man. And I messed up so bad.
----------------
[We see Mysterio flying around some kind of a storm Elemental, firing lasers at it]
Quentin Beck (vo): You took everything from me! This is for my family!
[The camera pans down, several people of Mysterio's crew admire or inspect the scene, while William is looking on his phone.]
Quentin Beck: Pause. Pause?
[We see Quentin Beck standing in the middle of the room, which looks suspiciously like a movie studio. He wears a motion capture outfit]
William Ginther Riva: (looking up) Sorry.
[William pauses the illusion]
Quentin Beck: Yeah, uh, can you just fast-forward to the end?
William Ginther Riva: Yeah. Standby.
[The visual flashes forward to the climax]
Quentin Beck: (mumbling to himself) Right. Fly, fly, fly... Zap, zap, zap... Pause.
[The Elemental freezes again]
Quentin Beck: I'm not in love with this choreography, but it'll do. Kill image.
[The illusion disappears]
Quentin Beck: Decloak drones.
[Where the Elemental used to be, several drones appear out of thin air when their cloaking devices are deactivated]
Quentin Beck: Right, weapons?
William Ginther Riva: You wanna weaponize them?
Quentin Beck: Yup.
William Ginther Riva: Weapons only. Standby.
[Several drones fly towards some prop pillars in the lot, firing at them as they fly by.]
William Ginther Riva: Nice.
Quentin Beck: Stop. Something... I don't know what it is. It's something... Just dou... You know what? Double the damage, and then run it again.
William Ginther Riva: You want me to double it up?
Quentin Beck: Yeah.
William Ginther Riva: Alright. Cover your ears.
[The image of the Elemental appears again. Through the underlying drones, it seems like he punches the pillars to pieces. Shortly thereafter, the holographic Mysterio fires a laser at it and defeats it]
Quentin Beck: That's good! That's good.
[William gives two thumbs up]
Quentin Beck: We're on schedule?
William Ginther Riva: Oh, yeah. Uploading software hack to E.D.I.T.H. network, where drones will be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.
Quentin Beck: Right, well done. Make sure every drone is weapons hot. We need maximum damage.
Guterman: That's gonna cause a lot of casualties.
Quentin Beck: Oh, yeah. More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static. London is a beautiful city and it will suffer, but they can rebuild. If I'm gonna be the next Iron Man, I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat. But, when its new savior descends...
[The holographic projection of Mysterio flies down and incapsulates Beck like a second skin. His voice is slightly altered and amplified]
Quentin Beck (vo): ...all those casualties will be forgotten.
[Mysterio's helmet disappears, Beck directs his attention to Janice, who is working on the real Mysterio suit]
Quentin Beck: Janice, you'll be in position with a quick change armor, for the victory lap?
Janice: Of course. Do you want to try...
Quentin Beck: No, no. That's...
[The footage becomes slightly distorted around Beck's waving upper arm]
Quentin Beck: What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?
William Ginther Riva: Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector. It's fine.
Quentin Beck: Wait, and you're... You're telling me this, now?
William Ginther Riva: It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.
Quentin Beck: That projector is evidence. It's going to tell people what we're doing and how we're doing it. I am trying to fool seven billion people here, including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet.
[Beck seems to get more unhinged as he goes on]
Quentin Beck: And if he catches on before I've killed him, then he will put a bullet in my head. And nobody wants a bullet in their head! Right?
[Two drones fly towards Guterman and Victoria]
Quentin Beck: Right?!
[Two others fly towards William, aiming at his forehead]
Quentin Beck: William, can you look at me?
[He does]
Quentin Beck: Pull up E.D.I.T.H..
E.D.I.T.H.: Hello, Quentin.
Quentin Beck: Yeah. Hi, honey. I need a level 5 search full resource protocol for this device.
[A map is projected and steadily magnified]
E.D.I.T.H.: Magnifying...
Quentin Beck: There. Search everything going in and out of that building.
E.D.I.T.H.: Located.
[Through video footage, we see how MJ got the projector, took it to the bridge and showed it to Peter]
Quentin Beck: Shit. (looking back at William, furious) You know William, one day, after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this... I hope you remember, that his blood is on your hands!
[Quentin walks out.]
[Cut to MJ's hotel room, where Peter frantically closes the window curtains.]
Peter Parker: I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses! I mean, how could I be that stupid? He's probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me.
MJ: You had access to killer drones?
Peter Parker: Yeah, I didn't really want 'em, especially after I almost killed Brad.
MJ: You almost killed Brad?!
Peter Parker: Look, I have to call Mr. Fury and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but... I think he tapped my phone.
MJ: Okay, so what are you gonna do?
Peter Parker: Well, I need my suit and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.
[Peter takes his shirt off in front of MJ, then stops to stare at MJ, clearly embarrassed. After a few awkward seconds, MJ gets the message and turns around while Peter strips down to his underwear and begins to put on the stealth suit. MJ still manages to sneak a peek, however, before the camera pans over to reveal Ned standing in the doorway. The two share a glance -- MJ impassive, Ned panicked.]
[Cut to a wide shot of Peter zipping up the Stealth Suit. He lifts up the eye visors.]
Peter Parker: Ah! Ned, perfect!
Ned Leeds: The costume looks great! For the costume party, at the... Prince's castle...
Peter Parker: She knows. I told her.
MJ: He didn't tell me. I figured it out.
[Ned hesitates, then slowly nods.]
Ned Leeds: Oh. That's cool.
MJ: Like, a long time ago.
Ned Leeds: ...oh.
Peter Parker: Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
Ned Leeds: But he- But he saved me and Betty's lives...
MJ: No, he's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.
Peter Parker: Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.
Ned Leeds: Whoa! That's... crazy!
MJ: Yeah.
[A beat while Peter and MJ share a glance.]
Ned Leeds: So, you guys were, like... working the case together, or what?
MJ: It's been mostly me.
Peter Parker: Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington, say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin until this all blows over, okay?
Ned Leeds: Got it. Easy.
MJ: Wow. You guys lie with such ease.
[Ned shrugs.]
Peter Parker: Gotta go.
[Peter starts to move out, pulling open the window curtains.]
MJ: Wait! Ah, wait, wait, wait! The projector. You're gonna need this.
[MJ throws Peter the projector, which he catches.]
Peter Parker: Don't tell anyone about this, okay? Anyone who knows is in danger.
[With that, Peter jumps out the window. MJ stares after him as the camera slowly pans over to Ned.]
Ned Leeds: So, you know, too. It's cool! Um. I mean, I've known first and I've known longer but it's not a competition...
[Cut to a train station where Peter swings onto the top of a moving train as it pulls out of the station. Cut to a wide shot of the city with the Berliner Fernsehturm in the foreground. The text ""Berlin, Germany"" is superimposed over the landscape.]
[The train pulls into the station and Peter jumps off, swinging over a crowd before landing in front of a civilian.]
Peter Parker: Uh, 'scuse me? Do you know where-
Woman: Nacht Monkey!
[The woman runs away.]
Peter Parker: No, wait, I didn't...! Aw, man!
[A black Audi pulls up in front of Peter. The window rolls down to reveal Nick Fury.]
Nick Fury: Get in.
[Peter does so and the car speeds off. Peter pulls off his mask, breathing heavily.]
Peter Parker: Mr. Fury!
Nick Fury: You've got a lot of explaining to do.
Peter Parker: No, no, no, listen!
Nick Fury: Wait until we're secure.
[Peter pushes himself back into his seat.]
Peter Parker: Okay...
[Peter takes a few deep breaths until Fury clears his throat. He makes a slashing motion across his chest, indicating for Peter to put his seatbelt on.]
Peter Parker: Right.
[Peter tugs on the seatbelt but finds that it's stuck. After a few attempts at loosening it, Peter tugs on the strap so hard that it finally breaks off. Peter nervously looks over to Fury, who gives him a disappointed look and turns his eye back to the road. The car pulls into the garage of a very fancy looking building.]
[Cut to the inside of a pristine white facility, teeming with staff members who Peter and Fury walk past. S.H.I.E.L.D. has obviously recovered from the events of The Winter Soldier quite well. Peter and Fury enter a conference room where Maria Hill is standing.]
Nick Fury: So... Is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend?
Maria Hill: He's talking about E.D.I.T.H.
Peter Parker: Look, I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry, but he is not who you think he is. Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake. He has some sort of illusion tech, and that's how he tricked you guys and he tricked me into giving him E.D.I.T.H.
[Peter pulls out the projector that MJ recovered and slides it across the table.]
Peter Parker: It's a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.
Nick Fury: So all that death and destruction we witnessed was caused by this?
Peter Parker: No, not just this! I think he's using drones.
Nick Fury: Well, if this is true, then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart. Who else did you tell about this?
[Peter then senses something]
Nick Fury: Parker? Parker!
Maria Hill: What's wrong?
Peter Parker: It's Beck. He's here.
[He puts his eyepiece back when the hologram starts to disappear, Maria Hill included. The facility is just an abandoned building.]
Nick Fury: (shocked) What? Hill?
Peter Parker: No, it's just an ill...
[A missile is fired from behind Peter, seemingly hitting and killing Fury]
Peter Parker: Fury!
[He looks back and sees one of the weaponized drones. It takes another shot, blasting Peter through the back wall, causing him to fall several floors down. Quentin Beck's voice, amplified, takes center stage. Peter gets surrounded by drones, all pointing lasers at him]
Quentin Beck (vo): Wow, Peter. Wow. I thought we were close. Fury always had to die. But not you.
Peter Parker: Stop hiding, Beck!
[Peter shoots some web at one of the drones but misses. Their cloaking devices activate and they disappear, while another illusion gets activated]
Quentin Beck (vo): I tried to help you walk away. Now you're making me do this… do this… do this…
[Everything goes dark. Peter, now in his original Tony Stark suit, looks in horror when lights fall down, revealing a school corridor covered in green smoke. Mysterio walks towards him]
Quentin Beck: You told me, you were just a kid.
[Peter shoots his web, but only green smoke sprays out of his hands. Mysterio is then suddenly behind him]
Quentin Beck: You told me...
[Peter punches him, only to reveal it's a brick pillar]
Quentin Beck (vo): ...you wanted to run after that girl.
MJ (vo): Help me!
Peter Parker: MJ!
[He runs through a door when he's suddenly on top of the Eiffel Tower. The door breaks loose and falls down. Peter looks to his right and sees MJ, confused and scared]
MJ: Peter? What's going on?
Peter Parker: I know this isn't real.
[Mysterio then materializes out of the full moon, grabbing MJ by her neck]
Quentin Beck: Do you, though?
Peter Parker: MJ!
[Mysterio throws her away, Peter dives after her]
Peter Parker: MJ!
[The illusion disappears. Peter hits the floor, MJ's screams still echoing through his head]
Quentin Beck (vo): I don't think you know what's real, Peter... [Echoing] Peter... Peter...
[Several buildings pass Peter at incredible speeds. One of the buildings, with a neon sign that says ""Queens"" above it, stops before him. Mysterio's gigantic fist then punches through it, sending Peter flying. He flies through the horizon, it shatters like glass. After falling through some webs, the illusion is briefly lifted]
Quentin Beck (vo): (distorted) You need to WAKE UP!
[Peter crashes on top of a car. He gets back on the ground, looking around, breathing anxiously. A dozen of drones then fly out of the windows of the building, the illusion continues. Huge shards of glass fall down, surrounding Peter]
Quentin Beck (vo): I mean, look at yourself.
[When Peter reaches out to touch one of his reflections, the reflection comes to life, grabbing his hand. Dozens of Spider-Men hurl themselves at Peter, pulling his suit away]
Quentin Beck (vo): You are just a scared little kid in a sweatsuit!
[The Spider-Men vanish, Peter is now in his homemade suit. He stands among the ruins of a Captain America statue, right in the center of the shield.]
Quentin Beck (vo): I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in.
[The camera focusses on a colossal Mysterio statue]
Quentin Beck (vo): I control the truth! [part of voice lowering down] Mysterio is the truth.
[Mysterio attacks, firing lasers at Spider-Man. He ducks away and grabs Mysterio with his web. He pulls, only for him to disappear, he had pulled a crane down. He avoids the crane, but not the stone arm that falls on top of him while he screams. Peter then stands by Anthony Edward Stark's grave. Yes, it's Tony's full name.]
Quentin Beck (vo): If you were good enough, (softer) maybe Tony would still be alive.
[A mechanized hand bursts out of the ground, trying to grab Peter, who scurries back in fear. The partially decomposed corpse of Tony Stark in an Iron Man suit crawls out of the grave and hovers up. We zoom in on the eye socket, a black widow spider crawls out of it, the eyes transform in several marching Mysterios]
Quentin Beck (echoing): Deep down, you know I'm right.
[Zoom in on one of the eyes on his costume. It opens and Spider-Man then finds himself in a gigantic snow globe, several buildings shoot out of the snow, surrounding him. We zoom out, the snow globe is Mysterio's head, who detaches it from his body]
Quentin Beck (vo): You made your choice, and all you had to do was step aside. And now, you ha-
[Bang! The illusion suddenly vanishes when Quentin, in his mo-cap outfit, falls on his knees. As he falls to the ground, Fury, who shot Quentin, limps towards Peter, who had been lying in a pile of sand. Several operatives drive onto the scene, get out of their cars and surround Beck]
Peter Parker: (crawling out of the sand) Fury!
Nick Fury: Beck's people... We're trying to find everyone who could expose him. Who'd you tell?
Peter Parker: Eh...
Nick Fury: I know you told someone. So, just tell me...
Peter Parker: Okay...
Nick Fury: Who did you tell? (raises his voice) Who else did you tell?!
Peter Parker: Just Ned and MJ from my class, and maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it.
[Nick chuckles and shakes his head.]
Peter Parker: What?
Nick Fury: You... are so gullible.
Peter Parker: What?
Nick Fury: I mean, you're smart as a whip. Just a... [in Quentin's voice]  ...sucker.
[The last piece of the illusion is lifted, Nick Fury was Beck the whole time]
Quentin Beck: And now all your friends have to die.
Peter Parker: Oh, my god!
[The two drones on Quentin's sides project a stream of illusions to scare Peter away]
Quentin Beck: It's easy to fool people when they're already fooling themselves. But for what it's worth, Peter... I really am sorry.
[The illusion stops. Peter, confused, gets hit by a train, which drives away into a tunnel]
Quentin Beck: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Yes, Quentin?
Quentin Beck: Access files to Peter Parker's class trip. I need them to fly home from London.
[Peter, dazed and bruised by the impact of the train, climbs on the train's side. He enters it and sits down in one of the seats before he falls unconscious.]
[Cut to black.]
[Peter Parker wakes up in a prison cell, an orange football shirt over his chest. He looks to his right to see a Dutch football hooligan]
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: Hi.
Peter Parker: (confused) Where am I?
[Another hooligan, sitting to Peter's left, answers]
Dutch Football Hooligan #2: Municipal holding facility.
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous.
Dutch Football Hooligan #3: We gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold.
Peter Parker: Thanks. You guys are nice. You speak really good English.
All Three: Welcome to the Netherlands.
Peter Parker: I'm in the Netherlands right now?
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: Yup.
[Peter stands up and runs to the cell door]
Peter Parker: (calling out) Guard?
Dutch Football Hooligan #1: The guard's on a break. Probably talking to his wife.
Dutch Football Hooligan #2: Yeah. She's pregnant.
Dutch Football Hooligan #3: (in Dutch) Oh ja? Wat leuk!
Dutch Football Hooligan #2: (responds in Dutch) Ja, vier weken al.
[Peter breaks the lock with his hand, opens the door and leaves the cell. One of the hooligans stands up and walks to the open door. Peter looks to his left to see the guard wearing the Night Monkey mask. He is indeed talking over the phone to someone]
Guard: Yeah. Yeah. Night Monkey. Yeah.
[Peter leaves the building, the guard directs his attention to the, no longer locked up, hooligans]
Guard: You guys okay?
[The hooligan closes the door. Peter, now outside on a rather stereotypical farmers market, puts the football shirt on. After stepping in something, he makes his way to a cheese farmer]
Peter Parker: Excuse me, sir? Can I borrow your phone?
Cheese Farmer: (in Dutch) Ja, zeker. 
[He hands Peter his phone]
Peter Parker: Everyone's so nice here.
[He thinks about who to call for a bit, before typing in Happy Hogan's cell]
Peter Parker: Okay... Pick up, pick up, pick up... Hey. Hey! Uh... I messed up. I need a... I need a ride. Where am I? Uh... where am I, sir?
Cheese Farmer: (in Dutch) Het is Broek op Langedijk.
[Peter, clearly having difficulty with Dutch pronunciation, asks the cheese farmer for another favor]
Peter Parker: Hang on, could you say that into there?
Cheese Farmer: Hi, it's Broek op Langedijk.
[Title card: Broek op Langedijk, Netherlands]
Cheese Farmer: Yeah, no problem.
Peter Parker: Thanks. (over the phone) Did you get that?
[CUT to a tulip field.]
[Peter is walking between rows of tulips, one pink and one yellow. A roaring sound as the Quinjet appears, landing in front of him as he staggers forward. A door opens and Happy walks down the stairs]
Happy Hogan: Peter? Are you okay?
Peter Parker: Happy, is that you?
Happy Hogan: Is it me? Yeah, of course, it's me!
[Peter hesitates, then halts]
Peter Parker: Stop! Tell me something only you would know!
Happy Hogan: Something only I would know. Uh. You-I-uh, remember when we went to Germany? You pay-for-viewed a video in your room? They didn't list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film at the front desk. And you didn't know how I knew-
Peter Parker: Okay! Okay! Fine, it's you, it's you, stop!
[They hug]
Peter Parker: It's so good to see you.
Happy Hogan: Peter, you're going to have to tell me what the hell is going on here.
[Happy is stitching up wounds in Peter's back, clearly causing pain]
Happy Hogan: Okay... hold still. Here we go.
[Peter visibly flinches]
Happy Hogan: I thought you had super strength.
Peter Parker: It still hurts.
Happy Hogan: All right, relax. Just a few more... there we go.
[Peter yells in pain and slams his fist on the table.]
Happy Hogan: Relax!
[Peter jumps up from his chair.]
Peter Parker: Don't tell me to relax, Happy! how can I relax when I've messed up so bad? I trusted Beck. Right? I thought he was my friend so I gave him the only thing that Mr. Stark left behind for me and now he's going to kill my friends and half of Europe, so please do not tell me to relax.
[He sits down, silent for a few moments.]
Peter Parker: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't shout. I just really miss him.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss him too.
Peter Parker: Everywhere I go, I see his face. And the whole world is asking who is going to be the next Iron Man and... I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.
Happy Hogan: You're not Iron Man. You're never going to be Iron Man. Nobody can live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did, he was all over the place. The one thing he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you. I don't think Tony would've done what he did... if he didn't know that you were going to be here after he was gone. Your friends are in trouble. You're all alone. The tech is missing. What are you gonna do about it?
[Peter stands, determined.]
Peter Parker: I'm gonna kick his ass.
Happy Hogan: No, I mean right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do? Because we've been hovering over a tulip field for the last fifteen minutes.
Peter Parker: Right, um... I can't call my friends because he's tracking their phones... uh, give me your phone?
[He walks over to Happy.]
Happy Hogan: My, my cell phone?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: Okay. Here.
Peter Parker: What's your password?
Happy Hogan: Password.
Peter Parker: No, what is your password?
Happy Hogan: Password. The word. Spell it out, password.
Peter Parker: You're the head of security and your password is 'password'?
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I don't feel good about it either.
[Peter has pulled up an app where Flash is vlogging.]
Flash Thompson, over the phone: Ello, governor! Cup of tea for you? I'mma be in London soon.
Peter Parker: They're in London.
Happy Hogan: London? Okay.
[He gets up, moving toward the front of the Quinjet]
Peter Parker: Yeah. I need a suit!
[Happy turns, a bit of a grin on his face.]
Happy Hogan: Suit?
[Happy turns again and walks forward, pressing some buttons on the ceiling. The Avengers theme makes a welcome cameo while a compartment opens behind Peter. The two turn and make eye contact, Peter smiling, then he turns back toward the compartment and moves toward it. Another small compartment opens as Peter stares at it. A small metal pad descends from a part of the ceiling, and Peter puts his hand on it. Blue lights appear, and he steps back.]
Peter Parker: Okay, um... bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.
[Holograms appear, and Peter scrolls through them as Happy watches.]
Peter Parker: Yeah, open that. Okay. No, no, no...
[He turns around with a holographic web shooter when he notices Happy watching him.]
Peter Parker: What?
Happy Hogan: Nothing. You take care of the suit, I take care of the music.
[Happy presses a few more buttons on the ceiling, the song Back in Black by AC/DC comes on.]
Peter Parker, tossing a wrench in the air: Oh, I love Led Zeppelin! 
[The plane takes off from the field of tulips, and Peter expands a hologram of the Spider-Man suit.]
Peter Parker: Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters? 
[A hologram of the web-shooter appears, and Peter pulls out a small part.]
Peter Parker: Isolate the taser webs and reconfigure and boost the voltage to a factor of... 25 percent. And with complete manual control over detonation.
[Scene cuts to Nick Fury and Maria Hill walking through the halls of a building.]
Nick Fury: I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top secret information.
Maria Hill: Nick... satellites are picking up an E.M. pulse.
Nick Fury: I thought that was over.
Maria Hill: It's the biggest one yet.
Nick Fury: Where?
Maria Hill: London.
[Cuts to the Decathlon team, walking through an airport.]
Mr. Harrington: Okay guys, the company set up a city tour, and then we'll grab a bite, then head to the airport.
Brad Davis: Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?
Mr. Dell: I get it. There's been nothing scientific about this science tour at all.
Brad Davis: No, no, no. I'm talking about Peter. Has no one else here noticed how shady he is? Because I saw him in a bathroom of a rest stop with some woman, in his underwear...
[Ned and MJ exchange glances.]
Brad Davis, continuing: ...and he's always sneaking away! Like back at the opera? Huh? And now what, he's suddenly off the trip? With his family in Berlin? Is no one else here interested in the truth?
[Ned lifts a hand, presumably about to talk, but MJ puts an arm in front of him.]
MJ: ""The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.""
Brad Davis: George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.
MJ: Yeah, well. I mean, since Peter's not here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad? Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?
Flash Thompson, clearly recording it: Yeah, dude. What's that about?
Brad Davis: No, no, it wasn't like that! It was... I was just trying to take...
Mr. Harrington: Let's just put all this craziness behind us, and have a nice, peaceful afternoon. ""Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"" said the class, okay...
[They leave, all except for Mr. Dell and Brad.]
Mr. Dell: I'm gonna be the cool teacher right now... you've got to stop doing that, okay? It is weird. No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls. Okay?
[Brad, defeated, wipes his nose as Mr. Dell walks away. Cut to the rest of the science team.]
Mr. Harrington: Look at this!
Bus Driver: Mr. Harrington. Come on.
Mr. Harrington: We've got a bus all to ourselves!
Bus Driver: Nice to see you all. Come along.
[Kids hand the man some backpacks. They go onto the bus. The driver, Guterman, presses a button on an earpiece in his ear.]
Guterman: I have the kids.
[Cut to Mysterio, flying around the city, before hovering outside a window in front of Nick Fury.]
Beck: I got here as fast as I could. I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.
Nick Fury: Damn it.
Maria Hill: Pulse is spiking.
[Beck turns to fly off.]
Quentin Beck: I'll take another look.
Nick Fury: Soon as you see something, report. You're all we got, Beck.
Quentin Beck: This is what I fear. May God help us, Fury.
[Cuts to Beck standing in his mocap suit, two drones hovering at his side.]
Quentin Beck: God, help us all.
[A dramatic pause.]
Quentin Beck: Okay, people, no Avengers coming. We're good to go. William, launch the drones.
William Ginther Riva: (behind a computer) Copy that, brother. Drones are entering the atmosphere, weapons hot.
[Cuts to a Stark satellite, releasing hundreds of drones.]
Quentin Beck: Excellent. Janice?
[Janice is steaming the tangible cape of Quentin]
Janice: Still working on the cape.
Quentin Beck: You gotta get those wrinkles out in a few hours. I could literally be shaking hands with the Queen. Guterman?
[Guterman drives the bus to a specific location]
Guterman: Almost in position.
Quentin Beck: Okay, hit it, Victoria.
Victoria: Increasing pulse.
[Cut to Maria Hill on her computer, watching the pulse.]
Maria Hill: Whatever this thing is, it's a hundred times bigger than the previous ones.
Quentin Beck: E.D.I.T.H.?
E.D.I.T.H.: Yes, Quentin.
Quentin Beck: Show me my loose ends.
[Holograms showing Nick Fury and Maria Hill show up, then switch to Betty Brant, MJ, and Ned.]
Quentin Beck: Once the show's going, execute a kill order on my command.
E.D.I.T.H.: Copy.

Quentin Beck: William, I've got drones breaking formation.
William: Well, maybe they hit a flock of birds or something. You're fine.
Quentin Beck: Well, I wanna see what's going on there. I'm taking manual control.
[From within the massive Elemental illusion, a drone turns around. From his wrist screen, Beck sees Peter webbing up the drones.]
William: (over radio) Do you see anything?
Quentin Beck: Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.
---This part is not finished. We will be pleased if you help us complete the transcript. :) - SpringsterR.317 (Minor Editor of fixers for the Marvel Transcripts)---
Quentin Beck: Kay, kill it, just kill the illusion, kill it...
William: No, I'm not gonna kill it, they'll see you!
Quentin Beck: They'll see what I want them to see!
Janice: Do you still need the cape?
Quentin Beck: Yes, Janice, I still need the cape.
[William clicks a button on his keyboard.]
William: Done.
[At the London Bridge, the illusion of Mysterio and the mega Elemental disappear.]
Quentin Beck: Now, William? Render my illusion suit.
William: Alright, hang on!
(The scene cuts to Happy inside the Quinjet holding a phone showing a video recording of Flash Thompson)
Flash Thompson (vo): The bombs have full of drones. It's crazy!
Happy Hogan: There you are.
(The Quinjet flies by to land in on a riverside.)
Happy Hogan: Easy.
(The Quinjet slowly lands to the ground.)
Quentin Beck: (noticing the Quinjet) Who the hell is that?
Happy Hogan: Ned!
Ned Leeds: Happy!
Happy Hogan: I got to get you guys out of here! Get on the jet!
MJ: Who are you?
Happy Hogan: I work with Spider-Man, okay? You got to get on that jet.
Flash Thompson: You work for Spider-Man?
Happy Hogan:I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man!
[the jet explodes after getting hit from drone's missiles]
Happy Hogan: New plan. Into the tower!
Peter Parker: Happy, are you okay?
Happy Hogan: Yeah. We're okay. Just go get Beck.

[Spider-Man has Beck right where he wants him, holding him in the air by the broken helmet]
Peter Parker: Your lies are over, Beck.
Quentin Beck: (not worried) This certainly isn't ideal, but... I have contingencies. E.D.I.T.H.?
[A drone shoots Peter to the other end of the corridor. Beck lands on his feet]
Peter Parker: (getting back up) Just give me the glasses.
[Beck pulls E.D.I.T.H. out of his motion-capture suit]
Quentin Beck: You want these? Come and get them.
[The drones activate their cloaking mechanism and the projection system. The corridor turns dack and green mist flows over the floor]
Peter Parker: (taking a deep breath) Come on, Peter-tingle.
[He closes his eyes and goes for it. He jumps all across the corridor, destroying drone after drone and coming closer and closer to the villain]
Quentin Beck: (while pressing buttons) Why aren't these drones firing?
E.D.I.T.H.: You're in the strike zone. The chance of getting hit...
Quentin Beck: (losing it) No, FIRE... ALL THE DRONES... NOOOOOOOOOW!
[The drones behind him fly forward and activate their weapons. Peter knocks his way through them. During the fight, one of the drones is spun around and Beck is hit in the chest by a rogue bullet. After all the drones are destroyed, Peter steps towards her former friend, taking off his mask]
Peter Parker: Beck! Beck... You lied to me. I trusted you.
Quentin Beck: I know. That's the most... disappointing part. You're a good person, Peter. Such a weakness...
[Quentin takes the glasses and hands them towards Peter]
Quentin Beck: Stark was right. You do deserve that.
[Peter grabs something to his right. BANG! He turns his head as the Quentin he'd been talking to vanishes. The real Quentin drops his gun, lightly spasming]
Peter Parker: You can't trick me anymore.
[Peter grabs the glasses off of Quentin's head as he falls to the ground]
Peter Parker: E.D.I.T.H., turn off the drones.
E.D.I.T.H.: Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter. Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?
Peter Parker: Do it. Execute them all.
E.D.I.T.H.: Confirmed.
[All the drones fly back up to the satellite. Maria Hill watches from afar. We briefly cut to the vault]
Happy Hogan: Give me the spear.
[While the weapon is passed over...]
Ned Leeds: That's a halberd.
[Back to Peter]
Peter Parker: Thank you.
[His face hardens as he turns to the dying Beck, lying on the ground]
Peter Parker: How could you do all of this?
Quentin Beck: (whispering) You'll see, Peter. People need to believe... And nowadays... they'll believe anything.
[The con man doesn't move anymore. He appears to be dead]
Peter Parker: (to E.D.I.T.H.) Is he... Is this real?
E.D.I.T.H.: All illusions are down, Peter.

[Mid-credits scene]
MJ: You can put me down now! You can put me down now!
[The two of them land in the middle of New York City]
Peter Parker: You okay?
[She stumbles back, lightly disoriented]
MJ: Whoo… Yeah! Yeah, I'm okay. Just.... Never, never doing that again. I'm never doing that again.
Peter Parker: Okay. Well, I should probably get out of here.
MJ: Be safe.
Peter Parker: See you later.
[Spider-Man jumps onto a nearby lamp post]
Voice: This is breaking news.
[The camera pans around the superhero towards an enormous television screen, showing a news broadcast]
Pat Kiernan: We come to you now with revelations about last week's attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video, it shows Quentin Beck, aka, Mysterio, moments before his death. A warning, you may find this video disturbing.
[Cut to altered footage of the Tower Bridge battle. Mysterio's theme plays in the background]
Mysterio: I managed to send the Elemental back into the dimensional rift, but I don't think I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive. Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology. He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.
[We're shown Quentin's death, but his superhero costume has been digitally added. The audio is different, too]
E.D.I.T.H.: Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be significant casualties.
Spider-Man: Do it! Execute them all!
[We hear the sound of drones firing and people screaming. While Peter and MJ watch, the newscaster comes back on screen]
Pat Kiernan: This shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website, 'TheDailyBugle.net.'
[Cut to J. Jonah Jameson on the news screen, played by the one and only J.K. Simmons]
J. Jonah Jameson: There you have it, folks. Conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio! An inter-dimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet, and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. But that's not all, folks. Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves, you might wanna sit down.
[Cut back to altered footage of the Tower Bridge battle]
Quentin Beck: Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is... Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker!
[Peter's school picture fills the screen. Cut to Peter]
Peter Parker: (horrified) WHAT THE F-
[The credits go by with Michael Giacchino's killer score behind them. Once they've finished, we cut to a car being driven by Nick Fury, with Maria Hill sitting next to him. Their eyes briefly meet, before Maria Hill transforms into a Skrull, Soren, last seen in Captain Marvel]
Soren: You've got to tell him.
[Nick Fury transforms into Talos, also from Captain Marvel]
Talos: (trying to comfort his wife) It was fine. The little boy handled it, we helped...
Soren: Talos.
Talos: (annoyed) Come on, Soren, how was I supposed to know the whole thing was fake? I mean, that was all very, very convincing, you know. The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that. I mean, this is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine!
[While driving, he pulls out a smartphone to contact Fury. During the call, we see Talos in a POV shot, mimicking a phone camera]
Talos: Hey there. I hope your mission is going well. We gave the glasses to Parker, about a week ago, like you said. And, uh, it was very touching, you know? Really, really quite touching.
Soren (vo): Talos.
Talos: And, uh, you know, shortly after that, everything kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back. Because everyone kept asking me where the Avengers are, and I don’t know what to say to that.
[We cut to the real Nick Fury, resting on a beach, lying in a chair with a coconut drink next to him]
Talos: So, you’re lucky-
[Nick ends the call. He gets up and stretches out while the beach disappears, merely a hologram. He leaves a room, revealing that he is on a spaceship with several Skrulls. He walks to a huge window, showing the immensity of space]
Nick Fury: (claps his hands) Everybody, back to work! Who's got my shoes?
[The last message shows a ""dedicated to"" message for Spider-Man's creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. After that, the movie ends]

 Iron Man
 Iron Man 2

[SHORT VERSION - IF scrolling is too long]
     
Is it ready?
Hey! That's a great punch.
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.
Breathe. Breathe.
Wait.
Okay.
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...
Okay. Okay.
Shut that off! Turn it off!
Watch out!
Okay!
That's not right.
Oh, you.
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.
Damn it!
Here's something
a bit more interesting.
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.
Wow.
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.
And I pulled you one ace.
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.
Glad I could help. Just make it good.
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,
but live fire is for backup only.
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.
Is he a fighter?
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government
who stole military secrets.
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!
Tranq him and bring him back.
Oh, come on.
Camera.
Here we go.
Get rid of the damn dog.
Take him!
Target's on the move.
Where is he?
He's on the ground.
- Let's go!
- Go!
Move, move!
Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
Clear everyone out!
Do not lose him!
Oh! No!
Get around behind him!
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.
Oh, no.
You got to be kidding me.
- Where is he?
- Target acquired.
Gringo!
Let's go.
No!
Please! No!
Not the computer!
Gimme that! No!
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.
Oh, no.
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!
Anybody else seeing this?
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!
Do it now!
Go live! Go live! Go live!
Move!
- Get out of the way!
No!
It's behind us! Move! Move!
Get him!
Shoot!
Leave me alone.
No! No!
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.
He had it on him when he bolted.
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?
She is no longer a factor.
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.
Forgive me, sir?
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...
He didn't lose us.
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.
And then something hit us, something...
Something big hit us!
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.
Well, it's gone.
Well, if Banner knows what it is,
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.
It
was Banner.
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.
You've done a good job.
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.
Wait.
Please.
Where am I?
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.
I've seen good men go down
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?
I mean, that's the job.
But this?
This is a whole new level of weird.
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,
because if that thing shows up again,
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.
Sir.
Tienes ms stretchy?
Yeah. Perfecto.
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Yeah, Super Soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.
We were tryin' to make you better.
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him
what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong.
Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed
was very promising.
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.
He is not one of us.
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
So get out of the trenches.
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.
I could probably arrange
something like that.
Take care, kids.
Stan, I give you my word,
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.
- Have you talked to her?
- No.
She doesn't know that I'm here.
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.
Good. That's good.
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.
There is one other thing.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.
I don't think there's anybody up there.
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.
All right.
Okay.
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.
Oh, kids.
I got nothing but marinara now.
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.
She worked through dinner again,
of course.
Stan?
And he... I go, ""So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?
""I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil.""
And he goes, ""Not where you been at.""
I thought, ""Oh, my God."" I just felt so awful.
Bruce?
Betty? What's going on?
Betty...
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.
Don't go. Don't go.
I want you to come with me now.
Please. Come with me.
Please.
It's our data.
I got in there before they carted it all away.
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
You have to be sure.
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.
He wants to make it a weapon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.
Really? You can't stay at all?
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.
I need to take a bus.
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.
Okay.
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.
I...
What?
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope you get some rest.
We're giving you a very low dose only.
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.
First sign of any side effect,
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
You'll get two separate infusions.
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
Is everything okay?
I think so.
Come here.
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?
It feels too tight, huh?
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.
- What?
- They're here.
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!
You have to go far away
from me as you can!
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.
I wanna know who jumped the gun.
He's heading 2-7-0.
Blonsky! Not yet!
Sir.
Look alive. This could get interesting.
I got him!
Stop! Stop!
I know you're in there!
General, please!
Sir?
Dad!
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.
There he is!
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!
He's locked in.
Put two canisters in there with him.
Fire!
Get her back here!
Now she'll see.
Alpha team?
Let him have all of it.
Come on, light him up!
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!
Oh, my God!
Blonsky, now you're up!
Sir?
Cover me.
Remember me?
My God, he's doing it.
Move him toward the cannons!
Move!
Hold your position!
Do it now!
Please, please, please, no!
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!
You're killing him!
Stop! Get off of me!
Bruce!
Bruce! Bruce!
Where's the gunship?
Is that it?
Blonsky, pull back now.
Pull back!
Is that all you got?
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!
Find cover!
Betty!
Fire, goddamn it!
Bruce?
Stop firing!
No!
You did the right thing, calling us.
I need to know where they're going.
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.
From who?
He protected her. You almost killed her.
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.
And you are.
I don't know where he's going.
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.
And I can't help either one of them.
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.
Now I know!
Where does she meet these guys?
Bruce?
Bruce.
It's okay. It's okay.
Come here. Come this way.
Watch your head.
Okay.
We're okay.
It's okay.
It's just the rain.
Will he ever walk again?
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.
Here.
Okay.
Bruce?
Oh, hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.
You ate it?
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.
Wow.
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.
First thing's first.
Oh, you're kidding me.
What?
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.
I'll take my chances.
Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash
between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary
on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.
It was so big.
- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.
McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,
captured this on his cell phone.
Further search for the mysterious ""hulk""
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.
Not too short back there.
I have done this before, you know.
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.
With clippers, usually.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?
We can't do this.
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.
No.
I can't.
I can't get too excited.
Not even a little excited?
It's okay.
Sir, it's Blonsky.
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?
Ask him yourself.
Sir?
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
How do you feel?
Pissed off and ready for round three.
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.
And we'll take the cash, obviously.
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?
Well, we could sell this.
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.
Federal is
already monitoring phones,
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,
and local PD have been placed on alert.
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.
They're not gonna just pop up.
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.
He's not trying to escape this time.
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.
You all have copies of the correspondence.
The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.
Hey.
Smile.
What is it like?
When it happens, what do you experience?
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?
Those induced hallucinations?
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.
Maybe your mind is in there,
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.
Are you ready?
Let's even the playing field a little.
Gentlemen.
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.
All right. Come.
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?
Right. Let's get a cab.
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Are you out of your mind?
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?
Asshole!
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.
Okay.
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.
Oh! Dr Ross!
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?
Mr Green?
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.
And if you were, what would it look like?
A person with that much
power lurking in him.
Nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.
Even if everything goes perfectly,
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,
this will be very dangerous for you.
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?
How you feeling, man?
Like a monster.
Okay. On the table.
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.
Okay...
You, you, you.
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.
We have begun.
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.
Just relax.
Okay. We are comprehensive.
Here you go.
All right. We set to pop?
I'd take your hands off him.
Oh, my God!
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.
Now, do it! Do it!
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Bruce.
Oh, my God.
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?
Bruce?
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.
You did it.
He's fine. This is fantastic.
It's over.
Hi.
Hi.
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,
or maybe we just suppressed that event.
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?
What test subjects?
Come with me.
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.
We started on rats and mice,
but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!
This is potentially Olympian!
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.
We will make humans
impervious to disease!
No, no, we've got to destroy it.
- Wait, what?
- All of it.
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...
We could get the Nobel for this!
You don't understand
the power of this thing.
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.
At your discretion, shooter.
three of us!
This is Promethean fire!
It's just...
No shot.
Blonsky's going in.
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!
We have the antidote now.
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.
You don't know how powerful this thing is.
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?
Bruce! Bruce!
Get out.
Where is it? Come on, where is it?
Show him to me.
Blonsky!
Miss!
Take this.
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.
Betty.
I will never forgive what you've done to him.
He's a fugitive.
You made him a fugitive
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!
So Banner's the only...
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?
I have.
And it's beautiful.
Godlike.
Well, I want that.
I need that. Make me that.
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.
The mix could be
an abomination.
I didn't say I was unwilling.
I just need informed consent.
And you've given it.
This is what I was trying to explain.
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.
But clearly it worked.
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,
but if you'll just get back on the table,
I can fix this.
Shoot it!
- Hey!
No!
Delta 4 to Leader.
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!
Come on! Move, move, move, move!
It's over there!
Drop them!
What is that thing?
- Shoot it!
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!
Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
Something big
just went off down here!
General, you should hear this!
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.
You get it together. What is your position?
Turn us around.
We're going back. Why are we going back?
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!
Yes, sir!
What the hell was that?
Go, go, go!
No!
One of yours?
Oh, my God. What have you done?
Fire at him, fire at him!
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?
Come on!
Sweet.
Booyah!
Get out of there, soldier!
Stacy!
Give me a real fight!
Sir?
Sir?
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.
What are you saying?
You think you can control it?
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.
And what if you can't?
We made this thing.
All of us.
Please.
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.
Open the back door.
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!
Betty, I've got to try.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit!
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.
There. Betty!
Hulk!
Yeah!
Come on!
Is that all you've got?
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!
Which one?
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?
Cut the other one in half!
Ross!
Keep it on him!
Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!
Dad?
Are you hurt? Let me help you.
I'm all right. Just find a way out.
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!
Look out!

Abomination: [About to kill Ross with a huge chain] General…any last words?
Hulk: [rouses] HULK… SMASH!! [smashes the ground]

Stop!
It's okay.
Betty.

[General Ross sulks at a bar]
General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: [Drinks shot] Reload. [barkeep gets another shot; Ross chugs the shot] Reload.
Shadowy Figure: [Approaches Ross] Mmmm, the smell of stale beer and defeat. Y'know, I hate to say ""I told you so,"" General, but that Super-Soldier program was put on ice for a reason. [Appears as Tony Stark] I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.
Ross: Stark.
Stark: General.
Ross: You always wear such nice suits.
Stark: Touché. I hear you have an unusual problem.
Ross: You should talk.
Stark: You should listen. [the General leans in a bit as Stark whispers] What if I told you we were putting a team together?
Ross: Who's ""we""?
[Stark clears his throat, looks at the General, and smiles.]


Major Kathleen ""Kat"" Sparr: Here's something interesting. Possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee. Man drank one of those guarana sodas…guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for.
[cut to a man opening his fridge, reaching for a soda, opening it and drinking]
Milwaukee Man: Wow!
[he starts choking and falls unconscious]


[after Blonsky's mission to Brazil to recapture Banner goes awry]
Emil Blonsky: Forgive me, sir, but…doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? Because he didn't lose us. And he was not alone, sir. We had him, but then something hit us. Something BIG hit us! It threw a forklift truck like it was a SOFTBALL! It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.
Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: Well, it's gone.
Blonsky: Well, if Banner knows what it is, I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat, and I'm gonna—
Ross: That was Banner. It was Banner.
Blonsky: [understandably confused] You'll have to explain that, sir.
Ross: No, I don't. You've done a good job. Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home.


[Ross briefs Blonsky about Banner]
Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: You must realize what I'm about to tell you is very sensitive, both to me and the Army. You know that we have a Bio-Force Department, and that we had a bio-force enhancement project developed during World War II.
Emil Blonsky: A super-soldier.
Gen. Ross: A simplification, but yes. We decided to dust it off and give it another go, aiming to create a better soldier. Banner’s work was very early phase. It wasn’t even weapons application. He thought he was working on radiation resistance. I would never have told him what the project really was. But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself. And something went very wrong…or it went very right. As far as I’m concerned, that man’s whole body is property of the U.S. Army.
Blonsky: You said he wasn’t working on weapons, right?
Ross: No.
Blonsky: But you were. You were, weren’t you? You were trying other things.
Ross: One serum we developed…was very promising.
Blonsky: So why did he run?
Ross: He’s a scientist. He is not one of us.


Betty Ross: Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just walk in and talk to my father.
Bruce Banner: He told me what he was gonna do. He wants it out of me. He wants to dissect it so he can replicate it. He wants to make it a weapon.


Betty: What is it like? When it happens, what do you experience?
Bruce: Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard? Those induced hallucinations? It’s a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified. It’s like someone poured a liter of acid into my brain.
Betty: Do you remember anything?
Bruce: Just fragments. Images. There’s too much noise, I can never derive anything out of it.
Betty: But then, it’s still you, inside of it—
Bruce: No. No, it’s not.
Betty: I don’t know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me. Maybe your mind is in there, it’s just overcharged and can’t process what’s happening-
Bruce: I don’t want to control it. I want to get rid of it.


[after Blonsky has every bone in his body shattered during a fight with the Hulk]
Major Kathleen ""Kat"" Sparr: Sir, Blonsky…
Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: [expecting the worst] Does anyone know if he had any next-of-kin or family?
Sparr: Ask him yourself.
Emil Blonsky: [in perfect health, salutes Ross] Sir!


General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: Betty…
Betty Ross: I will never forgive what you’ve done to him.
Gen. Ross: He’s a fugitive.
Betty: You made him a fugitive. To cover your failures, and to protect your career. Don’t ever speak to me as your daughter again.
Gen. Ross: It’s only because you’re my daughter that you’re not in handcuffs too!


[General Ross meets with Betty's boyfriend]
Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: You did the right thing contacting us. Leonard, I need to know where they're going. She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.
Leonard Samson: From who? He protected her, you almost killed her.
Ross: I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.
Leonard: You know, it's a point of professional pride for me that I can tell when somebody's lying. And you are. I don't know where he's going. I know she'll help him if she can.
Ross: Then she's aiding a fugitive. And I can't help either one of them. [walks off]
Leonard: I used to wonder why she never talked about you. Now I know.
Ross: [to himself] Where does she meet these guys?


Major Kathleen ""Kat"" Sparr: Are you telling me you can make more like him?
Dr. Samuel Sterns: No, not yet! I've sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking. He was a freak accident, the goal is to do it better!
Sparr: So Banner was the only—wait—[Knocked unconscious]
Emil Blonsky: Aah, she's an annoying bitch, isn't she?
Sterns: Why are you always hitting people?! [Blonsky pulls out his gun and points it at Dr. Sterns] Now what…could I have possibly done…to deserve such aggression?
Blonsky: [mumbling agitatedly] It's not what you've done, it's what you're gonna do. [Dr. Sterns raises his head, interested] I want what you've got off Banner, I want that.
Sterns: [rising] You look like…you've got a little something in you already, don't you?
Blonsky: Yeah, well, I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?
Sterns: I have…and it's beautiful. Godlike.
Blonsky: I want that…I need that. Make me that.
Sterns: I don't know what you've got inside you already. The mixture could become…an abomination. [Blonsky grabs Dr. Sterns by the collar and raises him into the air] I didn't say I was unwilling…I just need informed consent…and you've given it!


[in New York City]
Betty Ross: The subway is probably quickest.
Bruce Banner: Me? In a metal tube, deep underground with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?
Betty: …right, let's get a cab.
 . . .
[one very stressful cab ride later]
Betty: [kicking the cab door as she gets out] Asshole!
Bruce: You know, I know a few techniques that could help you manage that anger effectively—
Betty: You zip it! We're walking.
Bruce: …okay.


Abomination: [About to kill Ross with a huge chain] General…any last words?
Hulk: [rouses] HULK…SMASH!! [smashes the ground]"

FADE IN:

         On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
         with a billion stars.
         Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
         BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
         breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

         1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

         A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
         amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
         down the street and heads out of town.

         2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

         The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
         of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
         variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
         at the sky.
         JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
         positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
         constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
         spare parts of other devices.

                        JANE
         Hurry!
         We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
         Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
         well, rubbing his head.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Oh-- watch your head.

                        SELVIG
         Thanks. So what's this ""anomaly""
         of yours supposed to look like?

                        JANE
         It's a little different each time.
         Once it looked like, I don't know,
         melted stars, pooling in a corner
         of the sky. But last week it was a
         rolling rainbow ribbon--

                        SELVIG

                        (GENTLY TEASING)
         ""Racing ""˜round Orion?"" I've always
         said you should have been a poet.
         Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.

                        JANE
         Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
         my gloves, will you?
         Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
         a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
         Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
         and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
         foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Not until you see it!

                        SELVIG
         (re: the gloves)
         I recognize those. Think how proud
         he'd be to see you now.
         Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

                        JANE
         Thank you.

                        SELVIG
         For what?

                        JANE
         The benefit of the doubt.
         The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
         they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         It's never taken this long before.
         Darcy calls up from the front seat.

         DARCY (O.S.)
         Can I turn on the radio?

                        JANE
         (an edge to her voice)
         Sure, if you like rocking out to
         KFRM, ""All agriculture, all the
         time.""
         Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

         3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

         The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
         equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
         together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
         handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
         frustrated Jane with sympathy.

                        JANE
         The anomalies are always
         precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
         She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
         tracking occurrences and patterns.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         The last seventeen occurrences have
         been predictable to the minute... I
         just don't understand.
         Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
         She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
         the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

                        DARCY
         Jane?
         Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
         champagne begins to vibrate.

                        JANE
         There's got to be some new
         variable... Or an equipment
         malfunction...
         The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
         them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.

                        DARCY
         I don't think there's anything
         wrong with your equipment...
         The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
         shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
         They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
         the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
         everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

         DARCY (CONT'D)
         Jane?

                        JANE
         What?!

                        DARCY
         I think you want to see this.
         Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
         the desert --

         MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
         Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

                        JANE
         Holy. Shatner.

                        SELVIG
         That's your ""subtle"" aurora?!

                        JANE
         No-- yes! Let's go!

         4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

         The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
         event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
         out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
         The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
         her, yanks her back in.

         5 INT. SUV 5

         Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

                        JANE
         Isn't this great?!
         A thought strikes her.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         You're seeing it too, right? I'm
         not crazy?

                        SELVIG
         That's debateable. Put your seat
         belt on!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
         The SUV lurches.

         6 EXT. DESERT 6

         Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
         out of the clouds comes --

         AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
         Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
         thousand freight trains as it touches down.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.

         7 INT. SUV 7

         Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
         enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
         into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
         window, TAPING the storm.

                        JANE
         You've gotta get us closer so I can
         take a magnetic reading.
         Darcy laughs.

                        DARCY
         Yeah, right! Good one!
         (then, realizing)
         Oh God, you're serious...

                        JANE
         You want those college credits or
         not?

         8 EXT. SUV 8

         The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
         leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
         two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
         take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
         strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
         them with a terrifying intensity.

         9 INT. SUV 9

         The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
         the wheel, starts to head away.

                        DARCY
         Keep the credits. I'll intern at
         Burger King.

                        JANE
         What are you doing?!

                        DARCY
         Saving our lives!
         Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
         struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

                        A MAN







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
         Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
         slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
         The SUV swerves -- but too late.

         10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

         The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
         him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

         11 INT. SUV 11

         Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
         They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
         A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

         12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12

         The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
         man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
         charred and blackened.

                        DARCY
         I think that was legally your
         fault.

                        JANE
         Get the first aid kit.
         Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
         next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
         She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
         clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
         long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
         features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
         the life back into him.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
         and don't be dead, okay? Open your
         eyes and look at me.
         Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
         his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
         azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
         them.
         For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
         The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
         freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.

                        DARCY
         Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
         know CPR.
         A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
         She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

                        JANE

                        HIS EYES--

                        DARCY

                        (DREAMILY)
         --are beautiful.

                        JANE
         --are dilating. That's a good
         sign.

                        SELVIG
         We still have to get him to a
         hospital.

                        JANE

                        (HOPEFULLY)
         After we get a reading on the
         storm?

                        SELVIG
         Immediately, Jane.
         Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
         above their heads. A thought strikes her.

                        JANE
         Where did he come from?
         They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
         glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

         13 EXT. SPACE 13

         EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
         resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

         HEIMDALL (V.O.)
         Questions, they've always asked
         questions -- this race called man,
         on this planet they call earth.
         Passionately longing to know how
         they are connected to the heavens.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
         We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
         cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
         galaxy.

         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
         In ages past, they looked to us as
         gods, for indeed so many times we
         saved them from calamity. We tried
         to show them how their world was
         but one of the Nine Realms of the
         Cosmos, linked to all others by the
         branches of Yggdrasil...
         We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
         sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
         shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
         out into the black void of space.

         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
         ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
         a universe of wonder, beauty, and
         terror that they barely
         comprehended.
         We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
         a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
         But for all their thirst for
         knowledge, they let our lessons
         fall into myth and dreams.
         Where did he come from? He came
         from us, the proudest race of
         warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
         He came from this -- the greatest
         Realm the universe has ever known.
         We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
         over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
         what's on the other side:

         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
         He came... from Asgard!

         14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

         Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
         landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
         modern yet timeless.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.

         15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

         The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
         other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
         out before it.
         We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

                        STANDS --







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.

                        ODIN ALLFATHER
         Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
         land at his side.

         16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

         Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
         vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

                        ODIN
         Do you think he's ready?

                        FRIGGA
         He thinks he is. He has his
         father's confidence.

                        ODIN
         He'll need his father's wisdom.

                        FRIGGA
         And his humility?
         Odin reacts.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
         at his side to give him counsel.
         Have faith in your sons.

                        ODIN
         Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
         could be a great King...
         Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
         synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
         as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
         trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
         sheer will.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
         Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
         A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

         ODIN (CONT'D)

                        (QUIETLY)
         ...if we only had more time.

                        FRIGGA
         For once, our son needs something
         we cannot provide.

                        ODIN
         I can fight it a little longer...

                        FRIGGA
         No. You've put it off too long! I
         worry for you.
         He touches her cheek.

                        ODIN
         I've destroyed demons and monsters,
         devastated whole worlds, laid waste
         to mighty kingdoms, and still you
         worry for me?

                        FRIGGA
         Always.

                        ODIN
         Not today. Now come kiss your
         king... while I'm still king.
         He pulls her close, and they kiss.

         17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

         Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
         hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
         fire lit room.
         Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
         against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
         recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
         Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
         An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
         He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
         below.

                        THOR
         Another!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
         The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
         intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
         length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
         He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
         the Hall.
         We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
         shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
         horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
         from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
         horned headpiece.
         Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
         a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
         throne room.

                        LOKI

                        (TO THOR)
         Nervous, brother?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.

                        THOR
         Have you ever known me to be
         nervous?

                        LOKI
         There was the time in Nornheim...

                        THOR
         That wasn't nerves, brother. It
         was the rage of battle. How else
         could I have fought my way through
         a hundred warriors and pulled us
         out alive?
         The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
         Thor.

                        LOKI
         As I recall, I was the one who
         veiled us in smoke to ease our
         escape.

                        THOR
         Some do battle, others just do
         tricks.
         The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
         it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
         EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
         across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
         goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Loki...
         Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
         back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Now that was just a waste of good
         wine.

                        LOKI
         Just a bit of fun.
         (to the Attendant)
         Right, my friend?
         The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED

         HELMET.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         (re: Thor's helmet)
         Nice feathers.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.

                        THOR
         You don't really want to start this
         again, do you, Cow?

                        LOKI
         I was being sincere!

                        THOR
         You're incapable of sincerity.

                        LOKI
         Am I?
         He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         I've looked forward to this day as
         long as you have. You're my
         brother and my friend. Sometimes
         I'm envious, but never doubt that I
         love you.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
         Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
         He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
         liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
         brother's shoulder.

                        THOR
         Thank you.
         The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

                        LOKI
         Give us a kiss.

                        THOR
         Stop.
         Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         How do I look?

                        LOKI
         Like a king.
         They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         It's time.

                        THOR
         You go ahead.
         Loki casts him a wary look.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         I'll be along. Go on.
         Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

         17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A

         VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
         event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
         stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
         eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
         FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
         moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
         holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
         dreamily.

                        FANDRAL
         Thank you, love.
         (to the Maidens)

                        (MORE)







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.

                        FANDRAL (CONT'D)
         Now who'd like to polish my sword
         for me?
         The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
         HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
         of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
         the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
         ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
         Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
         Attendant quickly backs away.
         From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
         SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
         HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
         reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
         on the table.

                        SIF
         (to the weapons)
         I'll miss you.

         18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

         Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
         room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
         Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
         Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
         the front of the hall. They are:

         THE WARRIORS THREE
         VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
         oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
         swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
         HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
         side.
         With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
         a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
         with.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.

                        VOLSTAGG
         I hope this goes quickly. I'm
         famished.

                        FANDRAL

                        (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
         Noooo!

                        VOLSTAGG
         Are you attached to that pretty
         face of yours? Because one more
         word, and you won't be.

                        FANDRAL
         (to the others)
         My, we are hungry, aren't we?
         The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
         Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
         it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
         Just one smile.
         Hogun stares at him grimly.

         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
         All right, half a smile. Look,
         forget the smile, just show some
         teeth.

                        SIF
         Fandral, is it true the famous
         Warriors Three are ready to meet
         any challenge?

                        FANDRAL
         Name it, Lady Sif.

                        SIF
         Keep your mouth shut.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12.

         19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19

         Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
         stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
         the palace.
         A cold BREEZE blows past them.

         19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A

         Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
         hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

                        FRIGGA
         It's all right to be nervous.

                        THOR
         Why does everyone keep saying that?
         I'm not nervous!

                        FRIGGA
         You may be able to fool the rest of

                        ASGARD --

                        THOR
         ...but never you. I know.

                        FRIGGA
         Thor, just remember that you have
         something even the great Allfather
         never had.

                        THOR
         And what is that?

                        FRIGGA
         Me for a mother.
         She smiles.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         Now don't keep your father waiting.
         Frigga leaves.

         20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20

         Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
         and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
         hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
         the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
         formation. They part to reveal --

                        ODIN







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
         Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
         holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
         him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
         Ruler of Asgard.
         Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
         casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
         seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
         A murmur spreads through the crowd.

                        VOLSTAGG
         (sotto, to Loki)
         Where is he?

                        LOKI
         He said he'd be along.
         Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

                        VOLSTAGG
         What?

                        SIF
         He wants to make an entrance.

                        FANDRAL
         Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
         he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
         like he's ready to feed him to his
         ravens.

                        LOKI
         I wouldn't worry. Father will
         forgive him. He always does.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
         Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
         lower level --

                        MJOLNIR
         Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
         behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
         CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
         before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
         adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

                        SIF
         Oh, please.
         Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

         21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21

         As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
         breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
         warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
         something's not right.
         They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
         hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
         pedestal.
         LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
         SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

         22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

         Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
         of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
         Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
         her. She can't help but smile.
         Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
         The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
         authority.
         He raises Gungnir before him.

                        ODIN
         Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
         power strong. With it I have
         defended Asgard and the lives of
         the innocent across the Nine Realms
         since the time of the Great
         Beginning. And though the day has
         come for a new King to wield his
         own weapon -- that duty remains the
         same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
         first-born.

                        ODIN (CONT'D)
         So long entrusted with this mighty
         hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
         heart of a dying star, from the
         sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
         lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
         wields this hammer commands the
         lightning and the storm. Its power
         has no equal -- as a weapon, to
         destroy, or as a tool, to build.
         It is a fit companion for a King.

         23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23

         The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
         strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
         catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
         and BLUE-SKINNED.
         One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
         to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
         Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
         standing in the shadows behind it.
         As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
         They turn back around.
         Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

         24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24

         The Ceremony continues.

                        ODIN
         Today I entrust you with the
         greatest honor in all the Nine
         Realms. The sacred throne of
         Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
         achieve peace. So, too, must a new
         generation sacrifice to maintain
         that peace. Responsibility, duty,
         honor. These are not merely
         virtues to which we must aspire.
         They are essential to every soldier
         and to every King.
         The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
         their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
         hall.
         Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
         with pride.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
         the Nine Realms?

                        THOR
         I swear.

                        ODIN
         Do you swear to preserve the peace?

                        THOR
         I swear.

                        ODIN
         Do you swear to cast aside all
         selfish ambition and pledge
         yourself only to the good of all
         the Realms?
         Beat.

                        THOR
         I swear.

                        ODIN
         Then on this day, I, Odin
         Allfather, proclaim you--
         Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
         creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
         hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
         and the crowd see it too.

         ODIN (CONT'D)

                        (REALIZING)
         Frost giants...
         The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
         palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
         weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

         25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B

         Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
         Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
         stop short.
         Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
         We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
         clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
         remains on the floor.
         They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
         Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
         creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
         It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

                        SIF
         The Destroyer.

                        VOLSTAGG

                        (AWED)
         I thought it was but a legend.
         Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
         the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
         the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
         Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

                        FANDRAL
         I've never been inside the Vault
         before. It's said the Tesseract
         was once held here.

                        VOLSTAGG

                        (AWED)
         The Tesseract? I thought that was
         but a legend too!

                        SIF
         Shush!
         Odin surveys the destruction.

                        THOR
         The Jotuns must pay for what
         they've done!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.

                        ODIN
         They have paid with their lives.
         The Destroyer did its job, and the
         Casket is safe. All is well.

                        THOR
         ""All is well?!"" They broke into
         the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
         Giants had stolen even one of these

                        RELICS--

                        ODIN
         But they didn't.

                        THOR
         I want to know why they--

                        ODIN

                        (INTERRUPTING)
         The Casket of Ancient Winters
         belonged to the Jotuns. They
         believe it's their birthright.

                        THOR
         And if you hadn't taken it from
         them they would have laid waste to
         all the Nine Realms!

                        ODIN
         I have a truce with Laufey, the
         Jotun King.

                        THOR
         He just broke your truce! We must
         act!
         Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

                        ODIN
         Leave us.
         Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         And what action would you take?

                        THOR
         March into Jotunheim as you once
         did, teach them a lesson, break
         their spirits so they'll never dare
         try to cross our borders again!

                        ODIN
         You're thinking only as a warrior!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B.

                        THOR
         This was an act of war!

                        ODIN
         It was the act of but a few, doomed
         to fail.

                        THOR
         They got this far!

                        ODIN
         We will find the breach in our
         defenses. It will be found, and it
         will be sealed.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.

                        THOR
         As King of Asgard, I would--

                        ODIN
         You are not King. Not yet.
         Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
         as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
         doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
         watches him go.

         26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26

         Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
         festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
         and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
         massive tables.
         From across the room, Loki watches him.

         AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
         Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
         search of his dinner.

                        SIF
         Redecorating, are we?
         Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.

                        VOLSTAGG
         What's this -- ?!

                        HOGUN
         I told you they'd cancel it.

                        FANDRAL
         We thought that was just you being
         your normal cheery self.
         Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.

                        VOLSTAGG
         All this food -- so innocent, cast
         to the ground. It breaks the
         heart!
         Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
         calmly moves towards him.

                        THOR
         It's unwise to be in my company
         right now, brother.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.

                        LOKI
         Who said I was wise?

                        THOR
         (re: the empty hall)
         This was to be my day of triumph.

                        LOKI
         It will come. In time.

                        (ADMITS)
         If it's any consolation, I think
         you're right. About the Frost
         Giants, about Laufey, everything.
         If a few of them could penetrate
         the defenses of Asgard once, who's
         to say they won't try again. Next
         time with an army?

                        THOR
         Yes, exactly!

                        LOKI
         But there's nothing we can do
         without defying Father.
         Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
         Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         No... stop there! I know that
         look!

                        THOR
         It's the only way to ensure the
         safety of our borders.

                        LOKI
         It's madness!

                        VOLSTAGG
         Madness? What sort of madness?

                        LOKI
         Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

                        THOR
         The safety of our Realm is no jest.
         We're going to Jotunheim.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19.

                         FANDRAL
         What?!

                         SIF
         Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
         this is one you must not break.
         Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.

                        FANDRAL
         This isn't like a journey to Earth,
         where you summon a little lightning
         and thunder and the mortals worship
         you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

                        VOLSTAGG
         And if the Frost Giants don't kill
         you, your Father will!

                        THOR
         My father fought his way into
         Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
         and took their Casket! We'd just
         be looking for answers.

                        SIF
         It is forbidden!
         Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
         case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.

                        THOR
         My friends, have you forgotten all
         that we've done together?
         He turns to Fandral.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Who brought you into the sweet
         embrace of the most exotic maidens
         in all of Yggdrasil?

                        FANDRAL
         You did.

                        THOR

                        (TO HOGUN)
         Who led you into the most glorious
         of battles...

                        (TO VOLSTAGG)
         ...and to delicacies so succulent,
         you thought you'd died and gone to
         Valhalla?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.

                        VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
         You did. / You did.
         He turns to Sif.

                        THOR
         And who proved wrong all who
         scoffed at the idea that a young
         maiden could be one of the fiercest
         warriors this Realm has ever known?

                        SIF
         I did.

                        THOR

                        (QUICKLY)
         True. But I supported you...
         (then, to the others)
         My friends, trust me now. We must
         do this.
         The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
         convincing him.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Come on. You're not going to let
         my brother and me take all the
         glory, are you?
         Loki looks startled.

                        LOKI
         What?

                        THOR
         You are coming with me...

                        LOKI
         Yes, of course! I won't let my
         brother march into Jotunheim alone.
         I will be at his side.

                        VOLSTAGG
         And I.

                        FANDRAL
         And I.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.

                        HOGUN
         And I. The Warriors Three fight
         together.

                        SIF
         I fear we'll live to regret this.

                        VOLSTAGG
         If we're lucky.

         27 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27

         Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
         across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
         ready their battle gear for their journey.
         Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
         Hogun notices.

                        THOR
         We must first find a way to get
         past Heimdall.

                        VOLSTAGG
         That will be no easy task. It's
         said the Gatekeeper can see a
         single dew drop fall from a blade
         of grass a thousand worlds away.

                        FANDRAL
         And he can hear a cricket passing
         gas in Niffelheim.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Jest not! He heareth all!

                        FANDRAL
         Please. Getting past him should be
         simple enough now, since he seems
         to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
         under his nose.
         Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Forgive him! He meaneth no
         offense!
         Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A.

         28 EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28

         Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
         the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
         most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

         THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
         Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
         mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
         ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
         Observatory.

         29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29

         The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
         Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
         them, blocking their way, staring them down.
         There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
         Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
         intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
         glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

                        LOKI
         Keep your weapons sheathed and your
         mouths closed. This is going to
         take subtlety and sincerity, not
         brute strength. Leave it to me.
         Loki dismounts and steps forward.

         LOKI (CONT'D)

                        GOOD HEIMDALL--

                        HEIMDALL
         You're not dressed warmly enough.
         Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.

                        LOKI
         I'm sorry?

                        HEIMDALL
         The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
         will kill you all in time, even
         Thor.

                        (THEN)
         You think you can deceive me? I,
         who watch all? I, who can sense
         the flapping of a butterfly's wings
         a thousand worlds away?
         He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.

         HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
         Or can hear a cricket passing gas
         in Niffelheim?
         Fandral looks gob-smacked.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.

                        FANDRAL
         That was just a bit of a jest,
         really...
         Loki goes into damage control.

                        LOKI
         You must be mistaken. We're not--

                        THOR

                        (STEPPING FORWARD)
         Enough.

                        (TO HEIMDALL)
         Heimdall, may we pass?
         Heimdall stares him down.

                        HEIMDALL
         For ages have I guarded Asgard and
         kept it safe from those who would
         do it harm. In all that time,
         never has an enemy slipped by my
         watch -- until this day. I wish to
         know how that happened.

                        THOR
         Then tell no one where we've gone
         until we've returned.
         Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
         pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
         him.

                        VOLSTAGG
         What happened? Your silver tongue
         turn to lead?

                        LOKI
         Get me off this bridge before it
         cracks under your girth.
         Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.

         30 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30

         Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
         platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
         at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.

                        HEIMDALL
         Be warned. I will honor my sworn
         oath to protect this Realm as its
         Gatekeeper. If your return
         threatens the safety of Asgard,
         Bifrost will remain closed to you.
         You'll be left to die in the cold
         wastes of Jotunheim.

                        THOR
         I have no plans to die today.

                        HEIMDALL
         None do.
         Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
         apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

         31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31

         The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
         the Observatory.

         32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32

         Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
         Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
         section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
         sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
         the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
         The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
         and his five comrades stand.

                        HEIMDALL
         All is ready. You may pass.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Couldn't you just leave the bridge
         open for us?

                        HEIMDALL
         To keep this bridge open would
         unleash the full power of the
         Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
         you upon it.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Ah. Never mind, then.
         Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
         grins.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.

                        THOR
         Come on. Don't be bashful.
         The others join him at his side, then step towards the
         Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
         changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
         elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
         off the platform and inside the vortex.

         33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33

         A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
         out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
         and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
         imprinted on the ice around them.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
         Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
         grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
         precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
         inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

                        THOR
         Come on, big fella. Up...!
         With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
         ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

                        VOLSTAGG
         This belt! This belt is now my
         lucky belt! I will never remove
         it! Even when bathing!

                        FANDRAL
         You bathe?
         Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
         at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
         is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
         apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
         and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
         and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
         city lies in the distance.

                        HOGUN
         We shouldn't be here.

                        THOR
         Too late now.

                        FANDRAL
         Actually, it's not. We could turn
         right around, hop back to Asgard,
         share a mug by the fire. Could be
         nice.
         Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

                        LOKI
         Perhaps we should wait.
         Thor turns back to his brother.

                        THOR
         For what?

                        LOKI
         To survey the enemy. To gauge
         their strengths and weaknesses from
         a distance.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.

                        VOLSTAGG
         I'm liking that. Gauging,
         surveying. Particularly the
         distance part.

                        THOR
         We know all we must. It's time to
         act.
         Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

                        SIF
         He's just got to swing his
         hammer...

         34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34

         The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
         shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
         looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
         Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

                        THOR
         It feels good, doesn't it? To be
         together again, adventuring on
         another world?

                        FANDRAL
         Adventuring? Is that what we're
         doing?

                        THOR
         What would you call it?

                        FANDRAL
         Freezing.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Starving.

                        SIF
         Whining.

                        THOR
         How about a song to lift our
         spirits?
         The others groan.

                        HOGUN
         No, not that!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.

                        SIF
         Please don't make us sing again!

                        FANDRAL
         If I have to listen to Volstagg's
         singing voice one more time, I'll
         fall on my own sword!

                        SIF
         Well, now I'm on board.
         She and Thor share a grin.
         The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
         structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
         warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
         central plaza.

         SIF (CONT'D)
         Where are they?

                        THOR
         Hiding. As cowards always do.
         Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
         Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
         FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

         35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35

         The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
         the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
         The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
         A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

                        JOTUN SENTRY
         What is your business here,
         Asgardian?
         The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.

                        THOR
         I speak only to your King. Not to
         his foot soldiers.

         JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
         Then speak.
         Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
         where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
         waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
         proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
         his people have endured.

                        LAUFEY
         I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

                        THOR
         And I am--

                        LAUFEY
         We know who you are, Odinson. Why
         have you brought the stench of your
         blood into my world?

                        THOR
         I demand answers.
         Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

                        LAUFEY
         You ""demand?""

                        THOR
         How did your people get into
         Asgard?

                        LAUFEY
         The house of Odin is full of
         traitors.
         Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
         by the Jotun King's words.

                        THOR
         Do not dishonor my father's name
         with your lies.

                        LAUFEY
         Your father is a murderer and a
         thief. He stole what was ours, and
         left our world in ruins. We have
         the right to reclaim the Casket.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.

                        THOR
         Not when you'd use it to make war
         against other Realms.
         Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

                        LAUFEY
         And why have you come here? To
         make peace? You long for battle.
         You crave it. I see you for what
         you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
         a boy, trying to prove himself a
         man.

                        THOR
         This boy has grown tired of your
         mockery.
         Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
         front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
         Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
         tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
         him.

                        LOKI
         Thor, stop and think. Look around
         you. We are outnumbered.

                        THOR
         Know your place, brother...

                        LAUFEY
         You should listen to his counsel.
         You know not what your actions
         would unleash.
         Laufey steps out of the shadows.

         LAUFEY (CONT'D)
         But I do. Go now, while I still
         allow it.
         Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

                        LOKI
         We will accept your most gracious
         offer.
         The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
         a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
         breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
         nearby mutters under his breath.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.

                        JOTUN
         Run back home, little princess.
         Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
         coming.

                        LOKI
         Damn.
         In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
         the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
         draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
         Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
         own!
         ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
         around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
         SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

                        FANDRAL
         I'm hoping that's just decorative.
         Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
         Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
         separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
         around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
         this.

                        THOR
         Next!
         Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

                        FANDRAL
         Well? What move, do you think?

                        VOLSTAGG
         I say we use ""The Norn's Revenge.""

                        FANDRAL
         At this close range? I think ""The
         Alfheim Lunge"" is a better move.

                        VOLSTAGG

                        (DISGUSTED)
         Maybe if they were three feet tall!
         No! How about ""The Randy
         Valkyrie""?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.

                        HOGUN
         Shut up!
         Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
         loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
         A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
         hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
         mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
         hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
         him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
         back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
         with his mace.
         Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
         double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

                        SIF
         If you don't treat me like a lady,
         I won't act like a lady!
         She takes out the Jotun.
         Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
         the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
         swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
         The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
         out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
         crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

                        LOKI
         (to the falling Giant)
         Pathetic.
         He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
         either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
         once.
         Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
         The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
         punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
         long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
         front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
         Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

                        THOR
         Come on! At least make it a
         challenge for me!
         He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
         tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
         rises, grins.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Now that's more like it!
         He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
         head over heels.
         Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
         back to his grasp.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         (re: the fallen Brute)
         Ugly and stupid.
         Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
         ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
         Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
         sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
         the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

                        SIF
         (to Hogun, re: knife)
         I'm so glad I taught him how to do
         that!
         Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
         hits in.

                        VOLSTAGG
         You may want to put some ice on
         that!
         The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
         a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
         Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         You may be taller, but I'm wider!
         Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
         flying.
         Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
         sending him crashing to the ground.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         It's not too late for you to
         surrender.
         Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
         bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
         Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
         Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
         Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
         ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
         Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
         to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
         opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
         out a small FLASK.
         Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
         to his comrades.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         Don't let them grab hold of you!
         He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
         battle.
         Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
         stops mid ice layer.
         The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
         and the warrior drops to one knee.
         Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
         quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
         her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
         chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         (on his belly)
         Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
         had him!

                        SIF
         Of course you did.
         Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
         them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
         bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
         the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
         out.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
         A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
         FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
         Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
         goes.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Hang on!
         Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
         Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
         worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
         close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

                        HOGUN
         Watch the legs!

                        VOLSTAGG

                        (REALIZING)
         Right. Sorry.
         Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
         freeing Hogun's feet.
         Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

                        FANDRAL
         You really think your icicles are a
         match for Asgardian steel?
         Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
         away.

         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
         Fair enough.
         Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
         sword and snaps it in half.

         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
         Could we stop just a moment while I
         get another sword?
         Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
         then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
         the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
         through with his own weapon.
         The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
         pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
         forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
         rendering him helpless.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
         Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
         felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
         unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
         them off.
         Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

                        VOLSTAGG
         That's unfortunate.
         He hurries to his wounded comrade.

                        FANDRAL
         I may need a bit of help. Not a
         good look, is it?

                        VOLSTAGG
         Just try not to bleed.

                        FANDRAL
         How's the face?

                        VOLSTAGG
         Flawless.
         Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
         stalagmite.
         Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
         Giants.
         The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
         hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
         grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
         his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
         Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
         of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
         -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
         painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
         The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
         unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
         distraction, KICKS the Giant.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
         Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
         the Jotuns around him.

                        THOR
         Come on!
         But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
         Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
         from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
         Mjolnir falls to the ground.
         A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
         ground, to no avail.
         Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
         slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
         leave.
         From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
         it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
         palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
         wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
         The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
         feet.

                        LOKI
         That can't be good.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Yes, it could! Might be an early
         spring!
         They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
         shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
         awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
         Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.

                        LOKI
         Thor, we must go!
         Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
         mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
         look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
         of battle.

                        THOR
         Then go!

                        SIF
         There are too many of them!

                        THOR
         I can stop them!
         The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
         around them.

                        SIF
         Thor!
         But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Run!
         Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
         the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
         chase.
         Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
         The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
         disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

                        MOMENT --

         THOR'S FIST
         Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
         He opens his hand, beckoning.
         One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
         him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
         the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
         raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
         with all his might.
         KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
         channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
         Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
         shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
         But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
         shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
         where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
         beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         What's Thor done?

                        LOKI
         Likely killed us all!
         As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
         mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
         quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
         The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
         a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
         move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
         Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
         raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
         the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
         comrades.

         35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

         Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

                        THOR
         Loki, we have to see.
         Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
         But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
         the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
         many, even for a Thunder God.

                        VOLSTAGG

                        (TO LOKI)
         Actually, could you bring the mists
         back, please?
         Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
         The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
         ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
         down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
         comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
         all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

                        ODIN ALLFATHER
         Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
         in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
         The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
         stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
         Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
         his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
         react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
         to-face with Odin.
         Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
         about to happen.
         Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
         Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
         not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
         earshot of the others.

                        ODIN
         Laufey. End this.

                        LAUFEY
         Your boy sought this out.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.

                        ODIN
         You're right. These are the
         actions of a boy. Treat them as
         such. You and I can stop this
         before there's further bloodshed.
         Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
         blade at the end of his arm.

                        LAUFEY
         We are beyond diplomacy now,
         Allfather. He'll get what he came
         for -- war and death.
         Odin looks grim, determined.

                        ODIN
         So be it.
         Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
         Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
         the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
         in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
         The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
         fleeing Jotuns with delight.

                        THOR
         Now! We'll finish them together!

                        ODIN
         Silence!
         Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
         Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
         the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
         hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
         Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

         36 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

         Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
         Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
         Heimdall backs away.

                        THOR
         Why did you bring us back?

                        ODIN
         Do you realize what you've done?
         What you've started?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A.

                        THOR
         I was protecting my home.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.

                        ODIN
         You cannot protect your friends.
         How can you hope to protect a
         kingdom?
         Odin turns to the others.

         ODIN (CONT'D)

                        (RE: FANDRAL)
         Get him to the healing room!
         Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
         room.

                        THOR
         There won't be a kingdom to protect
         if you're afraid to act!
         Odin stares at him.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Whatever the cost, the world must
         know that the new King of Asgard
         will not be held in contempt.

                        ODIN
         That's pride and vanity that talks!
         Not leadership! Have you forgotten
         everything I've taught you? What
         of a warrior's patience, cunning?

                        THOR
         While you wait and be patient, the
         Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
         ways are done. You'd stand giving
         speeches while Asgard falls!

                        ODIN
         You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

                        THOR
         And you are an old man and a fool!
         The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
         quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
         beneath the calmness of his words.

                        ODIN
         A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
         you were ready.
         Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34A.

                        LOKI

                        FATHER--
         Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
         tracks.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.

                        ODIN
         Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
         the express command of your King.
         Through your arrogance and
         stupidity, you have opened these
         peaceful Realms and innocent lives
         to the horrors of war.
         The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
         panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
         with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
         of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
         Odin turns angrily to his son.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         You are unworthy of this Realm...
         Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         ...unworthy of your title...
         He rips away Thor's cloak.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         ...unworthy of the loved ones
         you've betrayed. I hereby take
         from you your powers.
         Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
         from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         In the name of my father...
         A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
         disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
         chest piece.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         ...and of his father before...
         Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
         including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         I cast you out!
         Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
         THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
         disappears in the vortex.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
         Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
         closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
         quietly.

         ODIN (CONT'D)

                        (WHISPERING)
         Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
         be worthy, shall possess the power
         of Thor.
         RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
         smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
         disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
         the Bifrost.

         CUT TO BLACK.

         37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

         Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
         blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
         swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
         into him, as we:

         CUT TO BLACK.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36.
         After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

         DARCY (V.O.)
         I think that was legally your
         fault.

         JANE (V.O.)
         Get the first aid kit.

                        (THEN)
         Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
         and don't be dead, okay? Open your
         eyes and look at me.

         THOR'S POV
         Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
         concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

         DARCY (O.S.)
         Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
         know CPR.

         END THOR'S POV

         TIME CUT TO:
         Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
         heads. A thought strikes her.

                        JANE

                        (TO SELVIG)
         Where did he come from?
         They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
         up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
         Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
         Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
         her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
         Thor searches the ground.

                        THOR
         Hammer...

                        DARCY
         Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
         That's pretty obvious.
         Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
         her flashlight down at the sand.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A.

                        JANE
         Erik... look at this.
         He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
         pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
         Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
         snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
         away.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         We've got to move fast before
         anything changes.

                        (MORE)







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         We need soil samples, light
         readings, everything.
         She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
         readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
         Thor, who stares up at the sky.

                        SELVIG
         Jane, we need get him to a
         hospital.
         Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
         cannister.

                        JANE
         Not right now. It'll take too
         long. County's an hour away.
         We'll drop him off after we're done
         here.
         Selvig looks uncertain.

         JANE (CONT'D)

                        (RE: THOR)
         Look at him, he's fine.
         Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.

                        THOR
         Father! Heimdall! I know you can
         hear me! Open the bridge!

                        JANE
         (off Selvig's look)
         Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
         hospital, I'll stay here.

                        SELVIG
         You expect me to leave you alone in
         the middle of the desert?
         Thor turns to the others, frustrated.

                        THOR
         You! What world is this?
         The group is intimidated by his fervor.

                        SELVIG
         It's all right, my friend. We're
         going to get you some help.
         Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
         agitated, belligerent.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.

                        THOR
         Where am I?! Answer me!
         Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
         Jane looks on, concerned.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.

                        JANE
         Erik, just back away...

                        SELVIG
         (to Thor, calming)
         You're in the desert outside the
         town of Puente Antiguo.

                        THOR
         What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

                        DARCY
         Uh... New Mexico?
         Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
         unsure what to make of it.

                        THOR
         You dare threaten Thor with so puny

                        A--
         Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
         ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
         ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.

                        DARCY
         What? He was freaking me out.

         38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

         As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
         to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

                        SELVIG

                        (TO DARCY)
         Next time you decide to taser
         someone, do me a favor and make
         sure they're already inside the
         truck.

                        (TO JANE)
         Jane, come on...
         Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.

         39 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

         The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
         overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
         energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
         into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
         meteor.

                        40 OMITTED 40







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39.

         41 EXT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 41

         The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.

         42 INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 42

         Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
         ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
         stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE
         Name?

                        JANE
         He said it was ""Thor.""
         The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
         at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE

                        (SPELLING)
         T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
         him?

                        JANE
         I've never met him before.

                        DARCY
         Until she hit him with the car.

                        JANE
         Grazed him, actually.

                        (THEN)
         Oh, and we tasered him, too.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE

                        (SYMPATHETIC)
         Must have been quite the spat.

                        JANE
         I told you, I don't know him. I
         just want to make sure he's okay.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE
         I'm going to need a name and
         contact number.

                        JANE
         Jane Foster.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE

                        (TYPING SLOWLY)

         J...A...N...







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39A.

                        SELVIG
         Oh, for God's sake...
         He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
         business card.

         SELVIG (CONT'D)
         Here. Let's go.
         Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40.

         43 INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

         Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
         a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
         arm.

                        NURSE
         Hi. Just taking a little blood.
         Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.

                        THOR
         How dare you attack the son of
         Odin!

                        NURSE
         I need some help!
         Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.

         NURSE (CONT'D)
         We're trying to help you!

                        THOR
         Then bring me a healing stone, you
         savages!
         He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
         couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
         struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
         furniture overturned.

                        ORDERLY
         What the hell is this guy on?
         Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
         looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
         by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.

                        THOR
         You're no match for the Mighty--
         Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.

         44 EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44

         Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
         his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
         peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

                        TOWNIE
         Huh.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
         The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
         We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
         otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
         tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
         strains with all his might, with no luck.
         He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
         object.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.

          TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          Huh.

         45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

         The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
         Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
         desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
         her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
         A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
         Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
         Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
         He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
         entitled ""J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS"". He looks proud.
         The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
         and excitement.

                        JANE
         Darcy, when you're done, take the
         soil samples to Professor Meyers in
         geology. Remind him, he owes me.

                        SELVIG
         We might want to perform a spectral
         analysis.

                        JANE
         ""We?""

                        SELVIG
         I flew all the way out here --
         might as well make myself useful.
         This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
         inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
         rack-mounted server.

                        JANE
         You know what would be really
         useful? Do you still have that
         friend at LIGO?

                        SELVIG
         She was more than a friend.

                        JANE
         Could you call in a favor?

                        SELVIG
         You don't think this was just a
         magnetic storm?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.

                        JANE
         If I'm right, their observatory
         must have picked up gravitational
         waves during last night's event.

                        SELVIG
         Meaning?
         Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

                        JANE
         Meaning these anomalies might
         signify something bigger.

                        SELVIG
         How ""big"" are we talking about?
         Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
         the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
         appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
         covered with stars.

                        JANE
         I think the lensing around the
         edges is characteristic of an
         Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

                        DARCY
         A what?

                        SELVIG
         I thought you were a science major.

                        DARCY
         Political Science.
         Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

                        JANE
         She was the only applicant.

                        SELVIG

                        (TO DARCY)
         An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
         ""theoretical"" connection between
         two different points of space-time.
         Darcy stares blankly.

                        JANE

                        (TO DARCY)
         A wormhole.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
         Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
         monitor.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Erik, look...







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
         Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
         through the ""bubble"" in the clouds.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         What do you see here?

                        SELVIG
         Stars.

                        JANE
         Yes. But not our stars.
         She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
         excitement.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         This is the star alignment for our
         quadrant, this time of year. So
         unless Ursa Minor decided to take
         the day off... those are someone
         else's constellations.
         Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
         Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
         the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
         image catches her eye.

                        DARCY
         Hey, check it out.
         Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

                        SELVIG
         Is that...?

                        JANE
         I think I left something at the
         hospital.
         As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
         funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
         of a MAN.

         45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A

         At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
         balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
         looking out over Asgard.

         46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46

         Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.

                        FRIGGA
         How could you have done this?

                        ODIN
         Do you understand what he set in
         motion? He's taken us to the brink
         of war!

                        FRIGGA
         But banishment? You would lose him
         forever? He's your son!

                        ODIN
         What would you have done?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.

                        FRIGGA
         I would not have exiled him to a
         world of mortals, stripped of his
         powers, to suffer alone. I would
         not have had the heart for such
         cruelty!

                        ODIN
         That is why I'm King.

                        (THEN)
         I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
         But there are some things that even
         I cannot undo.

                        FRIGGA
         You can bring him back.

                        ODIN
         No. His fate is in his own hands
         now.

         47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47

         Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
         wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
         avail.

                        THOR
         It's not possible.
         He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
         slips free from its restraint.

         47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A

         Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
         nearby.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE
         I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
         patients.

                        JANE

                        (THINKING FAST)
         But... I'm his wife.
         Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE
         I thought you said you didn't know
         him.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.

                        JANE
         I meant I barely know him anymore.
         The man he's become. He's changed.
         I mean, what woman really knows her
         husband, anyway?

                        ADMISSIONS NURSE
         None of us, dear. He's in Room

         102.

         48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48

         Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
         destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44.
         They enter Thor's room.

         49 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 49

         They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.

         50 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 50

         Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.

         51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51

         Jane starts the car, frustrated.

                        JANE
         Typical. I just lost my most
         important piece of evidence.

                        DARCY
         So now what?

                        JANE
         We find him.

                        SELVIG
         Did you see what he did in there?
         I don't know if finding him is the
         best idea.

                        JANE
         I want to know what that thing was,
         and he may have the answers. We
         don't have a choice.

                        DARCY
         Oo-kay.
         She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

                        SELVIG
         So we're just going to spend the
         rest of the day looking for him?

                        JANE
         However long it takes.
         Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --

         BAM!
         She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
         scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A.

         52 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 52

         Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

                        JANE
         I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
         doing that on purpose.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45.
         Thor looks up at the sky.

                        THOR
         Blue sky... one sun... This is
         Earth, isn't it?

                        DARCY
         I think you may have hit him with
         the car one time too many.

                        JANE

                        (TO THOR)
         Let's get you some clothes.

         53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53

         Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
         shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
         ROARING central fire.
         Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
         STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
         carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
         the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
         comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
         Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
         Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
         blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
         Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
         Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
         its normal color.

                        VOLSTAGG
         We should never have let him go.

                        SIF
         There was no stopping him.

                        FANDRAL
         At least he's only banished, not
         dead. Which is what we'd all be if
         that guard hadn't told Odin where
         we'd gone.

                        VOLSTAGG
         How did the guard even know?
         Loki stares at his arm.

                        LOKI
         I told him.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.

                         FANDRAL
         What?

                        LOKI
         I told him to go to Odin after we'd
         left. Though he should be flogged
         for taking so long.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.

                        VOLSTAGG
         You told the guard?

                        LOKI
         I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
         had no idea Father would banish him
         for what he did.

                        SIF
         Loki, you're the only one who can
         help Thor now. You must go to the
         Allfather and convince him to
         change his mind!

                        LOKI
         And if I do, then what? I love
         Thor more dearly than any of you,
         but you know what he is. He's
         arrogant. He's reckless. He's
         dangerous. You saw how he was
         today. Is that what Asgard needs
         from its King?
         The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
         leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

                        SIF
         He may speak about the good of
         Asgard, but he's always been
         jealous of Thor.

                        VOLSTAGG
         True, but we should be grateful to
         him. He did save our lives.

                        HOGUN
         Laufey said there were traitors in
         the House of Odin.
         The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

                        FANDRAL
         Why is it every time you choose to
         speak, it has to be something dark
         and ominous?

                        HOGUN
         A master of magic could easily
         bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
         The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.

                        VOLSTAGG
         No! Surely not!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.

                        FANDRAL
         Loki's always been one for
         mischief, but you're talking about
         something else entirely.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.

                        SIF
         Who else could elude Heimdall's
         gaze with tricks of light and
         shadow?

                        VOLSTAGG
         The ceremony was interrupted just
         before Thor was named King.

                        SIF
         We should go to the Allfather.

                        FANDRAL
         And tell him what? ""Oh, by the
         way, we think your son just
         betrayed the throne. And do us a
         favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
         good fellow!""

                        SIF
         It's our duty. If any of our
         suspicions are right, then all of
         Asgard is in danger.

         54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54

         Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
         sitting on its stand.
         He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
         between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
         blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
         The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
         Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
         metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
         the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.

          ODIN (O.S.)
         Stop!
         Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
         goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
         Odin eyes Loki with dismay.

                        LOKI
         Am I cursed?

                        ODIN
         No. Put the Casket down.
         Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
         returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
         father.

                        LOKI
         What am I?

                        ODIN
         You're my son.

                        LOKI
         What more than that?
         Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
         Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         The Casket wasn't the only thing
         you took from Jotunheim that day,
         was it?
         Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

                        ODIN
         No.

                        (BEAT)
         In the aftermath of the battle, I
         went into the Temple, and I found a
         baby. Small for a giant's
         offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
         left to die. Laufey's son.
         Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.

                        LOKI
         Laufey's son...
         He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
         blood. Why would you take me?

                        ODIN
         You were an innocent child.

                        LOKI
         You took me for a purpose, what was
         it?
         Odin doesn't answer.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Tell me!

                        ODIN
         I thought we could unite our
         kingdoms one day, bring about an
         alliance, bring about a permanent
         peace... through you. But those
         plans no longer matter.

                        LOKI
         So I am no more than another stolen
         relic, locked up here until you
         might have use of me.

                        ODIN
         Why do you twist my words?

                        LOKI
         You could have told me what I was
         from the beginning. Why didn't
         you?

                        ODIN
         You are my son. My blood. I
         wanted only to protect you from the
         truth.

                        LOKI
         Because I am the monster parents
         tell their children about at night?

                        ODIN
         Don't...

                        LOKI
         It all makes sense now. Why you
         favored Thor all these years.

                        ODIN
         Listen...







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B.

                        LOKI
         Because no matter how much you
         claim to ""love"" me, you could never
         have a Frost Giant sitting on the
         Throne of Asgard!
         Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
         move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
         the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
         to fight it off.

                        ODIN
         Listen to me!
         Loki strides away towards the exit.

         ODIN (CONT'D)
         Loki!
         Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
         and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
         The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
         now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
         trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
         Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
         scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
         Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
         calls out.

                        LOKI
         Guards!

         58 EXT. OUTSIDE OF CRATER - DAY 58

         Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the
         sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51.

         59 EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59

         It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
         lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
         watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
         line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
         One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
         the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
         effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
         cell phones.
         They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
         PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
         TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
         from the back of the truck.
         He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
         the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

                        EAGER TOWNIE
         This'll do it.
         He yells to the driver.

         EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
         Okay, let 'er rip!
         The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
         STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
         of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
         and go flying.
         People dive out of the way.
         The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN ""THE MAN""
         LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
         continuing. They don't notice as --

         ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
         An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
         a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
         below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
         crater.
         He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
         which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
         pulls out a phone.

                        COULSON

                        (INTO PHONE)
         Sir -- we've found it.

         60 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60

         In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
         around for a t-shirt.
         Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
         his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
         rippling biceps.

                        DARCY
         You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
         he's pretty cut.
         Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
         t-shirt.

         DARCY (CONT'D)
         Hey, sorry I tased you!
         Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
         equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
         stop to it.

                        JANE
         Excuse me... excuse me!
         She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
         t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
         ""HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE"". Thor looks at it,
         puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52.

          JANE (CONT'D)
         My ex.
         Thor stares at her a beat.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         They're the only clothes I had
         that'll fit you. Sorry.

                        THOR
         They will suffice.
         Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
         the wall.

                        JANE
         You're welcome. Now tell me...
         Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
         his form in the Bifrost photo.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         What were you doing, in that?
         He glances at it, dismissive.

                        THOR
         What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
         Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
         Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
         moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
         the book, curious.

                        SELVIG
         (amused, skeptical)
         The Bifrost...
         Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
         to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
         book.

                        JANE
         What exactly is the Bifrost?

                        THOR

                        (IGNORING HER)
         This mortal form has grown weak.

                        JANE

                        BUT--







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52A.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

         61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61

         Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
         lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
         space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
         walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
         him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
         Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
         softly to him.

                        FRIGGA
         I asked him to be honest with you
         from the beginning. There should
         be no secrets in a family.

                        LOKI
         So why did he lie?

                        FRIGGA
         He kept the truth from you so that
         you would never feel different.
         You are in every way our son, Loki,
         and we your family. You must know
         that.
         Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)

                        (RE: ODIN)
         You can speak to him. He can see
         and hear us, even now.

                        LOKI
         How long will it last?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.

                        FRIGGA
         I don't know. This time is
         different. We were unprepared.

                        LOKI
         I never get used to seeing him like
         this. The most powerful being in
         the Nine Realms lying helpless
         until his body is restored.

                        FRIGGA
         But he's put it off for so long
         now, I fear...
         Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
         eyes.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         You're a good son.
         Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
         really feels.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         We mustn't lose hope that your
         father will return to us. And your
         brother.
         Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

                        LOKI
         What hope is there for Thor?

                        FRIGGA
         There's always a purpose to
         everything your father does. Thor
         may yet find a way home.
         Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
         the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
         hurriedly approaching.

         THE EINHERJAR GUARD
         Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
         the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
         baffled.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         Thor is banished. The line of
         succession falls to you. Until he
         awakens, Asgard is yours.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
         The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
         EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
         before Loki, offers the spear to him.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         Make your father proud.
         Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
         feel of it in his hand.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54.

         62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62

         Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
         diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
         huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
         pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
         Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

                        JANE
         Now tell us exactly what happened
         to you last night.
         Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
         flustered, looks away.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Maybe start with how you got inside
         that cloud.

                        DARCY
         And how you could eat an entire box
         of Pop-Tarts and still be this
         hungry.
         Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
         coffee.

                        THOR
         (re: coffee mug)
         This drink. I like it.

                        DARCY
         (to Thor, re: coffee)
         Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
         Isabela makes the best coffee in
         town.
         Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

                        THOR

                        (CALLS OUT)
         Another!
         ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
         from behind the counter.

                        JANE
         Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

                        (IN SPANISH)
         Yo voy a pagar la taza.
         Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
         Spanish.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54A.

                        ISABELA

                        (IN SPANISH)
         Did you see that? The first time
         she brings a man in here, and he's
         a lunatic!

                        JANE
         (to Thor, re: mug)
         What was that?
         He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

                        THOR
         It was delicious. I want another.

                        JANE
         Then you should just say so!

                        THOR
         I just did.

                        JANE
         I mean ask for it. Nicely.

                        THOR
         I meant no disrespect.

                        JANE
         All right, then no more smashing,
         deal?

                        THOR
         You have my word.

                        JANE
         Good.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
         A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
         the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
         is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

                        ISABELA
         Morning, Pete. Jake.

                        TOWNIE PETE
         The usual, please, Izzy.
         Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.

         DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
         You missed all the excitement out
         at the crater.

                        ISABELA
         What crater?
         Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
         Townies with interest.

                        TOWNIE PETE
         They're saying some kind of
         satellite crashed in the desert.

         DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
         We were having a good time with it
         till the Feds showed up, chased us
         out.

                        JANE
         (to the Townies)
         Excuse me, did you say there was a
         satellite crash?

         DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
         Yep. They said it was radioactive.
         And I had my hands all over it.

                        (REALIZING)
         I'm probably sterile now.
         Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
         pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.

                        DARCY
         Oh my God, this is going on
         Facebook.
         Darcy whips out her cellphone.

         DARCY (CONT'D)

                        (TO THOR)
         Smile!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
         Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
         massive stack of food.

                        SELVIG
         (to the Townies)
         What did the satellite look like?

         DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
         I don't know nothing about
         satellites. But it was heavy.
         Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
         This gets Thor's attention.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.
         Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
         and pulls the Townie around to face him.

                        THOR
         Where?!

         DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
         About twelve miles east of here.
         Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
         the diner.

                        PETE
         I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
         whole Army was coming in when we
         left!

         63 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63

         Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
         Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

                        JANE
         Where are you going?

                        THOR
         Twelve miles east of here.
         He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
         with him.

                        JANE
         Why?

                        THOR
         To get what belongs to me.

                        JANE
         So now you own a satellite?

                        THOR
         It's not what they say it is.

                        JANE
         Whatever it is, the government
         seems to think it's theirs. You
         intend to just walk in there and
         take it?

                        THOR
         Yes.
         He stops walking.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         If you take me there now, I'll tell
         you everything you wish to know.

                        JANE
         Everything?

                        THOR
         All the answers you seek will be
         yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
         Darcy looks to the others.

                        DARCY
         ""Myeu-muh?"" What's ""Myeu-muh?""
         Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,

                        WHEN:

                        SELVIG
         Jane.
         He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
         care for him.

         SELVIG (CONT'D)

                        (TO JANE)
         Please don't do this.

                        JANE
         You know what we saw last night.
         This can't be a coincidence. I
         want to know what's in that crater.

                        SELVIG
         I'm not talking about the crater.
         I'm talking about him.

                        JANE
         He's promised us answers.

                        SELVIG
         He's delusional! Listen to what
         he's saying! ""Thor."" ""Bifrost.""
         ""Mjolnir."" These are the stories I
         grew up with as a child!

                        JANE
         I'd just be driving him out there,
         that's all.

                        SELVIG
         It's dangerous. He's dangerous.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
         After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
         Darcy.

                        JANE
         I'm sorry. I can't take you.

                        THOR
         I understand. Then this is where
         we say goodbye.
         He takes her hand and kisses it.

                        JANE
         That's... thank you.
         Thor bows slightly to each of them.

                        THOR
         Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
         Darcy. Farewell.
         He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

                        SELVIG
         Now... let's get back to the lab.
         We have work to do.
         Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
         as he walks away down the street.

         64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64

         Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
         Room.

         65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65

         Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
         Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.

                        SIF
         Allfather, we must speak with you

                        URGENTLY--
         But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --

                        LOKI
         Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
         horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
         Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.

                        VOLSTAGG
         What is this?

                        LOKI
         My friends... you haven't heard? I
         am now Ruler of Asgard.

                        FANDRAL
         Where is Odin?

                        LOKI
         Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
         My mother fears he may never awaken
         again.

                        SIF
         We would speak with her.
         Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.

                        LOKI
         She has refused to leave my
         father's bedside. You can bring
         your ""urgent"" matter to me, your
         King.
         Sif covers quickly.

                        SIF
         We would ask you to end Thor's
         banishment.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.

                        LOKI
         My first command can not be to undo
         the Allfather's last. We're on the
         brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
         people must have a sense of
         continuity in order to feel safe in
         these difficult times.
         Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
         this.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         All of us must stand together, for
         the good of Asgard.

                        FANDRAL
         Of course.
         Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
         stares after them.

         66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66

         Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
         Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
         by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
         partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
         from her lab.

                        JANE
         Hey! That's my stuff!

         66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

         Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
         vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
         lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
         the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
         Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
         scientific instruments and documents.

                        JANE
         What the hell is going on here?!
         The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.

                        COULSON
         Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

         SHIELD.
         Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.

                        JANE
         I don't care who you work for, you
         can't do this!

                        SELVIG
         Jane. This is more serious than
         you realize. Let it go.

                        JANE
         Let it go?! This is my life!

                        COULSON
         We're here investigating a security
         threat. We need to appropriate
         your equipment and all your
         atmospheric data.

                        JANE
         By ""appropriate"" you mean ""steal?""
         Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.

                        COULSON
         This should more than compensate
         you for your trouble.
         She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.

                        JANE
         I can't just pick up replacements
         from RadioShack! I made most of
         that equipment myself!

                        COULSON
         Then I'm sure you can do it again.

                        JANE
         And I'm sure I can sue you for
         violating my constitutional rights!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.

                        COULSON
         We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
         He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
         fully herself, fueled by outrage.

                        JANE
         So are we! We're on the verge of

                        UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
         extraordinary.
         Jane holds up her notebook.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Everything I know about this
         phenomenon is in this lab and in
         this book, and no one has the right
         to take it from me.
         Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
         notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
         carrying. Jane is stunned.

                        COULSON
         Thank you for your cooperation.
         He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.

         67 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 67

         Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
         empty space.

                        JANE
         Years of research, gone.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.

                        DARCY
         They even took my iPod.

                        SELVIG
         And your back-ups?

                        JANE
         Look around! They took our back-
         ups. They took the back-ups of our
         back-ups.

                        DARCY
         I just downloaded, like, thirty
         songs on there.

                        JANE

                        (TO DARCY)
         Will you please stop talking about
         your iPod?!

                        (TO SELVIG)
         Who are these people?

                        SELVIG
         No one knows much about them. But
         I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
         gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
         and he was never heard from again.

                        JANE
         I'm not going to let them do this.
         I'm getting everything back.

                        SELVIG
         Please, let me contact one of my
         colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
         dealings with these people. I'll e-
         mail him and see if he can help.

                        DARCY
         They took your laptop, too.
         Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

         67A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 67A

         Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
         town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, ""FREE

         INTERNET.""

                        SELVIG
         I'll just be a minute.
         He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
         and sees something that intrigues her.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A.

         68 INT. PET STORE - DAY 68

         Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

                        THOR
         I need a horse.

         PET STORE CLERK
         Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
         dogs, cats, birds.

                        THOR
         Then give me one of those, large
         enough to ride.
         The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
         Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
         Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.

                        JANE
         You still want a lift?

         68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A

         It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
         ""THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS"" -- to a group of kids.

                        LIBRARIAN

                        (READING)
         ""And though they're large, giants
         can be quiet. You have to listen
         carefully for the sound of their
         footsteps -- because they may be
         closer than you think.""
         Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
         e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
         interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
         pleasantly.

         LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
         Joshua, come sit down. It's story
         time.
         The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
         over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

         ""MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.""
         He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
         Scandinavian Mythology.
         It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
         earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
         THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
         of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
         He eyes the illustration, pondering.

                        69 OMITTED 69

         70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70

         Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
         terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.

         71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71

         Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
         Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.

                        JANE
         I've never done anything like this
         before! Have you ever done
         anything like this before?
         Thor looks amused by her excitement.

                        THOR
         Many times. You're brave to do it.

                        JANE
         They just stole my entire life's
         work. I really don't have anything
         left to lose.

                        THOR
         But you're clever. Far more clever
         than anyone else in this Realm.

                        JANE
         ""This Realm?"" Why do you talk like
         that?

                        THOR
         You think me strange?
         Jane laughs, catches herself.

                        JANE
         Yeah. Just a little.

                        THOR
         Good strange or bad strange?

                        JANE
         I'm not quite sure yet.
         She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
         gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
         turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Sorry.
         She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Who are you? Really?

                        THOR
         You'll see soon enough.

                        JANE
         You promised me answers.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
         Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

                        THOR
         What you seek -- it's a bridge.

                        JANE
         A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
         Bridge?

                        THOR
         More like a rainbow bridge.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64.
         A beat.

                         JANE
         God, I hope you're not crazy.

         71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A

         As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
         revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
         closer, we see the glow comes from --

         A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
         Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
         barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
         that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
         complex.
         Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
         translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
         crater.
         Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
         Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
         Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
         work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
         center of it all -- Mjolnir.

         72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

         Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
         binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

                        JANE
         That isn't a satellite crash. They
         would have hauled the wreckage
         away, not built a city around it.
         Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.

                        THOR
         You're going to need this.

                        JANE
         Why?--
         Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
         takes his jacket.

                        THOR
         Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
         will return what they stole from
         you.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
         He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
         request.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Deal?

                        JANE
         No! Look what's down there! You
         can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
         and walk out!

                        THOR
         No.
         Jane looks relieved.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         I'm going to fly out.
         Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
         The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.

                        JANE
         Wait...
         But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

         72A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE 72A

         A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
         holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
         off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
         above.

                        CUT TO:

         73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
         It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:

         74 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM 74

         A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
         security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
         junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.

                        TECHIE
         Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
         penetrate the cloud cover.
         The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
         static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
         terrain map.

         TECHIE (CONT'D)
         Tech's barely working as it is,
         with all the interference that
         thing's giving off.
         He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.

         TECHIE (CONT'D)
         Hey, we've got a commercial
         aircraft coming in right over us,
         Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

                        SITWELL
         Reroute it, like all the others.

                        TECHIE
         Right. Can I get the passengers
         some free drinks for the trouble?
         Sitwell glares at him.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A.

         TECHIE (CONT'D)

                        (SHRUGS)
         It'd be a nice gesture.
         The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
         on another screen, holds up a hand.

         TECHIE (CONT'D)
         Hold a sec... we got something
         outside the fence, west side...
         He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
         THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.

                        SITWELL
         (into a radio)
         DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.

         74A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 74A

         A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
         jeep to investigate.

         74B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B

         Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
         attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
         coming from the hammer containment area.

         75 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 75

         The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
         flashlight, see nothing unusual.

                        AGENT JACKSON

                        (INTO RADIO)
         Looks like we're good here. Must
         have been another coyote.
         Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
         bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
         Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
         illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
         large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
         the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

                        AGENT DELANCEY
         Jackson?
         The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
         across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
         slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
         shotgun at Thor.
         Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
         thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
         Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

         75A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 75A

         Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.

                        SITWELL

                        (INTO RADIO)
         DeLancey, Jackson -- report.

         76 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - MOMENTS LATER 76

         Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
         the base.
         Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
         unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
         radio.

                        SHIELD AGENT
         Agents down! We've got a perimeter
         breach!

         77 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 77

         The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
         Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
         the Techie watch the monitors warily.
         On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
         starts to crackle with energy.

                        SITWELL
         (to the Techie)
         Get Coulson.
         Sitwell punches an alarm.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A.

         78 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 78

         As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
         SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.

         78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A

         A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
         ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
         She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
         recorded message.

         SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
         You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
         Please leave me a message.
         His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.

                        JANE
         Erik, okay, first of all, don't
         worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
         More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         But if you don't hear from me
         again, you might want to come out
         to the crater site and look for me.
         I kind of did what you said I
         shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
         She hangs up.

         79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79

         Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
         across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
         lit up site uneasily.

         80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

         A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
         the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
         As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
         rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
         ground.
         Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
         fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
         more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
         cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
         Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
         entrance tube to the center of the site.
         A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
         see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
         right on him.
         Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
         raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
         He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
         catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
         hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
         the ATV's spotlight.
         Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
         the wheel to protect himself.
         The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
         entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
         Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
         the site entrance.

         80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A

         The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
         the crater lip.
         The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
         straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
         inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
         tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
         The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
         it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

         81 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 81

          Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
          aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
          Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

         Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain
         begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
         He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.

         82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C

         As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
         races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
         inside.

         82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D

         Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
         round the corner.
         Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
         hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
         ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
         backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
         Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
         Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
         the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
         tunnels to find a way towards it.

         82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E

         Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the
         Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
         Coulson activates his radio.

         Through the translucent plastic, we see Thor racing through
         the tubing.

         82G INT. TUNNEL 82G

         As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
         on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
         the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
         Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
         into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
         Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
         give chase.

         82H EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 82H

          Jane looks down at the crater through binoculars, frustrated
          that she can't clearly see what's happening.

         One shot, one kill, sir. Just give
         the word.

         BARTON'S NIGHTVISION POV
         Overlooking the complex. It's a clear field of vision,
         nowhere to hide. A digital read-out gives information on the
         distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside
         the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and
         heading towards the cube structure.

         BARTON (CONT'D)
         Hello, handsome.

         83A INT. TUNNEL 83A

         Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
         Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
         whatever it takes to keep moving.
         As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
         box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
         He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
         middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
         fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
         reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --

         A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
         The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
         in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

                        THOR
          You're big.
         Thor grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Fought bigger.

         83B EXT. JUNCTION BOX 83B

         Thor and the Huge Agent explode through the wall of the
         junction box, then crash into the mud, sending them sliding.

         Barton has Thor in his sites. The sniper stands still as a
         statue.

         83D INT. TUNNEL 83D

         Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to
         Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an
         electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
         directly above the crater... and the hammer.

         83E EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 83E

         Jane sees SHIELD Agents and Guards swarming into the cube
         containment structure.

                        JANE
         No...

         84 EXT. CRATER 84

         Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
         Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
         sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
         his view.
         Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
         whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
         the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
         Thor's momentum carries him past.
         Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
         Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
         at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
         the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
         defeated.
         Thor races back towards the structure.

         84H INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84H

         From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the
         structure.
         He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
         His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
         around it.
         Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
         one story up.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.
         As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
         brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
         crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
         his interest piqued.
         Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
         bucket comes into view.

         84I EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84I

         Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle
         site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the
         trigger.

         84J INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84J

         Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
         out to it confidently.
         Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
         him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then
         radios Barton.

         squeeze the trigger.

         COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)
         ...hold your fire.
         Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.

         84L INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84L

         Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
         around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
         hammer doesn't move.
         Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
         -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
         his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
         and lightning above him.
         Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
         RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
         But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
         knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
         runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
         Coulson looks on, disappointed.
         SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
         Coulson activates his radio.

                        COULSON
         Ground units, move in. Show's
         over.
         As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
         care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
         rain -- a man broken, lost.
         From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
         room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
         to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
         damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

         Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears
         the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the
         glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
         With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.

         It's not easy to do what you did.
         You made us all look like a bunch
         of mall cops. That's hurtful.

                        (THEN)
         The men you so easily subdued are
         highly-trained professionals, and
         in my experience, it takes someone
         who's received similar training to
         do what you did to them. Would you
         like to tell me where you received
         your training?
         Thor sits silently.

         COULSON (CONT'D)
         Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
         Then again, you strike me more as
         the soldier of fortune type. What
         was it, South Africa?
         Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.

         COULSON (CONT'D)
         Certain groups pay well for a good
         mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
         Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.

         What?

                        LOKI
         Your banishment, the threat of a
         new war, it was too much for him to
         bear.
         The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
         responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
         looks in his eyes, consolingly.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         You mustn't blame yourself. I know
         that you loved him. I tried to
         tell him so, but he wouldn't
         listen.

          LOKI (CONT'D)

                        (THEN)
         It was cruel to put the hammer
         within your reach, knowing you
         could never lift it.
         Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         The burden of the throne has fallen
         to me now.

                        THOR
         Can I come home?

                        LOKI
         The truce with Jotunheim is
         conditional upon your exile.

                        THOR
         But couldn't we find a way to--

                        LOKI
         Mother has forbidden your return.
         Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
         sorry.

                        THOR
         No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
         for coming here.

                        LOKI
         Nothing could have stopped me.
         Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Fare well, brother.

                        THOR
         Good-bye.

                        COULSON
         Good-bye? I just got back.
         Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.

         COULSON (CONT'D)
         Now. Where did we leave off?







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73A.

         90 EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 90

         Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
         Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
         the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
         do it?
         He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
         go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
         He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
         from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.

         91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91

         Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.

                        SITWELL

                        (RE: THOR)
         Sir... he's got a visitor.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74.

         92 INT. SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 92

         Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from
         Erik Selvig.

                        COULSON
         ""Donald Blake?""

                        SELVIG
         Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
         our team.

                        COULSON
         You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
         Selvig.

                        SELVIG
         Troubled, not dangerous. He was
         distraught when he found out that
         you'd taken all of our research.
         It was years of his life, gone! He
         got depressed, started drinking,
         and... well, you know the rest.

                        COULSON
         Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
         moment to verify his identity?

                        SELVIG
         Certainly.
         The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

         SELVIG (CONT'D)
         You can understand how a man could
         go off like that. I mean, a big,
         faceless organization like yours,
         coming in with their jack-booted
         thugs and stealing private
         property...

                        (THEN)
         ...is how he described it.

                        COULSON
         That doesn't explain how he managed
         to tear through our security.
         Selvig shrugs.

                        SELVIG
         Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
         nut.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
         On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
         York pops up reading ""DR. DONALD BLAKE"". The license photo
         is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
         cellphone.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
         The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, ""SHIELD
         SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS."" Coulson eyes the screen.
         After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

                        COULSON
         It says here he's an M.D.

                        SELVIG
         He is. That is, he was. He
         switched careers and became a
         physicist. He's quite brilliant,
         really.

                        (THEN)
         If you would just release him to
         me, I promise to keep an eye on
         him.
         Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
         an AGENT nearby.

                        COULSON
         Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
         here.
         The Techie looks to him, surprised.

         COULSON (CONT'D)

                        (TO SELVIG)
         Make sure he stays in town for the
         next few days in case we need to
         talk to him again.
         Selvig shakes his hand.

                        SELVIG
         Thank you.

         92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A

         Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
         seated Thor.

                        SELVIG
         Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
         are!
         Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
         pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

         SELVIG (CONT'D)
         It's going to be all right, my
         friend. Come on, I'm taking you
         home.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A.
         He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

         92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B

         As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
         Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
         Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
         written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
         it from the pile and pockets it.

         92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C

         Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
         record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
         ""SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA."" He knows it's been a ruse
         all along.
         He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
         Room, then follows them outside.

         93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

         Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
         away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

                        COULSON
         Just keep him away from the bars.

                        SELVIG
         I will!

                        THOR

                        (TO SELVIG)
         Where are we going?
         Selvig drops his cool demeanor.

                        SELVIG
         To get a drink.
         Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
         As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
         GARRETT and CALE.

                        COULSON
         Follow them.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76.

         94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

         Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
         surface of the planet.

         95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95

         Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
         light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
         Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
         Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

                        LAUFEY
         Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

                        LOKI
         I've come alone and unarmed.

                        LAUFEY
         To what end?

                        LOKI
         To make you another proposition.

                        LAUFEY

                        (REALIZING)
         So you're the one who let us into
         Asgard.

                        LOKI
         You're welcome.

                        LAUFEY
         My men are dead, and I have no
         Casket. You are a deceiver.
         Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
         calmly stands his ground.

                        LOKI
         You have no idea what I am.
         The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
         guards stare in shock. Loki grins.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Hello, Father.
         Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
         Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.

                        LAUFEY
         Ah, the bastard son. I thought
         Odin had killed you. That's what I
         would have done. He's as weak as
         you are.

                        LOKI
         No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
         until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
         should not have so carelessly
         abandoned me.
         This gives Laufey pause.

                        LAUFEY
         Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
         I've ever made. I will hear you.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.

                        LOKI
         I will conceal you and a handful of
         your soldiers, lead you into his
         chambers, and let you slay him
         where he lies. I'll keep the
         throne, and you will have the
         Casket.
         Laufey studies Loki's face.

                        LAUFEY
         Why would you do this?

                        LOKI
         When all is done, we will have a
         permanent peace between our two
         worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
         will have accomplished what Odin
         and Thor never could.

                        LAUFEY
         This is a great day for Jotunheim.
         Asgard is finally ours.

                        LOKI
         No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
         the Nine Realms will be yours, if
         you do as you're told.
         Laufey considers the proposition.

                        LAUFEY
         I accept.
         Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
         smile crosses his face.

         96 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96

         Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
         his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

                        LOKI
         What troubles you, Gatekeeper?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.

                        HEIMDALL
         I turned my gaze upon you in
         Jotunheim, but could neither see
         nor hear you. You were shrouded
         from me, like the Frost Giants who
         entered this Realm.

                        LOKI
         Perhaps your senses have weakened
         after your many years of service.

                        HEIMDALL
         Or perhaps someone has found a way
         to hide that which he does not wish
         me to see.
         Loki sizes him up, smiles.

                        LOKI
         You have great power, Heimdall.
         Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

                        HEIMDALL
         No.

                        LOKI
         And why is that?

                        HEIMDALL
         Because he is my King, and I am
         sworn to obey him.

                        LOKI
         Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
         obey me now. Yes?
         A beat.

                        HEIMDALL
         Yes.

                        LOKI
         Good. Then you will open the
         Bifrost to no one until I have
         undone what my brother has started.
         Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
         him.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.

         97 INT. BAR - NIGHT 97

         Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
         The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
         of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
         Thor follows his example.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.

                        SELVIG
         Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
         but a talented hacker.

                        THOR
         Thank you for what you've done.

                        SELVIG
         Don't thank me. I only did it for 
         Jane.

                        THOR
         Are you in love with her?

                        SELVIG
         Of course not! Jane's like a
         daughter to me. Her father and I
         taught at University together. A
         good man, but he never listened.
         This registers with Thor.

                        THOR
         Neither did I.
         Selvig eyes him with interest.

                        SELVIG
         I don't know if you're really 
         delusional, and I really don't care 
         at this point. I just care about 
         her. I've seen the way she looks
         at you.

                        THOR
         I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

                        SELVIG
         Good. If that's the case, then
         I'll buy you one more drink, and 
         you'll leave town tonight. 
         A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.

                        THOR
         I had it all backwards. I had it
         all wrong.
         Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
         he's seen before.

                        SELVIG
         It's not a bad thing, finding out
         that you don't have all the
         answers. That's when you start
         asking the right questions.
         Thor takes this in.

                        THOR
         For the first time in my life, I
         have no idea what I'm supposed to
         do.

                        SELVIG
         Anyone who's ever going to find 
         their way in this world has to
         start by admitting they don't know
         where the hell they are.
         Thor nods.

         DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
         Hey, I know you, man... 
         An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one 
         of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
         approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.

         DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
         You were in the diner with that hot 
         girl.
         Thor doesn't like where this is going.

         DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
         I wouldn't mind her doing a little
         research on me.
         He laughs. Thor is annoyed.

                        THOR
         I have no quarrel with you. But 
         she's a lady. You should be more 
         respectful.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.

                         DRUNK TOWNIE
          And you should shut the hell up, 
          princess.
          Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
          But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's 
         baiting.

                         THOR 
          I will not fight him.

                         DRUNK TOWNIE 
          Then it'll be easy to kick your 
          ass. 
          Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

                         SELVIG
          Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
          heads. 
         Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
         Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
         glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.

         SELVIG (CONT'D)

                        (TO THOR)
         Another drink?

         98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98

         Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
         FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
         routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
         in time with the song.

                        THOR/SELVIG

                        (SINGING)
         ""The mood is good, our hearts are
         full, there's magic in the air. /
         It's all because we're here
         tonight, and haven't got a care. /
         So raise a glass, and toast to
         life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
         la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
         indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
         friend is fine indeed!""
         Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
         Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
         straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
         WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
         Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
         walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.

         99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99

         The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
         with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
         lies on her bed, trying to read.
         She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
         the door and opens it to find --

                        THOR
         Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
         shoulder.

                        JANE
         Erik!

                        (TO THOR)
         Is he all right?

                        THOR
         He's fine. Not injured at all.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
         As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
         Selvig GROANS.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Sorry, my friend.

                        JANE
         What happened?

                        THOR
         We drank. We fought. He made his
         ancestors proud.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.

                        JANE
         Put him on the bed.
         Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
         bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
         way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
         awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.

                        SELVIG
         I still don't believe you're the
         God of Thunder.

                        (THEN)
         But you ought to be.
         Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
         sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
         Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
         Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.

                        THOR
         These are your chambers?
         Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
         the mess around her.

                        JANE
         Well, it's more of a temporary
         living space, really. I don't
         usually have visitors in here.
         Actually, never...
         Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
         him, puts it away.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         Can we go outside?

         100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100

         Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
         offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
         up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

                        JANE
         I come up here sometimes when I
         can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
         reconcile particle data. Or when
         Darcy's driving me crazy.

                        (THEN)
         I come up here a lot, now that I
         think about it.
         Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         I'm glad you're safe.

                        THOR
         You've been very kind. I've been
         far less grateful than you deserve.

                        JANE
         I also hit you with my car a couple
         times, so it kind of evens out.
         He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

         NOTEBOOK.

         JANE (CONT'D)
         I don't believe it...
         She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.

                        THOR
         It was all I could get back. Not
         as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

                        JANE
         No, this is good. Thank you. This
         means I don't have to start from
         scratch...
         She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
         harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

                        THOR
         What's wrong?

                        JANE
         SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
         never going to let this research
         see the light of day.

                        THOR
         You must do this. You must finish
         what you've started.

                        JANE
         Why?

                        THOR
         Because you're right. It's taken
         so many generations for your people
         to get to this point. You're
         nearly there. You just need
         someone to show you how close you
         really are.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
         Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
         which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
         the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
         point to another in space.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Look -- your ancestors called it
         magic. You call it science. I
         come from a place where they're one
         and the same thing.
         We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
         as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.

                        JANE
         What is it?

                        THOR
         This is how my father explained it
         to me...

                        (THEN)
         Your world is one of the Nine
         Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
         each other by the branches of
         Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
         you see it every day, without
         realizing. Images glimpsed through
         -- what did you call it?...
         (checks her notebook)
         ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
         Realms...
         They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
         going to be a long night.

         101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101

         Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
         stares up at the night sky.
         She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
         looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
         the town beyond her.

         102 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

         Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
         nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
         as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
         stand it no more.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.

                        FANDRAL
         Our dearest friend banished, Loki
         on the throne, Asgard on the brink
         of war, yet you manage to consume
         four wild boar, six pheasant, a
         side of beef, and two casks of ale.
         Shame on you! Don't you care?!
         Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
         pulls his weapon, stopping him.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Do not mistake my appetite for
         apathy.

                        SIF
         Stop it, both of you! We all know
         what we have to do, we're just too
         damned afraid to do it!

                        HOGUN

                        (DECIDES)
         We must go. We must find Thor.
         Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
         fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.

                        FANDRAL
         It's treason, Hogun.

                        VOLSTAGG
         To hell with treason, it's suicide.

                        (SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
         Now, shh! Heimdall may be
         watching! It's said he can hear--

                        FANDRAL
         Yes, yes, we know!

                        SIF
         Thor would do the same for us.
         An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

                        EINHERJAR GUARD
         Heimdall demands your presence.
         Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.

                        VOLSTAGG
         We're doomed.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84A.

         103 EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 103

         Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.

         104 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - DAY 104

         Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
         against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
         He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

         105 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105

         Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
         emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
         Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:

                        SELVIG
         I need some coffee.
         The three head inside Smith Motors.

         FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
         SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
         small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

         105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A

         Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
         holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
         scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
         table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

                        DARCY
         Thanks.

                        THOR
         You're very welcome.
         Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
         She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
         breakfast, looking like a little family.

                        106 OMITTED 106

          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86.

         108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108

         On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
         and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
         wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
         with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
         turns to Cale.

                        AGENT GARRETT
         They want an update.

                        AGENT CALE
         Tell them he's eating eggs.

                        AGENT GARRETT
         Scrambled or fried?
         Cale glares at him.

                        AGENT CALE

                        (INTO COMM-LINK)
         Target is eating eggs, sir.
         We'll keep you posted.

         108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA

         As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
         hand, gets an idea.

                        THOR

                        (RE: MUG)
         May I have this?

                        DARCY
         Sure.

                        THOR
         Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
         Thor leaves.

         108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A

         In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
         (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
         tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
         She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
         suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.

                        THOR
         To replace the one I broke. Please
         forgive my behavior.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
         She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

                        ISABEL
         Okay. Thank you.

                        THOR
         If I may, I'd like to come back for
         more of your ""coffee.""

                        ISABEL
         Any time.
         He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
         shrugs.

         ISABEL (CONT'D)
         She could do worse.

         109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

         Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
         intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
         controls. He glares at them accusingly.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Good Heimdall, less us explain--

                        HEIMDALL
         You would defy the commands of Loki
         our King, break every oath you have
         taken as warriors, and commit
         treason to bring Thor back?
         The four exchange nervous glances.

                        SIF
         Yes, but--

                        HEIMDALL
         Good.
         The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

                        VOLSTAGG
         So you'll help us?

                        HEIMDALL
         I am bound by honor to our King. I
         cannot open the Bifrost to you.
         With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
         The others exchange puzzled looks.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.

                        FANDRAL
         Complicated fellow, isn't he?

                        VOLSTAGG
         Now what do we do?
         Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.

                        SIF
         Look!
         The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
         control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
         Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

         110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110

         Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
         footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

                        COULSON
         What the hell was that?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.

                        TECHIE
         I don't know, sir. We got massive
         energy readings out of nowhere,
         then they just disappeared.
         Fifteen miles due northwest.

                        COULSON
         Let's go take a look.

         111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

         Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
         Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
         clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
         hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
         cover the desert sand around them.

                        VOLSTAGG
         He must have landed nearby. It's
         time to put our tracking skills to
         work. Spread out. Check the sand
         for indentations of his boot
         prints.

                        FANDRAL
         The winds would have blown them
         away by now. We should look for
         signs of a campfire.

                        SIF
         Or we could just start there.
         She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
         distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
         Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
         and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.

                        FANDRAL
         It's worth a look, I suppose.
         The party tromps towards the town.

         112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

          Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
          they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

         113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

          A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
          runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
          of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
          dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
          up with one hand.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.
          Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
          hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.

                         VOLSTAGG 
          There you go, lad!
          The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head 
         off.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         Is it just me, or does Earth look a
         little different to you?

                        SIF
         It has been a thousand years...

                        VOLSTAGG
         Things change so fast here. You
         leave for a millennium, and it's
         like the whole neighborhood's gone.
         Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         Perhaps we should split up.

         114 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO - ROOFTOP - DAY 114







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89.
         Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
         down the street.

                        AGENT GARRETT
         Is there a Renaissance Faire in
         town?

                        AGENT CALE
         Call it in.
         But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
         their heads together. They're out.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Never cared for spies.
         He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
         ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
         bite. He likes what he tastes.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         Exquisite.

         115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115

         Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
         Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

                        EINHERJAR GUARD
         My liege, the Warriors Three and
         the Lady Sif have gone missing.
         Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.

         116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116

         Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

                        HEIMDALL
         Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
         Jotuns into Asgard?

                        LOKI
         You think the Bifrost is the only
         way in and out of the Realm? There
         are secret paths between worlds to
         which even you with all your gifts
         are blind. But I have need of them
         no longer, now that I am King.

                        (THEN)
         And I say, for your act of treason,
         you are relieved of your duties as
         Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
         a citizen of Asgard.

                        HEIMDALL
         Then I need no longer obey you.
         Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
         Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
         something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
         quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --

         THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
         The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
         opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
         From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
         the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
         SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
         towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
         still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
         Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
         massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
         just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
         relief and steps past him.

         117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117

         Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
         opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
         appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
         its head toward its King.

                        LOKI
         Ensure my brother does not return.

         118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118

          Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
          up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
         utensils away.
         The door opens.

          VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
          Found you!
         Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

         SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
         Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
         dishes in mortal clothing.
         Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90A.

                        THOR
         My friends!
         Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
         Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
         room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
         wonder.

                        SELVIG
         I don't believe it...

                        DARCY
         Who are they?

                        VOLSTAGG
         Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
         Surely you've heard tales of Hogun
         the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
         I, Volstagg the Svelte?
         Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.

         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
         Well, perhaps I've put on a little
         more muscle since I was here last.

                        JANE 
         That would have been a thousand 
         years ago? Northern Europe?

                        VOLSTAGG 
         Exactly! Those lovely herring 
         people. They worshipped us! 
         Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.

                        THOR
         My friends, I've never been happier 
         to see anyone. But you should not
         have come.

                        FANDRAL
         We're here to take you home.
         Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

                        THOR
         You know I can't. My father is 
         dead because of me. I must remain
         in exile.
         The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

                        SIF
         Thor... your father still lives.
         Thor reacts to the revelation.

         119 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 119

         A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
         SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
         Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
         Agent.

                        COULSON
         Get somebody from Linguistics out
         here.
         Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
         storm ROARS in the sky above.
         Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
         vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
         strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
         the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
         desert floor.
         Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

                        DARCY
         Was somebody else coming?
         Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.

         122 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 122

         From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
         the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
         moves towards them.

                        SHIELD AGENT

                        (RE: DESTROYER)
         Is that one of Stark's?

                        COULSON
         I don't think so. But the guy
         doesn't tell me anything.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93.
         Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the
         Destroyer.

         COULSON (CONT'D)
         Hello! You're using unregistered
         weapons technology. Please
         identify yourself.
         We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
         inside.

         COULSON (CONT'D)
         Incoming!
         As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
         from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
         fire.

         123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123

         Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
         the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
         Thor turns to Jane.

                        THOR
         Leave this town now. Get yourself
         and your friends to safety.

                        JANE
         What about you?

                        THOR
         I must stay and fight.
         The Asgardians look to Thor.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         I'm still a warrior, and I will
         fight by your side.

                        VOLSTAGG
         You're but a mortal now. You'll
         get yourself killed!

                        FANDRAL
         Or one of us, trying to protect

         The best thing you can do is get
         the mortals to safety and leave the
         battle to us.
         Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the
         oncoming threat.

                        THOR

                        (TO SIF)
         You're right.
         Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Help me clear the streets. I'll
         let none of these people die this
         day.
         Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
         Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head
         across town, towards the Destroyer.

         Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and
         step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls
         Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant
         apparatus slows to a stop.

         125A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 125A

         The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The
         smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about.

         Thor, Jane, and Selvig clear the streets, loading confused

         127 EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - DAY 127

         A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in
         front of it. Then we see it --

                        THE DESTROYER
         Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from
         within it.
         It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting
         storefronts aflame.

         Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors
         Three get into position before the Destroyer.

                        THOR

                        (TO JANE)
         My friends fight bravely, but they
         won't be able to hold it back much

         Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many
         animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.

         DOWN THE STREET
         Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as
         Volstagg stands limbering up.

                        FANDRAL

                        (TO VOLSTAGG)
         Come on!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A.
         Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
         As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
         on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the
         voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

                        VOLSTAGG
         For Asgaaaaard!!!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97.
         The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
         SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
         work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
         lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
         apologetically.
         The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
         smashing into them, when --

                        SIF
         Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
         plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
         The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
         faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
         brief moment of hope.
         But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
         again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
         Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
         degrees to face its attackers.
         The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
         of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
         rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
         staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
         Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
         unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
         in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
         free, landing in the middle of the street.

         131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

         Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
         time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
         A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
         and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
         they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
         impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

                        JANE
         Erik!
         She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
         into shock.

                        SELVIG

                        (TO JANE)
         Go! Leave me!

         Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
         stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
         for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
         pouch and races back.
         He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
         useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

                        THOR
         Come on... give me one!
         Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
         intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
         the end of the iron rod.

                        JANE
         What are you doing? What is that?
         As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
         Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
         piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
         reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
         completely.
         Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
         lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
         reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
         flesh.

                        SELVIG
         (to Jane, re: Thor)
         I'm really starting to like him.
         Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.

         132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

         Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
         the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

                        THOR
         Go, while you can!

                        SIF
         But the others...

                        THOR
         You can't help them now. Your job
         is to survive.
         She struggles to sit up.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.

                        SIF
         No! I will die a warrior's death.
         Stories will be told of this day--
         He gently takes her shield from her.

                        THOR
         Live and tell those stories
         yourself.
         At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
         with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
         towards them.
         Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
         safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
         and Fandral.

         THOR (CONT'D)

                        (RE: VOLSTAGG)
         Get him out of here!

                        FANDRAL
         No. We can still fight!

                        THOR
         But not win. Move Volstagg, or
         he'll die!
         Thor looks at them, grins.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Don't worry, my friends. I have a
         plan.
         The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
         drag him away from the battlefield.
         After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
         tosses Sif's shield aside.
         He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
         defenseless.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Brother... for whatever I have done
         to wrong you, whatever I have done
         to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
         But these people have done nothing
         to you. They are innocents.
         He continues towards the Destroyer.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         Take my life, and know I will never
         return to Asgard.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
         Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
         The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
         swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
         of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
         Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
         Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
         The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
         a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
         Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

                        SELVIG
         Jane, no!
         He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
         watching the scene --

         133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133

         Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
         A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.

         134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134

         Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
         Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
         him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
         unleash its fiery blast.

         135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135

         Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
         burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
         hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
         vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
         Clouds form in the sky above.
         Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
         straight up into the air like a rocket.

         136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136

         The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

         KRAKAKABOOM!
         A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
         colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
         massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
         enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

                        JANE
         Oh. My. God.

         THE MIGHTY THOR
         Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
         the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
         down onto the ground.

         KRAKABOOM!
         Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
         Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
         Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
         God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
         force winds.
         Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
         Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
         It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
         locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
         straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
         Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
         overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
         Destroyer.
         Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
         The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
         within him, firing out of all his openings.
         Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
         heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
         Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
         lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
         pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
         skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
         Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
         A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

                        COULSON
         Donald... I don't think you've been
         completely honest with me.

         137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137

         Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
         the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
         Darcy turns to Volstagg.

                        DARCY
         So, how can you speak our language?

                        VOLSTAGG
         Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
         you're speaking ours.
         Thor calls up to the sky.

                        THOR
         Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

         138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138

         Heimdall stands frozen.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.

         139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139

         Thor looks to the others with concern.

                        THOR
         He would open it if he could. I
         fear the worst.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Then we're trapped here forever.

                        FANDRAL
         Then I suppose we'd best start
         settling into our new lives.
         He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
         Are all earth maidens as fair as
         you?
         Darcy enjoys the attention.

                        DARCY
         No.
         Thor shouts back up to the sky.

                        THOR
         Heimdall!

         140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140

         From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
         Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
         all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
         a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
         Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
         Observatory.

         141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141

         The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
         Agent's machine gun.

                        VOLSTAGG
         Primitive. Good enough for hunting
         small game, I suppose.
         Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
         grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.

                        FANDRAL
         Sorry, my love. These things
         happen.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
         He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
         Coulson.

                        THOR
         Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
         we fight for the same cause -- the
         protection of this world. From
         this day forward, count me as your
         ally.

                        (THEN)
         If you return the items you have
         stolen from Jane Foster.

                        COULSON
         Not stolen. Borrowed.
         Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.

         COULSON (CONT'D)
         You'll get your equipment back.
         You're going to need it to continue
         your research... which, after
         today's events, SHIELD would like
         to fully sponsor. If that's all
         right with you.
         Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
         him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
         again.

                        THOR
         Whatever fate lies before me, you
         are part of it.
         He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
         the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

         142 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 142

         The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
         slumped over his controls.

                        THOR
         (to the others)
         Get him to the healing room! Leave
         my brother to me.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104.
         Thor bolts out the door.

         143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143

         Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
         the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
         grabs a sword.
         A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
         cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
         Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
         Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

         144 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 144

         Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
         palace.

         145 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 145

         The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
         the moment.
         He forms an ICE BLADE.

         146 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 146

         Thor races through the entrance to the palace.

         147 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 147

         Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

                        LAUFEY
         It's said you can still see and
         hear what transpires around you,
         even in this state. I hope it's
         true, so that you may know your
         death came by the hand of Laufey.
         He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

         A BLAST OF ENERGY
         Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
         we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
         Gungnir.

                        LOKI
         And your death came by the son of
         Odin.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.
         Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
         Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
         taking him out.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.
         The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
         his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

                        REVEALING --

                        FRIGGA
         Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
         looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         I swear to you, mother, they will
         pay for what they've done today. I
         will end the Jotun threat, now and
         forever!
         He looks to Odin.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         And I will make you proud.
         Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
         in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
         and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
         respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

                        FRIGGA
         Thor!
         She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
         on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

                        LOKI
         Found its way back to you, did it?

                        THOR
         No thanks to you.
         Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

                        FRIGGA
         What?

                        THOR
         Why don't you tell her? How you
         sent the Destroyer to kill our
         friends? To kill me?
         Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

                        LOKI
         It must have been enforcing
         Father's last command.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.

                        THOR
         You're a talented liar, brother.
         Always have been.

                        LOKI

                        (SMILES)
         It's good to have you back.

                        (DEAD SERIOUS)
         Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
         destroy Jotunheim.
         Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
         Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
         walls, into...

         148 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 148

         Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
         opposite side of the corridor, to...

         149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149

         Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
         pools below.

         150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150

         Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
         quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.

         151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151

         Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
         spins, points.

         152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152

         Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
         the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
         looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.

                        THOR
         Jotunheim...

         153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153

         Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
         energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
         He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.

         154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154

         Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
         Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
         He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
         enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

                        LOKI
         All these years, and no one's ever
         dared to use it as a weapon.
         Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
         it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
         fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
         blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
         ice as Thor staggers to his feet.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         You can't stop it. The Bifrost
         will build until it rips Jotunheim
         apart.

                        THOR
         Why have you done this?

                        LOKI
         To do what Father never could. To
         destroy their kind forever. When
         he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
         what I've done.

                        THOR
         He won't! You can't kill an entire
         race!

                        LOKI
         What is this newfound love for the
         Frost Giants? You, who would have
         killed them all with your bare
         hands.

                        THOR
         I've changed.

                        LOKI
         So have I.
         Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Fight me.
         He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
         hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
         but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
         towards the frozen controls.
         Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
         immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.

                        THOR
         Is the throne really worth what
         you've done? What you would
         become?

                        LOKI
         I never wanted the throne. I only
         wanted to be your equal. Now fight
         me!







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
         With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
         Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

                        THOR
         I will not fight you, brother.

                        LOKI
         I am not your brother. I never
         was.

                        THOR
         Loki, this is madness...
         Loki grins.

                        LOKI
         Is it?
         He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
         his feet.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         What happened to you on earth that
         turned you so soft? Don't tell me
         it was a woman.
         Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         It was. Perhaps when we're
         finished here I'll pay her a little
         visit myself.
         That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
         their weapons collide.
         The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
         jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

         155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155

         It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
         the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
         JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
         ice.

         156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156

          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
          hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
         it.

                         SELVIG
         Jane?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A.

                        JANE
         Something's wrong.







          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109.

         157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157

         Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
         Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
         hand.
         The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
         Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
         back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
         powerful.
         Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
         towards the Bifrost.

                        LOKI
         If you care so much for the Jotuns,
         then die with them.
         The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
         drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
         concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
         towards the Bifrost.
         MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
         The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
         blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
         brother.

         158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158

         Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
         land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
         to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

                        LOKI
         Thor! Help me!
         Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
         up at him desperately.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Please...
         Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
         brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
         then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
         around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
         Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
         him across the bridge.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
         Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
         him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
         It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
         to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
         Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
         never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
         Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

                        LOKIS
         I was always more clever than you.

                        THOR
         Yet still not clever enough.
         With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
         summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
         channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
         Lokis.
         All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
         Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
         knocked from his grasp.
         Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
         back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
         away.
         Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
         confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
         his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
         pinned to the ground.
         Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
         towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
         energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
         do.
         Loki watches him smugly.

                        LOKI
         Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
         With all your strength, what good
         does it do you now?
         Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
         happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
         VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
         feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
         He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
         Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
         hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
         Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
         thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
         channels the power of the storm into it, then --
         He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
         massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
         the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
         where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         Stop! What are you doing?!
         Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
         The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
         out from it. Loki thinks fast.

         LOKI (CONT'D)
         If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
         never see her again!
         Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
         through the back.

                        THOR
         Forgive me.
         Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
         Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
         sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
         KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
         out of it.
         Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
         the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
         Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
         The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
         As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
         Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
         towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
         from the broken Bridge.
         They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
         force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
         by the debris, when --

         A POWERFUL HAND
         Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
         as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

                        SEE --







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.

                        ODIN ALLFATHER
         Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
         Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
         Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
         approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
         disappointment and regret.
         Loki lets go.

         THOR (CONT'D)
         No!
         But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
         falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
         him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
         Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
         Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
         into his father's arms.

                        ODIN
         It is over.

         159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
         The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
         in all directions.
         Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
         Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
         significance of what's just happened.

                        JANE
         It's gone.

         160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160

         A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
         sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
         Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
         their battle with the Destroyer.

                        VOLSTAGG
         ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
         I flew at the great metal beast and
         laid it low...







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.

                        FANDRAL
         Is that another way of saying you
         fell on your huge a--

                        VOLSTAGG
         As a matter of fact, falling down
         was a tactic. Lulling the
         Destroyer into a false sense of
         security!

                        FANDRAL
         Well, I was the one who had to drag
         your enormous carcass off the
         battlefield. That makes me the
         real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
         Hogun points to Volstagg.

                        HOGUN
         Big stomach.
         (points to Fandral)
         Big mouth.
         The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
         look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
         smile.

                        FANDRAL
         Well, how about that? A smile!
         I'd say that calls for another
         drink!
         They laugh and raise another round.
         Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
         sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
         Frigga, bows her head.

                        SIF
         My Queen. I am so sorry for your
         loss.
         Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

                        FRIGGA
         Thank you, Sif.
         She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
         him.

         FRIGGA (CONT'D)
         How is he?







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.

                        SIF
         He mourns for his brother. And he
         misses her. The mortal.
         Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
         Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.

                        FRIGGA
         He will need his friends now more
         than ever.

                        SIF
         I will always be at his side.
         Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.

         161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161

         Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
         walks up behind him.

                        ODIN
         You'll be a wise King.

                        THOR
         There will never be a wiser king
         than you. Or a better father.

                        (THEN)
         I have much to learn. I know that
         now. But some day, perhaps, I will
         make you proud.

                        ODIN
         You've already made me proud.
         Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

         162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162

         Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
         energy, drifting off into space.
         Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
         Thor stares out at the stellar void.







         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.

                        THOR
         Can you see her?
         Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.

                        HEIMDALL
         Yes.

                        THOR
         How is she?

         163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163

         Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
         ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
         away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
         inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
         that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
         facility, abuzz with activity.
         SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
         the-art equipment.
         Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
         SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
         windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
         roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
         hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
         before her, which bears the ""STARK INDUSTRIES"" logo.
         From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.

                        DARCY
         Here you go.

                        JANE
         Thanks.
         Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

                        DARCY
         He would have come back if he
         could.

                        JANE
         I know. But if he can't get here
         on his own...
         Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
         HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
         bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
         YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

2 INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME 2

    Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through
    iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.

    It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That
    rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road.

    He awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around.

                          THOR
                Now I know what you're thinking.
                Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did
                this happen?
                    (then:)
                Well, sometimes you have to get
                captured just to get a straight
                answer out of somebody. It's a long
                story but basically I'm a bit of a
                hero. See, I spent some time on
                earth, fought some robots, saved
                the planet a couple of times. Then
                I went searching through the cosmos
                for some magic, colorful Infinity
                Stone things... didn't find any.
                That's when I came across a path of
                death and destruction which led me
                all the way here into this cage...
                where I met you.

                be here?

    NOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING.

    Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK!
    Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six
    feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in-

3 INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 3

   A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are
   molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it.
   Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and
   sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.

                       SURTUR (O.S.)
             Thor, Son of Odin.

   Thor's chain turns to reveal-

   -SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of
   fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.

                        THOR
             Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're
             still alive! I thought my father
             killed you, like, half a million
             years ago.

                       SURTUR
             I cannot die. Not until I fulfill
             my destiny and lay waste to your
             home.

                       THOR
             You know, it's funny you should
             mention that because I've been
             having these terrible dreams of
             late. Asgard up in flames, falling
             to ruins, and you Surtur are at the
             center of all of them.

                       SURTUR
             Then you have seen Ragnarok, the
             fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--

                        THOR (O.S.)
             Hang on.   Hang on.

   Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                       THOR (CONT'D)
             I'll be back around shortly. I
             really feel like we were connecting
             there.

   After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.

                       THOR (CONT'D)
             Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about
             that. Walk me through it.
                      BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16           3.



                   SURTUR
         My time has come. When my crown is
         reunited with the Eternal Flame, I
         shall be restored to my full might.
         I will tower over the mountains and
         bury my sword deep in Asgard's--

                   THOR
         Oh, hang on. Give it a second.

Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         I swear I'm not even moving, it's
         just doing this on its own. I'm
         really sorry.
             (then:)
         Okay, let me get this straight.
         You're going to put your crown into
         the Eternal Flame, and then you'll
         suddenly grow as big as a house--

                   SURTUR
         A mountain!

                   THOR
         The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
         locked away on Asgard?

Surtur grins, evil.

                   SURTUR
         Odin is not on Asgard. And your
         absence has left the throne
         defenseless.

That elicits a concerned look from Thor.

                   THOR
         Okay, so where is it? This crown?

                   SURTUR
         This is my Crown, the source of my
         power.

Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..

                   THOR
         Oh, that's a crown? I thought it
         was a big eyebrow.

                   SURTUR
         It's a crown.
                      BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   4.



                    THOR
          Anyway, it sounds like all I have
          to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that
          thing off your head.

Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.

                    SURTUR
          But Ragnarok has   already begun. You
          cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's
          doom, and so are   you. All will
          suffer, all will   burn.

Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet,
holding it so he and Thor are face to face.

                    THOR
          That's intense. To be honest,
          seeing you grow really big and set
          fire to a planet would be quite the
          spectacle. But it looks like I'm
          going to have to go with option B
          where I bust out of these chains,
          knock that tiara off your head, and
          stash it away in Asgard's vault.

                    SURTUR
          You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight
          it?

Behind his back, Thor opens his hand. Sending out the SOS.

                    THOR
          Because that's what heroes do.

Nothing happens. Thor appears annoyed at himself.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Wait, sorry. I didn't time that
          right.
              (pause)
          And, now!

BOOM! Thor's hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall!
Thor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, and
flies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur,
smashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.

                    SURTUR
          You have made a grave mistake,
          Odinson.
                          BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   5.



   THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE
   DEMONS rally to Surtur's aid.

                        THOR
              I make grave mistakes all the time.
              Everything seems to work out.

   In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS.

   The fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERING
   AWAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and-

   -LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwave
   KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS.

   The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash.

   Thor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hands
   at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE!

   Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD.

   The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious
   hand-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sending
   sparks of both fire and electricity into the air.

   Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor then
   LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT.
   Descending hard, he uses all his power to-

   -LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATES
   and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones.

   Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find-

   -the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood
   in, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat,
   Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Heimdall. I know it's been a while,
              but I could use a fast exit!

   Nothing.   Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              ...Heimdall?


4 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME 4

   Heimdall is nowhere to be found. Instead, we meet SKURGE.
   He's bald, strong, mean looking, a little eager to be liked.
                         BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    6.



   At the moment, Skurge is entertaining two ASGARDIAN WOMEN.

                        SKURGE
             Heimdall was an idiot. This job
             should have made him rich. Now,
             the job ain't easy, but it does
             have its benefits. The Bi-Frost
             gives me access to everything the
             Nine Realms have to offer. I mean
             it's all mine for the taking.
                 (beat)
             Behold...my stuff.

   Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons and
   treasures he has stashed off to the side.

   He hefts up two M-16 assault rifles, trying to play it cool.

                       SKURGE (CONT'D)
             I'm particularly fond of these. I
             pulled `em out of a place on
             Midgard called Texas. I even named
             them. Des and Troy. You see, when
             you put them together...they
             destroy.


5 INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 5

   Having expected to have been Bi-Frosted out of there, Thor is
   OVERRUN BY THE GIANT WAVE OF FIRE DEMONS!

   The Fire Dragon BREAKS FREE of its chain.

   Realizing he's in trouble, Thor TAKES OFF, rocketing up to-


6 EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS 6

   Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface.
   Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught.

   Thor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the
   flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.

                       THOR
             Heimdall, come on.

   THE GROUND SHAKES! Like an earthquake. Thor backs up as the
   ground begins to give way all around him. And then-

   -THE FEARSOME FIRE DRAGON BURSTS OUT OF THE GROUND! The
   dragon opens its tremendous jaws for an ear-splitting roar...
                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 7.



    ...but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go.

    THUD! The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its bottom
    jaw. It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Stay.
                  (looks up to the sky:)
              I'm running short on--

    Thor notices that all around him the ground is CRUMBLING like
    a field of sinkholes giving way to more snarling Fire Demons!

                          THOR (CONT'D)
              -options.

    Thor calls for Mjolnir and TAKES OFF.   The dragon SCREECHES!

9 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME 9

    Skurge continues showing off for the ladies.

                          THOR (O.S.)
              Heimdall?

    Behind Skurge the Bi-Frost starts MOVING.   One of the women
    notices the Bi-Frost glowing.

                        ASGARDIAN WOMAN
              Skurge, is that important?

    Skurge turns and notices the Bi-Frost activity.

                        SKURGE
              You girls are in for a treat.

    Angle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast aside
    in another pile of ""stuff."" Skurge hastily runs and grabs it.


10 EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS 10

    Thor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on his
    heels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below!

    Thor looks back, genuinely nervous. The dragon is OPENING
    its jaws to swallow Thor whole when-

    -Suddenly Bi-Frost OPENS! The portal surrounds Thor and
    engulfs the dragon's head! In an instant, they're gone.
                          BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 8.



                         MAIN TITLE


11 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER 11

    Skurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost.

    BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed
    head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on
    Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore.

    The dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to
    rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock.

    The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor
    meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks
    up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself.

                         SKURGE
              Girls!
                  (beat)
              Well well, look who decided to pop
              in. Thanks for scaring away my
              company and drenching my workplace
              in brains.

                        THOR
              Who are you?

                        SKURGE
              Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
                  (Thor doesn't)
              We fought together on Vanaheim.

                         THOR
              Right.   Where's Heimdall?

                        SKURGE
              That traitor. No one knows, he's a
              fugitive of the throne.

                         THOR
              Traitor?

                        SKURGE
              Yeah, you see, Odin charged
              Heimdall with negligence of duty,
              but he disappeared before the
              trial. Hard to catch a guy who can
              see everything in the Universe.

    Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he
    starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way.
                             BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  9.



                            THOR
               Sure.

                         SKURGE
               Hold on. I'm supposed to announce
               your arrival.

     Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.   Skurge starts
     the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge.

A13 EXT. THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY A13

     THOR arrives with Surtur's skull.

     There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over
     which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched
     in the `savior' pose.

     Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.

                         THOR
               What the hell is that?


13 EXT. ASGARD - ROYAL TERRACE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER 13

     LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's
     not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY.

     In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score
     from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute.

     Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.

                         ACTOR LOKI
               Oh, brother. This is it.    I take
               my leave.

                         ACTOR THOR
               You fool, you didn't listen!

                            ACTOR LOKI
               I'm sorry.

                            ACTOR THOR
               Lady Sif!     Get help!

     ""Sif"" awkwardly runs off. The ""Warriors Three"" watch sadly. A
     small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO.

                         ACTOR SIF
               Somebody help!
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                10.


In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a
chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show.
Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         Sorry for all I've done.

                   ACTOR THOR
         It's all right.   Hold on.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

                   ACTOR THOR
         They'd be lucky to have you.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         I'm sorry about that thing with the
         Tesseract. I just couldn't help
         myself.

                   ACTOR THOR
         I know.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         I'm a trickster.

                   ACTOR THOR
         So mischievous.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         Sorry about that time I turned you
         into a frog.

                   ACTOR THOR
         It was a wonderful joke.

                   ODIN
             (to no-one in particular)
         Twas indeed hilarious.

                   ACTOR THOR
         You are the savior of Asgard.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         Tell my story.

                   ACTOR THOR
         I will.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         Build a statue for me.
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                11.



                   ACTOR THOR
         We will build a big statue for you.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         With my helmet on, with the big
         bendy horns.

                   ACTOR THOR
         I will tell Father what you did
         here today.

Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.

                   ACTOR LOKI
         I didn't do it for him.

Actor Loki then ""dies"".

                      ACTOR THOR
         Noooooo!!!

The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.

                   ACTOR ODIN
         And so Loki died of his wounds,
         giving his life for ours. He
         fought back those disgusting dark
         elves. He brought peace to the
         realm.

He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.

                   ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
         Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago
         I found you on a frost-bitten
         battlefield.

Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next
to him is openly SOBBING at the play.

                   ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
         On that day, I did not yet see in
         you Asgard's savior. No. You were
         merely a little blue baby icicle...
         that melted this old fool's heart.

The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin
stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.

                     ODIN
         Bravo!    Bravo! Well done.   Bravo.

                      THOR
         Father.
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   12.


Odin sees Thor taking a knee. Curses under his breath:

                   ODIN
         Oh, shit.
             (then, announcing)
         My son! Thor has returned!
         Greetings my boy.

Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His
fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats
away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.

                    THOR
         It's an interesting play.    What's
         it called?

                   ODIN
         The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The
         people wanted to commemorate him.

                   THOR
         Indeed they should.
             (provoking)
         I like that statue. A lot better
         looking than he was when he was
         alive, though. A little less
         weasely. Less greasy maybe.

Odin sours, masking his agitation. Thor holds up the skull.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         You know what this is?

                   ODIN (ADR)
         The skull of Surtur? That's a
         formidable weapon.

Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.

                   THOR
         Do me a favor. Lock this in a
         vault so it doesn't turn into a
         giant monster and destroy the whole
         planet.

                   ODIN
         So it's back to Midgard for you, is
         it?

Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.

                   THOR
         Nope. I've been having this
         reocurring dream lately.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Every night I see Asgard fall into
         ruins...

                   ODIN
         That's just a silly dream... Signs
         of an overactive imagination.

                   THOR
         Possibly... but then I decide to go
         out there and investigate. And
         what do I find, but the Nine Realms
         completely in chaos. Enemies of
         Asgard assembling, plotting our
         demise, all while you, Odin, the
         protector of those Nine Realms, are
         sitting here in your bathrobe,
         eating grapes.

                   ODIN
         Well, it is best to respect our
         neighbors' freedom.

                    THOR
         Of course, the freedom to be
         massacred.

                   ODIN
         Yes, besides, I have been rather
         busy myself.

                   THOR
         Watching theatre.

                   ODIN
         Board meetings, and security
         council meetings...

                   THOR
         You really going to make me do it?

                    ODIN
         Do what?

Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance,
GRABS Odin by the back of the neck.
Odin's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherjar
bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.

                   THOR
         You know that nothing will stop
         Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

Mjolnir stops mid-air and starts ROCKETING BACK.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Not even your face.

                   ODIN
         You've gone quite mad.     You'll be
         executed for this!

Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles.

                   THOR
         Then I'll see you on the other
         side...brother.

The jig is up. A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:

                   LOKI
         Alright, I yield!

Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki
looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the
scene, a little late to warn Loki.

                    SKURGE
         Behold!   Thor..Odinson.

                   LOKI
         You had one job!    Just the one.

                   THOR
         Where's Odin?

                   LOKI
         You just couldn't stay away, could
         you? Everything was fine without
         you. Asgard was prospering
             (gestures to the crowd)
         You've ruined everything. Ask
         them.

Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier.
Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.

                   THOR
         Where's father?    Did you kill him?

                   LOKI
         You had what you wanted, you had
         the independence you asked for!

Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest.

17 EXT. SHADY ACRES NURSING HOME - MANHATTAN - DAY 17

    A NURSING HOME sign on a brick wall. Suddenly the wall
    crumbles out of shot, revealing a demolition site.

    Reveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries an
    umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit.

                        LOKI
              I swear, I left him right here.

                        THOR
              Right here on the sidewalk? Or
              right there, where the building
              that's being demolished? Great
              planning.

                        LOKI
              How was I supposed to know? Can't

                        THOR
              Then why do you dress like one?

                        THOR
              I can't believe you're alive. I saw
              you die. I mourned you, I cried for
              you.

              I'm honored.

              Sure.
                  (to Loki:)
              Start figuring out where he is.

                        COLLEGE GIRL 1
              Oh, my god.

                        COLLEGE GIRL 2
              Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

                        THOR
              She didn't dump me, you know.       I
              dumped her. It was a mutual
              dumping.

    Thor notices something going on around Loki.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              What's this, what are you doing!?

    Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW
    BENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols.

                        LOKI
              This... isn't me.

    WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid
    concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was.

    Thor pokes the business card.

                        THOR
              Loki?

    He picks up the card.    It reads:

                        177A Bleecker Street

    Thor picks up the card and - WHOOSH!

                   STRANGE (O.S.)
         Thor Odinson.

From a dark corner we glimpse a shape - DOCTOR STRANGE.
Levitating, he drifts towards Thor.

                   STRANGE (CONT'D)
         God of Thunder.

Thor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself.

                   STRANGE (CONT'D)
         You can put down the umbrella.

Thor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrella
down. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished.

                   THOR
         So earth has wizards now?

                   STRANGE
         The preferred term is ""Master of
         the Mystic Arts.""

                   THOR
         Alright wizard, who are you?   Why
         should I care?

                   STRANGE
         My name is Doctor Stephen Strange
         and I have some questions for you.
         Take a seat.

Thor and Strange are now sitting in high-backed chairs.

                    STRANGE (CONT'D)
         Tea?

Thor now has a cup of tea in his hand.

                   THOR
         I don't drink tea.

                   STRANGE
         What do you drink?

                    THOR
         Not tea.

Thor now has a stein of beer in his hand. He drinks it
throughout the scene, but it always stays full.

         STRANGE

So I keep a watch list of
individuals and beings from other
realms that may be a threat to this
world. Your adopted brother Loki
is one of these beings.

         THOR

He's a worthy inclusion.

         STRANGE

Then why bring him here?

         THOR

We're looking for my father.

         STRANGE

So. If you were to tell you where
Odin was, all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?

           THOR

Promptly.

          DR. STRANGE

Great. Then I'll help you.

         THOR

If you knew where he was, why
didn't you call me?

          DR. STRANGE

I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed. Your
father said he had chosen to remain
in exile.

   (beat)

And you don't have a phone.

         THOR

No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

         STRANGE

Yeah, do you have a computer?

          THOR

No. What for?

   (beat)

Anyway, my father is no longer in
exile. So if you could tell me
where he is, I can take him home.

               Gladly.   He's in Norway.

     Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book-
     case. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.

                         STRANGE
               I'm just seeing whether this
               incantation requires any Asgardian
               modifications.

     Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.

                          STRANGE (CONT'D)
               Nope.

     Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's work
     station. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has
     magically brought it across the room as well.

                         STRANGE (CONT'D)
               Oh, we don't need that.

     Suddenly Thor is back across the room.   Books fall off the
     shelf and Thor's beer spills.

     He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.

                         THOR
               Will you stop doing that?

                         STRANGE
               I need just one strand of your
               hair.

                         THOR
               Let me explain something, my hair
               is not to be meddled wi-!

     Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair.

     Strange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a few
     gestures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly-


A20 INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM - FRONT STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS A20

     Bottom of the stairs. Strange is standing. Thor is rolling
     down the stairs. A magic portal leading into a peaceful
     meadow has opened beside Strange.

                         THOR
               We could have just walked.

             (re: the portal)
         He's waiting for you.

                      THOR
         All right.

                   STRANGE
         Don't forget your umbrella.

                      THOR
         Yes.

Thor extends his arm and holds out his hand. Crashing noises
are heard. Lots of crashing noises.

                      THOR (CONT'D)
         Sorry

Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         I suppose I'll need my brother
         back.

                   DR. STRANGE
         Yeah, right.

Suddenly we hear SCREAMING.
From above, LOKI drops out of a portal. He LANDS HARD on the
floor and then STAGGERS to his feet. On edge, confused.

                   LOKI
         ...I have been falling...for thirty
         minutes!

         You can handle him from here.

                   THOR
         Yeah of course.
             (they shake hands)
         Thank you very much for your help.

    Loki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange.

                         LOKI
               ..you think you're some kind of

               Bye-bye.

    Strange GESTURES with both hands and-

    Just like that, Thor and Loki are gone.

               Father?

    A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the
    cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below.

    It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes.
    The boys approach him quickly.

                         ODIN
               Look at this place. It's beautiful.

                         THOR
               Father, it's us.

                          ODIN
               My sons.   I've been waiting for
               you.

    Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.

               I know.    We've come to take you
               home.

               Home, yes. Your mother, she calls
               me. Do you hear it?

    Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense.

                   THOR
         Loki, lift your magic.

Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens. But Odin smiles.

                   ODIN
         Took me quite a while to break free
         from your spell. Frigga would have
         been proud.

Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor
staring at him, anger building.
Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.

                    ODIN (CONT'D)
         Come and sit with me. I don't have
         much time.

Odin sits, out of breath, weak. His sons sit beside him.

                   THOR
         I know that we failed you, but we
         can make this right.

                    ODIN
         I failed you.
             (beat)
         It is upon us...Ragnarok.

                   THOR
         No, I've stopped Ragnarok.    I put
         an end to Surtur.

                   ODIN
         No. It has already begun. She's
         coming. My life was all that held
         her back, but my time has come. I
         cannot keep her away any longer.

                   THOR
         Father, who are you talking about?

                   ODIN
         The Goddess of Death.     Hela.   My
         first born.
             (faces Thor)
         Your sister.

That hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing.

         ...what?

                    ODIN
          Her violent appetites grew beyond
          my control. I couldn't stop her,
          so I imprisoned her. Locked her
          away. She draws her strength from
          Asgard...and once she gets there,
          her powers will be limitless.

                    THOR
          Whatever she is, we can stop her.
          We can face her together.

                    ODIN
              (takes Thor's hand)
          No we won't. I'm on a different
          path now. This you must face
          alone.

Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe.

                    ODIN (CONT'D)
          I love you my sons.

For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet
moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.

          Look at that.

Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.

                    ODIN (CONT'D)
          Remember this place. Home.

A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that-
-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST. THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED.
A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin.
The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP.
Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with
rage. Loki takes a step back.

Thor faces Loki. Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.

CRACK! Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN!

Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian
armor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well.
A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of
the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA.
Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings. Then:

                    HELA
         So he's gone?

         That's a shame. I would've liked

A tense moment as they stare each other down.

                   THOR
         You must be Hela.   I'm Thor, son of
         Odin.

                   HELA
         Really, you don't look like him.

                   LOKI
         Perhaps we can reach an
         arrangement.

                   HELA
         You sound like him.

Loki shifts nervously. Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.

                   HELA (CONT'D)
         Kneel.

                   LOKI
         Beg your pardon?

Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.

                   HELA
         Kneel...before your Queen.

                   THOR
         I don't think so.

Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela...
- THUD - the mighty hammer comes to a cold stop, against
Hela's hand.
Thor is shocked. He stretches out his hands, trying to call
Mjolnir back to him.

                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  25.



    The hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o-
    war. But ultimately Hela keeps possession.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               It's not possible.

                         HELA
               Darling, you have no idea what's
               possible.

    HELA SHATTERS THOR'S HAMMER.

    The blast of Mjolnir's destruction sends a wave of energy
    through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the
    impact.

    Thor is stupefied. In shock. He looks up to see Hela is
    running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying
    battle headdress.

    Loki's reaction is more panic.   He stands and calls up:

                         LOKI
               Bring us back!

                         THOR
               No!!

    Hela CHARGES Thor and Loki as-

    -WHOOSH!   The Bi-Frost envelopes all of them.


22 INT. BI-FROST - CONTINUOUS 22

    Thor and Loki ZOOM UPWARDS, held inside this celestial beam
    warping them towards Asgard. Loki and Thor look down to
    see... Hela is in the Bi-Frost, behind them and CATCHING UP.

    Loki turns and throws TWO DAGGERS at her. They find their
    mark, stalling her for a second. But she PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH
    Loki, KNOCKING HIM OUT OF THE BI-FROST. Gone in an instant.

                         THOR
               Loki!

    Hela projects a jet black grappling hook and GRABS HOLD of
    Thor. Drawing him to her, preparing to finish him off. Thor
    pulls up his legs, and KICKS Hela with both feet. This
    effectively dislodges him from her grasp but also...

    ...KNOCKS THOR OUT OF THE BI-FROST! Now both he and Loki are
    gone. If they aren't dead, then God knows where they went.

23 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS 23

    VOLSTAGG has a grip on Heimdall's sword, manning Bi-Frost's
    controls. Behind him FANDRAL is overseeing Skurge, who is
    mopping up the dragon guts.

    BOOM! Hela emerges with thunderous impact. Fandral and
    Volstagg draw their weapons, preparing to engage.

                         VOLSTAGG
              Who are you!? What have you done
              with Thor?

    Hela fires TWO BLACK DAGGERS, each one dropping its target to
    the ground. Hela then walks forward and-

                          HELA
              I'm Hela.

    -BRUTALLY KILLS FANDRAL AND VOLSTAGG!

    Hela sees Skurge. Approaches calmly, a vision of death.

    With Hela only a few feet from him, Skurge cowers.   Pause.

                        SKURGE
              I'm just a janitor.

    Skurge ever-so-slightly peers up at her.

                        HELA
              You look like a smart boy with good
              survival instincts. How would you
              like a job?

    Hela looks out upon Asgard as Skurge rises behind her.


24 EXT. ASGARD - THE MOUNTAINS - SAME 24

    A mysterious HOODED FIGURE watches Hela's arrival at the
    Observatory and begins a steady descent towards the city.


25 EXT. SAKAAR - THE WASTELAND SHORE - DAY 25

    SUPER WIDE: A sky full of WORMHOLES. Thor, only a spec at
    this distance, SHOOTS out of one of these wormholes. He HITS
    the surface, causing a CLOUD of dust.

    Find Thor on his back surrounded by strange colorful space
    wreckage. Looking up, Thor sees a large metal object falling
    from a different wormhole! He rolls out of the way. THUD!
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    27.


Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris.
Thor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking
down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy
dune littered with SPACE JUNK.
Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a
giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms.
A loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR
""SCRAPPER"" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the
water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked
humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.
A Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew.

                   LEAD SCRAPPER
         Are you a fighter or are you food?

                   THOR
         I'm just passing through.

                   LEAD SCRAPPER
         It is food. On your knees.

Thor reaches out to summon Mjolnir. A reflex. Nothing.
The LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A
solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More
Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles.
Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest
of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs.
WHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It's cool,
sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is
also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.
The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down
to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to
a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful
and ruthless asskicker.
S142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She
finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship.

                      SCRAPPER #142
         He's MINE.

She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and
FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED.
The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away.

                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 28.



                      SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D)
         Wait!

S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on
to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor
continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets.

                   SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D)
         Wait! He's mine. So if you want
         him, you go through me.

The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons.

                   SCRAPPER
         But we've already got him.

S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate.

                   SCRAPPER #142
         Alright then I guess I go through
         you.

                      LEAD SCRAPPER
         More food.

She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery...
...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear
a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE.
She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire
lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the
ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than
tiny pieces of litter covering the beach.
Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One
final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually
GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.

                      THOR
         Thank you.

From her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES
into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she
threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD.
She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc
blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand
screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned.
S142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship.

30 INT. WARSONG SHIP - DAY 30

    Thor's face SMUSHED up against glass.   His eyes are open.

    Thor's POV - THE CAPITAL - an eclectic city composed of
    salvaged items from all over the universe.

    Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath
    Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S142 piloting the ship.

    Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device
    she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him.

                        SCRAPPER #142
              This is Scrapper 142. I need
              clearance and an audience with the
              boss. I've got something special.

                         THOR
              Hey!   Where are you taking me?

    S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then
    nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of
              Odin. I need to get back to
              Asgard.

                        SCRAPPER #142
              Many apologies, your majesty.

    S142 ZAPS him and guides her ship towards a COLOSSAL TOWER.


26 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - DAY 26

    CLOSE ON: Hela, headdress retracted, hair down, her beautiful
    face fully visible. We do not see who she is talking to.

                        HELA
              It's come to my attention that you
              don't know who I am.

    REVEAL THE ARMIES OF ASGARD FACING DOWN HELA.

    Standing in front is HOGUN, sword and shield out.

                        HELA (CONT'D)
              I am Hela, Odin's first born,
              Commander of the legions of Asgard,
              the rightful heir to the throne,
              and the Goddess of Death.

                        HELA (CONT'D)
              My father is dead. As are the
              princes. You're welcome.
                  (then:)
              We were once the seat of absolute
              power in the Cosmos. Our supremacy
              was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped
              at Nine Realms. Our destiny is to
              rule over all others. And I am
              here to restore that power. Kneel
              before me...and rise into the ranks
              of my great conquest.

    THE E-GUARDS GET INTO ATTACK FORMATION.

                        HOGUN
              Whoever you are... whatever you've
              done, surrender now! Or we will
              show you know mercy.

                        HELA
              Whoever I am? Did you listen to a
              word I said?

                        HOGUN
              This is your last warning!

                        HELA
              I thought you'd be happy to see me.

    Hela forms her headdress.

                        HELA (CONT'D)
              Fine.

    The Asgardian archers LOOSE DOZENS OF ARROWS, but-

    -Hela advances confidently, DESTROYS the SHIPS and SOARS INTO
    THE EINHERJAR! In a symphony of spectacular terror, Hela
    proceeds to DECIMATE the entire regiment. A tornado of
    carnage, a legendary massacre.


27 EXT. BELOW THE RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME 27

    While Hela slaughters up above, we tilt up from a boat,
    moored at the base of the Observatory, to see the mysterious
    figure from earlier is now SCALING the rocks towards the top.


28 INT. THE OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS 28

    Now silhouetted in the entrance way, the figure scans the
    Observatory. His gaze falls on-
                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   31.



     -Bi-Frost's controls. Specifically Heimdall's sword.


29 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - CONTINUOUS 29

     It's eerily quiet. CLOSE on Hela scanning the battlefield.
     100+ slain Einherjar at her feet.

     ANGLE on Skurge as he steps forward - awe, admiration, fear.

                         HELA
               Oh, I've missed this. Still, it's
               a shame. Good soldiers dying for
               nothing...all because they couldn't
               see the future. Sad.
                   (then she sees:)
               Oh! Look, still alive.

     Reveal Hogun, severely injured but staggering to his feet,
     resilient.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               Change of heart?

     Hogun draws a dagger as a last ditch attack.

                         HOGUN
               Go back to whatever cave you crept
               out of you evil demoness!

     Hela IMPALES Hogun on a spike.   She turns to Skurge.

                         HELA
               Let's go see my palace.

     Skurge stares at Hogun before following Hela towards the
     palace.

A32 INT. DARK TUNNEL - DAY A32

     THOR, strapped to the chair, suddenly finds himself slowly
     moving forward. After a beat-

     -the walls LIGHT UP and a SOOTHING VOICE speaks to him.

                         SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
               Fear not, for you are found. You
               are home, and there is no going
               back. No one leaves this place.

     Thor STRUGGLES against his restraints.

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
         But what is this place? The answer
         in Sakaar.

The tunnel walls show images of Sakaar's place in the Cosmos.

                   SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
         Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
         Sakaar lives on the edge of the
         known and unknown.

Images of the wormholes that cover Sakaar's atmosphere.

                   SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
         It is the collection point for all
         lost and unloved things. Like you.
         But here on Sakaar, you are
         significant. You are valuable.
         Here, you are loved.

         What...the hell?

                   SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
         He is the original. The first
         lost, and the first found. The
         creator of Sakaar and the father of
         the Contest of Champions.

Images of the arena where aliens battle to the death.

         Where once you were nothing, now
         you are something. You are the

             (then:)
         Congratulations! You will meet the

Images around the tunnel begin speeding up. Chaos, violence,
and confusion mixed in with Grandmaster's face.
Thor, already bewildered, looks on the verge of panic.

                   SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
         Prepare yourself. Prepare
         yourself. You are now meeting the

    Thor SCREAMS!


32 INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 32

    Suddenly Thor is somewhere else, surrounded weirdos and
    insanely dressed palace guards.

    His scream dies down self-consciously.

    A musical beat PLAYS in the background.

    THE GRANDMASTER, a tall mysterious man in golden robes. He is
    looking right at us. He doesn't know what to make of us. He's
    curious, thrilled, revolted, and titillated.

    Pulling back we see TOPAZ, his trusty guard, at his side. Two
    GOLDEN LADIES loiter off to the side. Other strange guests
    can be seen in the background. Grandmaster just stares.

    S142 stands beside Grandmaster.    Finally:

                        GRANDMASTER
              He's wonderful.
                  (then:)
              It is a he?

    Reveal S142 standing beside Thor.

                           SCRAPPER #142
              It's a he.

                        GRANDMASTER
              Yeah. I love when you come to visit
              142, you bring me the best stuff.
                  (to Topaz:)
              Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
              about Scrapper 142...what do I
              always say? ""She is the..."" and it
              starts with a B.

              Trash.

                        GRANDMASTER
              No, not trash. Were you waiting
              just to call her that? It doesn't
              start with a ""B.""

                           TOPAZ
              Booze hag.

                   GRANDMASTER
         I'm so sorry. No, ""best."" I was
         thinking about ""best.""
             (to S142:)
         Because I always say you're the
         best. She brought me my precious
         beloved Champion, you know.

                   TOPAZ
         You say that every time she's here.

                   GRANDMASTER
         What have you brought today?    Tell
         me.

                   SCRAPPER #142
         A contender.

                    THOR
         A what?

                   GRANDMASTER
         I need to go closer. I want a
         closer look at this. Can you take
         us closer? Thank you.

Grandmaster advances on Thor. Examining him closely and
strangely. Then:

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         Pay this lady.

                   THOR
         Just wait a damn minute.    I'm not
         for sale.

Using all his might, Thor breaks out of his shackles, but-
-S142 ZAPS him again. Paralyzed by superheated veins.

                    GRANDMASTER
         Man.   He is a fighter.

                   SCRAPPER #142
         I'd take 10 million.

                   TOPAZ
         Tell her she's dreaming.

                   GRANDMASTER
         For heaven's sake, transfer the
         units.
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   35.


Topaz transfers S142 the units. Without sympathy or ceremony,
S142 exits.

                   THOR
         You'll pay for this!

                   SCRAPPER #142
         No, I got paid for this.

Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT.
He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is
causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go.
Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a
wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster
around as he speaks.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Here's what I wanna know.    Who are
         you?

                   THOR
         I am the God of THUNDER!!!

Thor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit of
static electricity POPS within Thor's hands.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Wow. I didn't hear any thunder,
         but out of your fingers, was that
         like...sparkles?

                   TOPAZ
         We located your cousin.

                    GRANDMASTER
         Oh good!
             (to Thor:)
         Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna
         like this.

Grandmaster moves Thor's chair to another section where-
-COUSIN CARLO is waiting. He's strapped to a chair like
Thor, and he is terrified.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         There he is. Hey, cuz. We almost
         couldn't find you. What, have you
         been hiding?

Cousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear.

                      THOR
         Hi.

Carlo only further weeps.

                      GRANDMASTER
         So...

                    COUSIN CARLO
         Please.   I'm sorry.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Carlo... I pardon you.

                      COUSIN CARLO
         Thank you.     Thank you.

                   GRANDMASTER
         You're officially pardoned...from
         life.

Grandmaster casually takes Topaz's Sakaarian Guard staff and
JABS it into his cousin's mid-section-
-CAUSING ALL OF HIS FLESH TO MELT OFF HIS SKELETON!
Carlo SHRIEKS IN PAIN before his vocal cords melt. Thor
looks on, in shock.

                   THOR
         Oh, my god!

Liquid Carlo spreads towards Grandmaster.

                   GRANDMASTER
         I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping
         in it. Look out!

                   THOR
             (repulsed)
         Oh, the smell.

                   GRANDMASTER
         What does it smell like?

                   TOPAZ
         Burnt toast.

                   GRANDMASTER
         What happened to my manners? I
         haven't properly introduced myself.
         Come on. Follow me.

Grandmaster gives Topaz back her staff.

                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  37.


Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF
MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music
thus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor.
Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption,
riffing a melody over the existing music.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         My name is Grandmaster. I preside
         over a little harlequinade called
         the Contest of Champions. People
         come from far and wide to
         unwillingly participate in it. And
         you, my friend, might just be part
         of the new cast. What do you say
         to that?

                   THOR
         We're not friends, and I don't give
         a shit about your games! I'm going
         back to Asgard!

                   GRANDMASTER
             (amused)
         Ass-gard?
             (then:)
         One, two, three, four.

Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster's
guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC.
Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle
unfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on one
particular group of VIPS, specifically...
...LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.

                   LOKI
         There was a wormhole in space and
         time beneath me. At that moment, I
         let go.

                   THOR
         Loki!? Loki! Over here!

Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so as
to speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.

                   LOKI
         Excuse me one second.

                   THOR
         Loki!
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16     38.


Loki hustles over to Thor, SHUSHING him.

                    LOKI
         What?   You're alive?

                   THOR
         Yes, of course I'm alive.

                   LOKI
         What are you doing here?

                   THOR
         What do you mean, what am I doing?
         I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
         Where's your chair?

                   LOKI
         I didn't get a chair.

                   THOR
         Get me out of this one.

                      LOKI
         I can't.

                      THOR
         What?

                   LOKI
         I've made friends with this man.
         He's called the Grandmaster.

                   THOR
         Oh, he's crazy!

                   LOKI
         I've gained his favor.. The Bi-
         Frost brought me out here weeks
         ago.

                      THOR
         Weeks ago?     I just got here.

Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.

                   GRANDMASTER
         What are you whispering about?

Both Thor and Loki react, startled.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         Time works real different around
         these parts.

         On any other world, I'd be like,
         millions of years old. But here on
         Sakaar...

Grandmaster beholds himself. Then turns to Loki. A truly
uncomfortable silence.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         In any case, you know this... You
         call yourself Lord of Thunder?

                   THOR
         God of Thunder.    Tell him.

                   LOKI
         I've never met this man in my life.

                   THOR
         He's my brother.

                    LOKI
         Adopted.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Is he any kind of a fighter?

Loki shrugs, gives the universal gesture for ""so-so.""

                   THOR
         You take this thing out of my neck
         and I'll show you.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Now listen to that. He's
         threatening me. Hey, Sparkles,
         here's the deal. If you wanna get
         back to Ass-place, Assberg...

                    THOR
         Asgard.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Any contender who defeats my
         champion, their freedom they shall
         win.

                   THOR
         Fine. Then point me in the
         direction of whoever's ass I have
         to kick.

                   GRANDMASTER
         That's what I call, contender!
         Direction would be this way, Lord.

                           THOR

    Guards arrive.    They haul Thor up and escort him out.

33 OMITTED 33
34 INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT 34

    Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien
    prisoners are lurking in the back.

    The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and
    immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The
    door doesn't budge, not even a little.

    Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.

                        KORG
              Hey! Take it easy man!
                  (Thor looks back)
              Over here. The pile of rocks
              waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a
              thing, I'm a being. Allow me to
              introduce myself, my name is Korg.
              I'm kind of like the leader in
              here. I'm made of rocks, as you
              can see, but don't let that
              intimidate you. You don't need to
              be afraid unless you're made of
              scissors.
                  (GIGGLES to himself)
              Just a little rock-paper-scissor
              joke for you. This is my very good
              friend over here, Miek. He's an
              insect and has knives for hands.

    MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by
    doing some karate moves.

                        THOR
              You're a Kronan, aren't you?

                           KORG
              That I am.

                        THOR
              How'd you end up in here?

                        KORG
              Well, I tried to start a revolution
              but didn't print enough pamphlets,
              so hardly anyone turned up.

         Except for my mom and her
         boyfriiend, who I hate. As
         punishment, I was forced to be in
         here and become a gladiator. Bit
         of a promotional disaster.
             (secretive)
         But I'm actually organizing another
         revolution. I don't know if you'd
         be interested in something like
         that. Do you reckon you'd be
         interested?

Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around
behind Korg.

                   THOR
         How did you...

                   KORG
         Yeah, no. This whole thing is a
         circle. But not a real circle,
         more like a freaky circle.

                   THOR
         This doesn't make any sense.

                   KORG
         No, nothing makes sense here. The
         only thing that does make sense, is
         that nothing makes sense.

                   THOR
         Has anyone here fought the
         Grandmaster's Champion?

                   KORG
         Doug has. Doug!
             (realizes)
         Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's
         right. Everyone who fights the

         What about you? You're made of
         rocks.

         Perishable rocks.
             (a pebble FALLS OFF)
         There you go. Another one gone.
         Yeah, no, I just do the smaller
         fights, warm up the crowd and
         whatnot. Wait. You're not gonna
         face him, are you?

                 That's exactly what Doug used to
                 say. See you later, new Doug.

     Korg walks away and approaches Miek.


A35 EXT. ASGARD - STREETS - SUNSET A35

     The streets of Asgard are cold and silent, save for the
     occasional distant sounds and screams of a city under siege.

A36 INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS A36

     Moving down the throne room corridor we see-

     -SEVERAL DEAD EINHERJAR GUARDS.

     One guy is still alive, desperately trying to crawl away.

     SHLNK!    A black blade finishes him off.

     Reveal HELA and SKURGE looking down at the carnage.

     Hela directs her attention to FRESCOS ON THE CEILING. Like
     the Sistine Chapel, except these depict Asgard's shining
     influence on the Nine Realms. Bountiful harvests, shepherds
     with full flocks, common folk throwing parades for Asgard's
     army, etc.

                           HELA
                 Does no one remember me?
                     (awaiting an answer)
                 Has no one been taught our history?
                 Look at these lies. Goblets and
                 garden parties? Peace treaties?

     Hela leads them towards the throne.

                 Odin... proud to have it... ashamed
                 of how he got it.

     Hela FIRES SPIKES into the ceiling, RIPPING DOWN plaster.

     Beneath the surface are older Frescos.      These ones are far
     more dark and sinister.

     Soldiers in battle. Blood. A giant war wolf.     Young Odin
     and young Hela. Slaves building the palace.

     Skurge is at least somewhat disturbed by this.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
               We were unstoppable. I was his
               weapon in the conquest that built
               Asgard's empire. One by one, the
               realms became ours.

     Hela turns from the murals to address Skurge.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               But then, simply because my
               ambition outgrew his...he banished
               me, caged me, locked me away like
               an animal. Before that, Asgard's
               warriors were honored, their bodies
               buried as heroes beneath this very
               place.

     Hela beckons Skurge to follow her.


B36 INT. ODIN'S VAULT - CONTINUOUS B36

     Hela enters the vault and descends the stairs towards the
     magical items.

                         SKURGE
               Odin's treasures.

     SKURGE follows her. Hela walks towards the Infinity Gauntlet.

               Fake.

     Hela KNOCKS the gauntlet off its pedestal.

               Most of the stuff in here is fake.

               Or weak.

     Next: Surtur's skull.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               Smaller than I thought it would be.

     Next: The Tesseract.    She hesitates:

                   (notices:)
               But this... The Eternal Flame.

     THE ETERNAL FLAME flickers in its chalice.

     Hela DIGS HER HAND INTO THE ETERNAL FLAME. She pulls her
     hand out now cupping GREEN FIRE, like a torch.

     Hela approaches a large circular RUNE ETCHING on the floor.

     Hela manifests a huge CLAW HAMMER. She SMASHES THROUGH THE
     RUNES ON THE FLOOR, creating a gaping chasm.

     She looks at Skurge.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               Want to see what true power looks
               like?

C36 INT. HIDDEN ASGARDIAN CATACOMBS - DAY C36

     Hela LANDS like a bad ass.

     Dust settles. The light of Hela's hand torch reveals a stone
     crypt. An ornate burial place for the heroes of Old Asgard.

     We can see countless rotted skeletons in badass ancient
     Asgardian armor. Hela's regiment.

     Among them, A MASSIVE WOLF'S SKELETON. TERRIFYING AND
     MONSTROUS, COLOSSAL CHAINS AROUND THE BONES OF ITS PAWS.

               Fenris. My darling, what have they
               done to you?

     She lifts her flaming hand above her head. She slams her hand
     into the ground.

               With the Eternal Flame, you are
               reborn!

     The fire spreads out, covering Fenris and Hela's old army.

      As the fire covers the skeletons, they SHUDDER TO LIFE.

                           HELA (CONT'D)
                 I've missed you. I've missed you
                 all.

      HELA'S BUTCHERS, rise up before their commander.

      ABOVE:   Skurge looks down, worried.

      BELOW: A sinister light returns to Fenris's eyes as he
      stands proudly before his master, allowing her to pet the fur
      of his terrifying face.


C36A INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT C36A

      Thor sits against the wall.   Quietly praying.

                           THOR
                 Odin, I bid you take your place in
                 the halls of Valhalla...
                     (then:)
                 Where the brave shall live forever.
                 Nor shall we mourn but rejoice-

              THOR (CONT'D)                     LOKI (O.S.)
      -for those that have died the    -for those that have died the
      glorious death.                  glorious death.

      Reveal Loki standing across the cell.   Thor gives him a hard
      look.

                           LOKI (CONT'D)
                 It hurts, doesn't it? Being lied
                 to. Being told you're one thing and
                 then learning it's all a fiction.

      Thor picks up some stones that have fallen from Korg's leg
      and casually starts throwing them through Loki's illusion.

                           LOKI (CONT'D)
                 You didn't think I'd really come
                 and see you, did you? This place
                 is disgusting.

      Thor throws another stone through Loki.

                           LOKI (CONT'D)
                 Does this mean you don't want my
                 help?

      Thor throws another stone through Loki.
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    46.



                   LOKI (CONT'D)
         Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
         position with Grandmaster, it took
         me time to win his trust. He's a
         lunatic, but he can be amenable.

Thor throws another stone through Loki. Disinterested.

                   LOKI (CONT'D)
         What I'm telling you is, you could
         join me at the Grandmaster's side.
         Perhaps, in time, an accident
         befalls the Grandmaster, and
         then...

Loki gestures: ""we take over.""
Thor throws another stone through Loki. Bored.

                   LOKI (CONT'D)
         You're not seriously thinking of
         going back, are you? Our sister
         destroyed your hammer like a piece
         of glass. She's stronger than both
         of us. She's stronger than you.
         You don't stand a chance. Do you
         understand what I'm saying to you?

Thor just scowls.

                   LOKI (CONT'D)
         Fine. I guess I'll just have to go
         it alone. Like I've always done.
             (Thor smirks)
         Would you say something?

Now out of stones, Thor looks around the floor for more.

                   LOKI (CONT'D)
         Say something!

Thor finally looks right at Loki, speaks fast and curt:

                   THOR
         What would you like me to say? You
         faked your own death, you stole the
         throne, stripped Odin of his power,
         stranded him on Earth...
             (on Loki:)
         -to die, releasing the Goddess of
         Death.
             (back to Thor:)

                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 47.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Have I said enough, or do you do
              you want me to go further back than
              the past two days?

    Loki's eyes burn.   Thor stares coldly at him.   Loki tries to
    compose himself.

                        LOKI
              You know, I haven't seen this
              Beloved Champion he talks of, but
              I've heard he's astonishingly
              savage. I've placed a large wager
              against you tomorrow. Don't let me
              down.

    Loki SHIMMERS, and his illusion vanishes.   Korg runs in to
    try to kick him.

                        KORG
              Piss off, ghost!
                  (then:)
              He's freaking gone.


40 INT. THE ARENA - RECEIVING AREA 40

    Thor, Korg, and a gaggle of other prisoners/fighters have
    been led from their cells to a PRE-FIGHT HOLDING AREA.

    Korg and Thor are by the weapons rack.

                        KORG
              Yuck! There's Still someone's hair
              and blood all over this. Guys, can
              you clean up the weapons once you
              finish your fight? Disgusting
              slobs.
                  (then:)
              Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork?

                         THOR
              No.

                        KORG
              Yeah, not really useful unless
              you're fighting off three vampires
              that were huddled together.

                        THOR
              I really wish I had my hammer.

                         KORG
              Hammer?
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                48.



                   THOR
         Quite unique. It was made from
         this special metal from the heart
         of a dying star. And when I spun
         it really, really fast it gave me
         the ability to fly.

                   KORG
         You rode a hammer?

                   THOR
         No, I didn't ride the hammer.

                   KORG
         The hammer rode you on your back?

                   THOR
         No. I used to spin it really fast,
         and it would pull me off the...

                      KORG
         Oh my God.     The hammer pulled you
         off?

                   THOR
         The ground. It would pull me off
         the ground, up into the air, and I
         would fly. Every time I threw it,
         it would always come back to me.

                    KORG
         Sounds like you had a pretty
         special and intimate relationship
         wiht this hammer and that losing it
         was almost comparable to losing a
         loved one.

                   THOR
         That's a nice way of putting it.

Thor spots S142 dealing at the bar. He's once again eyeing
the fob device clipped to her belt. Scowls.

                   SCRAPPER #142
         I said they're mine.

                   THOR
         See her, the one that put me in
         here.

                   KORG
         Yeah, Scrapper 142. She's strong.
         And she drinks a lot.

                   KORG (CONT'D)
         Gotta watch out for those
         Asgardians, man. They are hard to
         perish.

                       THOR
         Asgardian?

Thor breaks away from the line and runs to S142.

                       THOR (CONT'D)
         Hey!   Hey!

S142 holds up the fob.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Do not zap me with that thing. I
         just wanna talk. Asgard is in
         danger.

Thor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, on
her forearms. It's a moment of recognition and disbelief.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used
         to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was
         younger...until I found out that
         you were all women. There's
         nothing wrong with women, of
         course. I love women. Sometimes a
         little too much. Not in a creepy
         way, just more of a respectful
         appreciation. I think it's great
         that there is an elite force of
         women warriors. It's about time.

                   SCRAPPER #142
         Are you done?

                   WARDEN (O.S.)
         Lord of Thunder, you're up.

                   THOR
         Please, help me.     I need your help.

                       SCRAPPER #142
         Bye.

                   THOR
         Fine, then you must be a traitor or
         a coward because the Valkyrie are
         sworn to protect the throne.

S142 finally turns her attention to Thor, intense.

                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 50.



                         SCRAPPER #142
               Listen closely, your majesty. This
               is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I'm a
               scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

     Guards swarm Thor, dragging him back

                         WARDEN (O.S.)
               Bring him in for processing!

                         VALKYRIE
               And no one escapes this place. So
               you're gonna die anyway.

     Despite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve. And from
     now on we will refer to Scrapper #142 as VALKYRIE.

     Valkyrie takes her booze and walks away. Thor is dragged
     away, passing Korg and the other prisoners.


40A INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY 40A

     Thor is strapped to a chair. Reveal a weird alien BARBER
     (Stan Lee cameo) holding up some rusty shears.

                         STAN LEE
               Now, don't you move. My hands
               ain't as steady as they used to be.

                         THOR
               By Odin's beard, you shall not cut
               my hair... lest you feel the wrath
               of the might Thor.

     Barber activates a menacing CUTTING TOOL.   Thor freaks out.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Please. Please, kind sir, do not
               cut my hair! No!


40B INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT 40B

     Hundreds of thousands of spectators packed into the stadium
     seats. Dozens of starships are parked above the arena.

     Find THE GRANDMASTER'S LUXURY SUITE, a VIP box attached to
     the fighting area. The Golden Ladies are in attendance.

     Loki lounges in the suite, taking wagers on the fight card.

     Grandmaster walks out into the center of the arena.   Suddenly-
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   51.


-THE GRANDMASTER GROWS TO 60-FEET TALL! This enlarged
projection of Grandmaster addresses the audience.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Wow! Look at all of you. What a
         show, WHAT-A-NIGHT! Who's having
         fun? Please, I'm your host. Big
         round of applause for all of our
         undercard competitors... who died
         so gruesomely. Good sports. What a
         show! What a night! This is what
         you've come for and so have I.
             (applause)
         And now, without further ado...
         it's main event time!!
             (INSANE APPLAUSE)
         Making his first appearance, though
         he looks quite promising, got a
         couple of tricks up his sleeve.
         I'll say no more, see what you
         think. Ladies and gentlemen...
             (LAUGHTER from the crowd)
         I give to you...Lord of Thunder!

Enter Thor. Gladiator Thor. Shaved head, trimmed beard,
minimalist armor, covered in weapons. Two swords on his
back, giant mace in one hand, spiked shield in the other.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         Watch out for his fingers. They
         make sparks.

Thor looks up at the throngs of SCREAMING FANS. And then...
...puts on his helmet. A badass gladiator variation of his
classic winged helm. Thor is ready to rumble.
ABOVE: Find Valkyrie in her Warsong ship, parked amongst the
other tailgaters. She POPS open a bottle of booze. Drinks.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         Okay, this is it. Let's get ready
         to welcome this guy. Here he comes.
         He is a creature. What can we say
         about him? Well, he's unique.
         There's none like him. I feel a
         special connection with him.

Suddenly the floor beneath Thor's feet LOWERS. A slow,
tension-building GRIND as he sees-
-A DOOR across the arena. Bigger and bigger.

                      BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 52.


The entire crowd is on its feet. Palpable anticipation. The
spotlights change to bright stadium lights.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          He's undefeated. HE'S THE
          REIGNING...HE'S THE DEFENDING...
          Ladies and gentlemen... I give
          you...

KA-BOOM! EXPLODING through a door is the Champion...
...THE INCREDIBLE HULK! He wears an armored shoulder guard
and a Spartan helmet. He carries a warhammer in one hand and
a battleaxe in the other. Hulk POUNDS his chest and ROARS,
further energizing an already frenzied crowd.
Meanwhile, the sight of Hulk makes Thor's arms drop to his
sides along with his jaw dropping to the ground. And then-
-Thor LAUGHS his ass off. Like, ""that's my buddy over there!""

                    THOR
          Yes!

IN THE VIP BOX: Loki goes ghost white. Traumatic memories of
being Hulk-smashed flood his brain. Gone is all his joy.

                    LOKI
          I have to get off this planet.

Loki tries to exit, but the Grandmaster stops him.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?

Grandmaster plops Loki down in the front row, right against
the glass. Loki casually tries to hide his face in his hand.
IN THE ARENA:

                    THOR
          Hey! We know each other. He's a
          friend from work.
              (to Hulk:)
          Where have you been? Everybody
          thought you were dead. So much has
          happened since I last saw you. I
          lost my hammer. Like, yesterday,
          so that's still pretty fresh.
              (then:)
          Loki! Loki's alive. Can you
          believe it? He's up there.
              (waves to Loki:)
          Loki! Look who it is!
                        BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              53.


Loki is petrified.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Banner, I never thought I would say
         this, but I'm happy to see you.

IN THE ARENA: Hulk is still eyeballing Thor while the
capacity crowd CHANTS insanely for ""HULK! HULK! HULK!""

                     THOR (CONT'D)
         Banner.    Hey, Banner!

Hulk's face grimaces and contorts, suppressing puny Banner.

                      HULK
         NO BANNER!     ONLY HULK!

Hulk CHARGES at Thor. Insanely fast.

                   THOR
         What are you doing?    It's me.

Thor DODGES the first few attacks, but then Hulk SHATTERS his
shield and sends Thor FLYING.
Thor draws a sword and STABS it into the ground to slow his
momentum. Draws the other sword and faces off against Hulk.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Banner, we're friends. This is
         crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

They engage again. Hulk KICKS Thor, sending him SLAMMING
into the wall.

                   GRANDMASTER
         Here we go.

Thor jumps down just in time to avoid Hulk's warhammer, which
HITS so hard that it remains lodged in the wall.
With Hulk charging again, Thor RIPS the warhammer out of the
wall and WALLOPS Hulk with it.
Hulk goes CRASHING alongside the arena. He ends up sprawled
out in a pile of rubble, slightly dazed.

                      GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         What?

ABOVE: Val is watching through a set of high-tech
binoculars. She reacts to Thor, reluctantly impressed.

                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   54.


Thor advances on Hulk with all the swagger. He takes off his
helmet and CALLS OUT to Hulk, provoking him.

                   THOR
         Hey, big guy. The sun's getting
         real low.

Hulk takes off his helmet. Scowling. Teeth GRINDING.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         That's it. The sun's going down.
         I won't hurt you anymore. No one
         will.

WHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has
Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor.
Over and over and over again.
IN THE VIP BOX: Loki's whole mood shifts. The joy returns to
his face, like ""everything will be alright!"" Loki LAUGHS.

                   LOKI
         Yes! That's how it feels!
             (to Grandmaster:)
         I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first.
Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe.

                   THOR
         All right. Screw it.

CLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are
fighting warhammer versus battleaxe...
...and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these
exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor
continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while
evading all of Hulk's best attacks.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         I know you're in there, Banner.
         I'll get you out!

One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS
Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the
chest, KNOCKING him to the ground.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         What's the matter with you? You're
         embarrassing me! I told them we
         were friends!

GROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab
that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena. Hulk immediately
LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor!
Hulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena,
just PUMMELING him with punches. Left-right-left-right.
Thor's head snaps back and forth.
In the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN. Then-
-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY. Like an instinctual
defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A
BURST OF LIGHTNING!
Seething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then
BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH! Hulk is LAUNCHED
BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD.

                   CROWD
         Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

                   KORG
         Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

The crowd gets hushed. They've never seen this before.
IN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed. Loki is amazed.
Hulk and Thor stagger to their feet. Thor looks at himself,
a little surprised. There are still small charges of
lightning CRACKLING through his veins.
Meanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they're at it again,
close-quarters boxing. Thor is winning the exchanges,
landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk's body. And then suddenly-
-BZZZ! The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob!
Thor drops, totally caught off guard!
Hulk plants his feet and JUMPS! He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out
of the arena, up-up-up into the sky! At the apex of his jump
Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent.
Val sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like
""This fight is over, time to beat traffic.""

                   KORG (CONT'D)
         Another day, another Doug.

Down below, Thor groggily turns over. He does so just in
time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb!
No time to avoid it. KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor's
eyes go lightning white. Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor.

    The impact knocks Thor unconscious and we CUT TO BLACK.

36 INT. THRONE ROOM - SUNSET 36

    Hela sits on the throne trying to get comfortable, headdress
    & cowl off. Skurge stands at the foot of the throne.

                        HELA
              What is that noise?

                        SKURGE
              The common folk aren't exactly
              falling in line. There's a
              resistance trying to knock down the
              front gates.

    Hela sends her BUTCHER TROOPS to deal with it.

                        HELA
              Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

                        SKURGE
              Well, me dad was a stonemason, me
              mum was-

              I'll just stop you there. What I
              meant was what is your ambition?

                        SKURGE
              I just want a chance to prove
              myself.

                         HELA
              Recognition.
                  (then:)
              When I was young every great King
              had an executioner. Not just to
              execute people, but also to execute
              their vision. But mainly to
              execute people. Still a great
              honor.
                  (beat)
              I was Odin's executioner.

    Hela holds out her hand and uses her powers to FORM A DOUBLE-
    SIDED OBSIDIAN AXE, which she offers to Skurge.

                        HELA (CONT'D)
              And you will be my executioner.

                Skurge, where's the sword?

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                That sword is the key to opening
                the Bi-Frost.

      SPLASH! Boots running across the shallow water. We meet a
      family of refugees from the city. FATHER, MOTHER, SON (14),
      and young daughter (8). They're RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.

      Hot on their heels are a pair of Hela's sinister Butchers,
      hunting like a pack of wolves.

      After scrambling through a grove of trees the family make
      their way through a narrow pass. The Butchers are hot on
      their heels, their growls getting louder behind them when -
      BAM! The son runs right into a tall, immovable object...

     HEIMDALL! No regal armor, no golden helm. This Heimdall has a

     arrive, desperation.

                            HEIMDALL
               Excuse me.

     In one swift motion Heimdall draws the BI-FROST SWORD, steps
     forward and SLASHES through the Butchers, ending them.

     He then turns to the family, gestures for them to follow him.

                         HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
               Sorry about that. These bloody
               things are everywhere. Come on.

48 EXT. ASGARD - MOUNTAIN RAVINE - DAY 48

     Heimdall approaches the steep face of the mountain. Carved
     into the rock is YGGDRASIL, the world tree. Heimdall kneels,
     whispers a few words under his breath, and... A HUGE SECTION
     OF THE MOUNTAIN FACE VANISHES IN A SHIMMERING ILLUSION!


49 INT. STRONGHOLD - DAY 49

     It's busy with activity - hundreds of Asgardians who fled the
     city after Hela's invasion are living here. Men, women, and
     children. Strong and weak, young and old.

     Heimdall turns to the family, even manages a smile.

                         HEIMDALL
               You'll be safe here.

     They enter the stronghold.    As the doors SHUT we go to-

51 INT. HULK'S WARRIOR SUITE - DAY 51

     Thor's eyes POP OPEN. He's lying in a heap on the ground,
     still dirty, bruised, and beat up.

     Thor is being tended to by TWO SAKAARIAN GLADIATOR NURSES who
     are swabbing his wounds. This freaks him out, which results
     in startled thrashing. That freaks out the two Gladiator
     nurses, which results in them RUNNING AWAY.
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  59.


Thor starts to get up, but then winces. He moves slowly.
He's in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on the
walls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wanders
around. There's furniture, large cushions, and a sleeping
area enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast.
NOISE behind him. Thor follows the noise to find-
Hulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Thor
looks at him quizzically. Hulk isn't angry. He's RELAXED,
but he's not turning into Banner.

                   THOR
         Are we cool?

Hulk grunts. I guess so.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         It's Hulk in a hot tub.
             (then:)
         How long have you been like that?

                      HULK
         Like what?

                      THOR
         Like this.     Big, green, ...stupid.

                   HULK
         Hulk always Hulk.

Thor takes this in, and then walks over to a window that
looks out across the city. Does some spatial math, realizes:
Thor looks back out the window.
He sees a ramshackle SPACESHIP taking off and ROCKETING
skyward. Higher and higher, it's going for a wormhole when-
-BOOM! One of Grandmaster's Palace Patrol ships, more modern
and heavy duty, BLOWS it out of the sky.
On Thor, wheels turning. He turns to Hulk.

                   THOR
         How'd you get here?

                      HULK

         Quinjet.

Hulk mimes a plane landing in the water.

                    THOR
         Yes.   Where is the Quinjet now?

Hulk stands up, and exits the hot tub, naked.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         That's naked. He's very naked.
         It's in my brain now.

Hulk points out the window.

                      HULK
         Quinjet.

Thor sees the Quinjet in a massive alien junkyard.

                   THOR
         Yes! I'm getting us out of here.
         This is a terrible, awful place.
         You're gonna love Asgard. It's
         big. It's golden. Shiny.

Hulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin.

                      HULK
         Hulk stay.

                   THOR
         No, no, no. My people need me to

         Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
         You're of the Avengers. One of the
         team, one of our friends. This is
         what friends do. They support each
         other.

         I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer

         Fine. Stay here. Stupid place.
         It's hideous, by the way. The red,
         the white. Just pick a color.

Thor heads for the exit, a wide open door.

                 Moron!   You big child.

     Thor heads to the open entrance.      Hulk smiles, anticipating.

                            HULK
                 Thor go!

                           THOR
                 I am going.

     ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.       There are
     perimeter sensors in the doorway.

     Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.      Points.

                            HULK
                 Thor go again!

     TIME CUT:

     Thor slumps against the wall, head sagging.

     Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.       He's armored up.

                           HULK (CONT'D)
                 Hulk trains.

                 That's great. Have fun.

     Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the
     hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play-
     fighting, a clearly friendly rapport.

     Thor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the
     time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone.

     Thor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a
     wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.

                           THOR (CONT'D)

A57 Heimdall, I know you can see me. A57

     Thor continues his plea at the window.

                 I need you to help me. Help me
                 see.

     Pause. Then Thor's eyes go golden like Heimdall's!         The
     stars in the wormhole begin to WARP OVER THOR AND-

AA57 INT. STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME AA57

      Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first,
      Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows.

      Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up
      against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees.

      After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by
      through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause.

      Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.

                          HEIMDALL
                I see you. But you are far away.

                          THOR
                What's going on here?

                          HEIMDALL
                Come see for yourself.

      Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley
      and DASHES down the street. Thor follows...

      ...but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF
      ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight.

      Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow
      down. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove.

      Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another
      roving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions for
      Thor to ""shh"" until the threat has passed. Then:

                          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
                I'm providing refuge in a
                stronghold build by our ancestors.
                But if the garrison falls our only
                escape will is Bi-Frost.

                          THOR
                You're talking about evacuating
                Asgard?

                          HEIMDALL
                We won't last long if we stay.

      Thor LOOKS OUT on a ravaged Asgard, heartsick.

          Come on.

As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:

                    HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Hela is ravenous. If I let her
          leave, she'll consume the Nine
          Realms and all the cosmos.

                    HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
          We need you.

                    THOR
          I'm working on it, but I don't even
          really know where the hell I am.

Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously. Spot Heimdall.

                    HEIMDALL
          You're on a planet surrounded by
          doorways. Go through one.

                       THOR
          Which one?

Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.

                    HEIMDALL
          The big one!

WHOOSH! SUDDENLY THOR'S GONE! BLACK.
After slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves towards

                        HULK
              THOR SAD!!!

    Thor hops up, YELLS in Hulk's face.    Paces around.

                        THOR
              I'm not sad, you idiot. I'm pissed
              off! Angry. I lost my father. I
              lost my hammer.

    THUD! THUD! He turns to see Hulk punching his pillow.

    Hulk stops. Stares.

                        HULK
              Whining and crying.   Cry like baby.

                        THOR
              You're not even listening.

    Thor KICKS a random helmet.

                        HULK
              Don't kick stuff.

                        THOR
              You're being a really bad friend.

                        HULK
              You bad friend!

                        THOR
              You know what we call you?

                          HULK
              No.

                        THOR
              We call you the stupid Avenger.
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                66.



                   HULK
         You're tiny Avenger!

Hulk throws a shield that nearly decapitates Thor.

                   THOR
         What, are you crazy?

                      HULK
         Yes.

                   THOR
         You know what? Earth does hate you.

Hulk gets sad. Wanders over to his bed to mope.
Thor realizes he went to far. Joins Hulk on the bed.

                      HULK
         No.

                   THOR
         I'm sorry I said those things.
         You're not the stupid Avenger.
         Nobody calls you the stupid
         Avenger.

                      HULK
         It's okay.

                    THOR
         You just can't go around throwing
         shields at people. Could have
         killed me.

                   HULK
         I know. I'm sorry.     I just get so
         angry all the time.    Hulk always,
         always angry.

                   THOR
         I know. We're the same, you and I.
         We're just a couple of hot-headed
         fools.

                   HULK
         Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor
         like water.

                   THOR
         We're kind of both like fire.
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                67.



                     HULK
           But Hulk like real fire. Hulk like
           raging fire. Thor like smoldering
           fire.

                     THOR
           Hulk, I need you to do something
           for me.

TIME CUT: Morning.
BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM!
We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite.
Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so
hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns.
Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave...
Valkyrie and Hulk face off.

                     HULK
           Angry girl!

Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug.
Hulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val.

                     VALKYRIE
           What's going on? What do you...?

Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile
disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a
little. Like, ""I done bad."" Turns back to Thor:

                     VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
           You're so thick-headed that you
           can't tell when someone's hiding
           all the way across the universe and
           wants to be left alone?

                     THOR
           We need to talk.

                     VALKYRIE
           No, you want to talk to me.

Valkyrie turns to leave.

                     THOR
               (to Hulk:)
           I need her to stay.

Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk's
massive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway.

                      BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  68.


Val shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk. Hulk SNORTS back.

                     HULK
         Stay!    Please?

Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max.
Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again.
Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED
BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it
down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.

                   VALKYRIE
         All right. Here's the deal. I'll
         listen to you till this is empty.

She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING.

                   THOR
         Asgard is in danger and people are
         dying. We need to get back there. I
         need your help...wow.

                   VALKYRIE
         Finished. Bye.

She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.

                   THOR
         Odin is dead.

Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her
silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Hela, the Goddess of Death has
         invaded Asgard.

                   VALKYRIE
         If Hela's back then Asgard is
         already lost.

                   THOR
         I'm going to stop her.

                     VALKYRIE
         Alone?

                   THOR
         Nope. I'm putting together a team.
         It's me, you, and the big guy.
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   69.



                    HULK
         No team.   Only Hulk.

                   THOR
         It's me and you.

                   VALKYRIE
         I think it's only you.

                   THOR
         Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie
         are legend, elite warriors of
         Asgard. You are sworn to defend
         the throne.

                    VALKYRIE
         I'm not getting dragged into
         another one of Odin's family
         squabbles.

                   THOR
         What's that supposed to mean?

                   VALKYRIE
         Your sister. Her power comes from
         Asgard, same as yours.

Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT. Val
picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.

                   VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
         When it grew beyond Odin's control,
         she massacred everyone in the
         palace and tried to seize the
         throne. When she tried to escape
         her banishment, he sent the
         Valkyrie in to fight her back. I
         only survived because...
             (trails off, brooding)
         Look, I already faced her once back
         when I believed in the throne, and
         it cost me everything. THAT'S
         what's wrong with Asgard. The
         throne, the secrets, the whole
         golden sham.

Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting
hand on her shoulder.

                    THOR
         I agree.

Val SNATCHES his hand. They are close, face to face.

                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              70.



                   VALKYRIE
         Don't get familiar.

                   THOR
         I agree. That's why I turned down
         the throne. But this isn't about
         the crown. This is about the
         people. They're dying and they're
         you're people, too.

Val SHOVES him away. Thor stumbles back.

                      VALKYRIE
         Forget it.     I have.

                   THOR
             (nods, understanding)
         Okay.

                      VALKYRIE
         Okay.

                   THOR
         Good. Great.

                      VALKYRIE
         Great.

                      THOR
         Thank you.

                      VALKYRIE
         For what?

                      THOR
         For this.

Reveal that Thor has lifted the fob device off Val's belt!

                   THOR (CONT'D)
         Didn't see that did you?

Thor presses the button and ALL THE OBEDIENCE DISKS EMBEDDED
IN HIS NECK AND BELT POWER DOWN! Confident smirk.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
         There... that's better. You know,
         go ahead. Stay here and get drunk
         and enslave people for that
         lunatic. Keep drinking. Keep
         hiding.
             (beat)
         But me...
                            BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   71.



    Thor gestures for Hulk to toss him the ball.   Hulk does.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              I choose to run toward my problems
              and not away from them. Because
              that's what...

    Thor HURLS IT at the MAIN WINDOW - It bounces off, hitting
    Thor in the face. He stands, facing Valkyrie.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Because that's what heroes do.

    Thor then SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW!   Hulk STANDS...

                        HULK
              Friend Stay!


60 EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY 60

    Thor is sliding down the SIDE of the GRANDMASTER'S TOWER.

    He LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE BUILDING and hurtles downward,
    LANDING casually on the street below. Finally free.


61 EXT. THE STREETS OF SAKAAR - CONTINUOUS 61

    Thor is HAULING ASS.

    Never slowing down, Thor keeps the top of the arena in sight.

    A few blocks back: Hulk is in pursuit. He's BUMPING people,
    SWATTING vehicles out of the way, just being a menace.

    On Sakaar, the citizens APPLAUD for him! Even when Hulk
    DEMOLISHES a man's food cart, the man CHEERS Hulk on!


62 EXT. MASSIVE ALIEN JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS 62

    Thor SPRINTS in.   Looks around.   Man, this place is big.

    He RUNS down aisles of crushed and stripped spacecrafts, a
    giant smelter, and then into what looks like a used car lot.

    And then he sees it.   The Quinjet!


63 INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS 63

    Thor enters and rushes to the controls.

         All right.     Come on.

He is pressing buttons and flipping switches. After a beat-
-the flight deck POWERS UP! Thor places his hand on a pad
which SCANS his handprint. Lights up green.

         Welcome, Point Break.

CAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door!
The Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in his
way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console.

                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              73.



                   HULK
         Friend stay!

                   THOR
         No, no, no!

As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet.

                      HULK
         Stay!

                   THOR
         Stop! Stop breaking everything!

                      HULK
         Don't go!

Thor triggers a message on the flight console.

                   NATASHA (V.O.)
         Nice work, big guy. We don't know
         where Ultron's headed, but you're
         going very high, very fast.

Hulk stops short. His whole demeanor changes.
Thor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded
message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console.

                   NATASHA (V.O.)
         ...So, I need you to turn this bird
         around, okay? We can't track you in
         stealth mode...

Hulk is now right up against the console screen.

                   NATASHA (V.O.)
         ...So I need you to help me out.
         Okay? I need you to...

                      HULK
         No!     No, Banner!

Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole
body warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his
head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it...
...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition
is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get
out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back
and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet.
And then, calm.

                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 74.


Thor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition.

                   THOR
         Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all
         right, Banner? Sun's going down.
         Sun's going down. That's it,
         breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's
         going down.

                    BANNER
         ...Thor?

                    THOR
         Yeah.

Banner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, and
observations begin to flood his brain randomly.

                   BANNER
         What happened to your hair?

                   THOR
         Some creepy old man cut it off.

                   BANNER
         It looks good.

         Where are we? How's Nat?

         Nat is good, I'm sure.

         And what about Sokovia?

         Sokovia?

         The city, Sokovia.   Did we save it?

         What?

         I'm afraid so.

Banner's eyes BULGE. Trying to process this information.

                   BANNER
         What the hell happened?

Banner rushes to his feet. Thor follows.

                   THOR
         Banner, there's something you
         should know...

Banner goes to the flight console.

         Ship's log...

THE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN.
FROM BEHIND THE DISPLAY (within the monitor looking out) we
see fragmented images of the Hulk's trip through deep space.
We see the angry green giant thrash around in zero gravity.
We see Hulk closer to the camera now, looking stressed and
car sick.
THROW FOCUS to see Banner's face watching the video, Hulk's
freaked out face is super-imposed over Banner's freaked out
face.

         Yeah, about that.

Banner hears:

                   GRANDMASTER (O.S.)
         It's bad news, bad news today.

Banner rushes over to the windshield. Through it he sees-
-Grandmaster, his hologram projection towering over the city.

                   GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
         Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please.

                   BANNER
         Who's that?

                   THOR
         He kind of runs the place. You
         actually lived in his house.

Back to Banner. A distant, confused stare.

                      BANNER
         I did?

                   THOR
         Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You
         and I had a fight recently.

                      BANNER
         Did I win?

                   THOR
         No, I won. Easily.

                   BANNER
         Doesn't sound right.

                   THOR
         Well, it's true.

                   GRANDMASTER
         It seems that that criminally
         seductive Lord of Thunder has
         stolen him away.

                        THOR
              Seductive GOD of Thunder.    We need
              to move.

                        BANNER
              Oh, no. This is bad. This is
              really, really bad. Thor, I think
              I'm freaking out.

                        THOR
              No, no, no. Don't freak out.
              You're okay. Put these on.

    Thor tosses Banner some clothes.    Banner looks at them.

                        BANNER
              These are Tony's clothes.

                        THOR
              I know, come on.

                        BANNER
              Is he here?

                        THOR
              No, he's not here. But listen.
              Just stay calm, okay? The sun's
              going down. The sun's getting
              really low. Sun's going down.


67 INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - DAY 67

    Loki and Valkyrie are brought before Grandmaster, who has at
    least tripled the amount of bodyguards around him.

                        GRANDMASTER
              I'm upset! I'm very upset. You
              know what I like about being upset?
              Blame. Right now, that's the
              mindset that I'm in. And you know
              who I'm blaming?

                        LOKI
              Grandmaster, I-

                        GRANDMASTER
              Hey! Don't interrupt me!

    Topaz hands the melt stick to the grandmaster.

                        TOPAZ
              Here you go.

                        GRANDMASTER
              Why are you handing me the melt
              stick? He was interrupting. That's
              not a capital violation.
                  (refocuses)
              My precious champion has come up
              missing and its all because of that
              Lord of Thunder. It's all because
              of him.
                  (to Loki)
              YOUR brother. Whatever the story
              is. Adopted, or complicated. I'm
              sure there's a big history.
                  (to Valkyrie)
              And YOUR contender.

                        LOKI
              My dear friend, if you were to give
              me twelve hours I could bring them
              both back to you.

                        VALKYRIE
              I can do it in two.

                        LOKI
              I could do it in one.

                         GRANDMASTER
              You know what? I woke up this
              morning thinking about a public
              execution. But for now, I'll
              settle for this sweet little ""who's
              gonna get him first?"" So you're on
              the clock.


64 INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY 64

    Valkyrie exits in a hurry.   Loki follows her.

                        LOKI
              What have you done!?

    Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall.

                        VALKYRIE
              I don't answer to you, lackey.

                        LOKI
              It's Loki. And you will answer to
              the Grandmaster.
                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  79.



    Loki moves to reverse position again, but Val BREAKS AWAY,
    drawing her TWO BLADES. In response, Loki UNSHEATHES two
    long Sakaarian daggers. They eye each other, and then-

    -FIGHT! A fast-paced and deadly battle of knives. After a
    few exchanges, Val connects a BIG SHOT that SLAMS Loki into
    the wall. He scowls.

                        LOKI (CONT'D)
              Why would you help my brother
              escape with that green fool?

                        VALKYRIE
              I don't help anyone.

    Loki trails off.   He sees her wrist markings.   A realization.

                        LOKI
              You're a Valkyrie. I thought the
              Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?

    Now Val ATTACKS Loki! She gets him up against the wall, her
    blade against his throat. She looks ready to kill him.

                        VALKYRIE
              Choose your next words wisely.

                        LOKI
              Terribly sorry. Must be a very
              painful memory...

    Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val's head and CASTS an
    illusion. Val's eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to:


65 EXT. HELA'S DIMENSION - FLASHBACK 65

    A barren black void of death.

    The VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge through
    the DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nine
    Realms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time.

    - Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere.

    - Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space.

    - The Valkyrie's winged horses lay dead on the battlefield.

    - Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard.

    - Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val,
    frozen in fear, shell-shocked.
                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               80.



    - Hela FIRING black weapons at Val...

    - One of Val's sisters DIVING IN at the last second, SHOVING
    VAL back through the PORTAL and taking the fatal hit!

    - Val lands hard in the Throne room.

    - Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rift
    but it's too late. It closes, the last image she sees is Hela
    dealing the final killer blow to her doomed Valkyrie sisters.


66 EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS 66

    We find Val on her knees in front of Loki, trembling from
    this visceral memory that she's tried so hard to suppress.

    She turns on Loki, raging, and knocks him out.


69 EXT. SAKAAR - STOOP - DAY 69

    BANNER sits, groaning, head in his hands. THOR is beside
    him, rubbing his back and on the lookout for threats.

                        THOR
              The sun's going down. It's getting
              really low. The sun's going down.
              It's getting real low.

                        BANNER
              Would you stop saying that!?

                        THOR
              I just need you to stay calm.

                         BANNER
              Calm!?   I'm on an alien planet!

                        THOR
              It's just a planet.   You've been on
              a planet before.

                          BANNER
              Yeah!    One!

                        THOR
              Now you've been on two. That's a
              good thing. It's a new experience.

                        BANNER
              My neurons, they're firing faster
              than my brain can handle the

          BANNER (CONT'D)

The whole thing is totally
different this time.

   (beat)

In the past, I always felt like
Hulk and I each had a hand on the
wheel, but this time it's like he
had the keys and I was locked in
the trunk.

         THOR

Alright, well, you're back now,
that's all that matters.

         BANNER

No, it's not what matters. What
I'm trying to tell you, is that if
I turn into the Hulk again, Banner
may never come back. And we're
stranded on a planet that is
designed to stress me out.

         THOR

We're not stranded, I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us home.

            BANNER

Thank you.

         THOR

Not your home, though. Asgard.

            BANNER

What?

         THOR

Listen, my people are in great
danger. You and I, we have to
fight this really powerful being
who also happens to be my sister.

         BANNER

Okay, that is so wrong on so
many... I don't wanna fight your
sister. That's a family issue.

         THOR

No, she's an evil being.

         BANNER

I don't care what she is. I'm not
fighting any more beings. I'm sick
of it. I just told you.

         If I turn into the Hulk, I am never
         gonna come back again. And you
         don't care.

                   THOR
         No, no. I'm putting together the
         team. The Hulk is the fire.

                   BANNER
         Wait, you're just using me to get
         to the Hulk.

                       THOR
         What?   No!

                   BANNER
         It's gross. You don't care about
         me. You're not my friend.

                   THOR
         No! I don't even like the Hulk.
         He's all like... ""smash, smash,
         smash."" I prefer you.

                       BANNER
         Thanks.

                   THOR
         But if I'm being honest, when it
         comes to fighting evil beings, he
         is very powerful and useful.

                   BANNER
         Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful,
         too.

                   THOR
         Is he though?

                   BANNER
         How many PhDs does Hulk have?
         Zero. How many PhDs does Banner
         have? Seven.

                   THOR
         Fine, you don't have to fight
         anyone. But we're in danger here,
         so we have to move.

Thor grabs a towel from the ground next to him. He puts the
towel over his head.

                   BANNER
         What are you doing with that?

                   THOR
         I need a disguise.    I'm a fugitive.

                   BANNER
         I need a disguise.

                   THOR
         You are the disguise.

Banner finds a pair of Stark's sunglasses in his jacket.

                   BANNER
         I'll be Tony Stark.

                    THOR
         What?

                    BANNER
         Yeah.   Tony and the gypsy.

                   THOR
         No, no you're not Tony.    You're
         Bruce Banner.

                   BANNER
         Then why did you dress me up like
         Tony?

                   THOR
         Because you were naked.

                   BANNER
         Okay, I'll give you that.

They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch.

                   THOR
         What are you doing?    Stop doing
         that!

                   BANNER
         Tony wears his pants super tight!

                   THOR
         Why are you being so weird?

                   BANNER
         I don't know. Maybe the fact that I
         was trapped for two years inside of
         a monster made me a little weird.

Banner flashes green. Thor calms him down.

                          THOR
                Hey. It's okay. You're good.
                Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're
                gonna go to Asgard and you're not
                gonna have to think about the Hulk
                ever again. All right?

                             BANNER
                All right.

     WHAP!   Banner gets nailed in the face with green paint.

     Caught off guard, Thor and Banner are swept off into-


69A EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS 69A

     It's a massive street festival where revelers dance and cheer
     while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration
     of Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE!

     Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner
     as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd
     Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward.

     Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and
     pulls him into another alley, but sees-

     -Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!

                          THOR
                This is bad. Banner!     Banner!

     Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to
     see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a
     SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright.

     Thor sees Banner across the crowd.

     Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans
     aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively,
     awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders.

     One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a
     MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner.

     WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper
     with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS.

     Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

                             THOR (CONT'D)

               Hi.

                         THOR
               I was gonna do that.

                         VALKYRIE
               Yeah, well, I did it first.

                         THOR
               That's good. What are you doing
               here?

                         VALKYRIE
               What are you doing here?   I thought
               you were leaving.

                         THOR
               I got sidetracked.

                         VALKYRIE
               What's with the...

                         THOR
               It's my disguise.

                         VALKYRIE
               But I can see your face.

                         THOR
                   (covers his face)
               Not when I do this, you can't.
                   (then:)
               Your hair looks nice. I like what
               you did with it. Change it? Washed
               it maybe?

     Valkyrie just rolls her eyes, takes Thor by the arm.

                         BANNER
                   (to Thor:)
               What are those things on her eyes?
               Are those the people that she's
               killed? She's so beautiful and
               strong...


69B EXT. SAKAARIAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 69B

     Valkyrie escorts Thor and Banner through the street.

                         VALKYRIE
               Who is this guy?

               He's a friend.

                             BANNER
               Who?    Me?    I'm Bruce.

     As Val leads them into Sakaarian apartment building.

                         VALKYRIE
               I feel like I know you.

                         BANNER
               I feel like I know you too.

     Continue down the hallway.

                         VALKYRIE
               Look, I've spent years in a haze
               trying to forget my past. Sakaaar
               seemed like the best place to drink
               and forget and to die one day.

                         THOR
               I was thinking that you drink too
               much, and that probably was going
               to kill you.

                         VALKYRIE
               I don't plan to stop drinking, but
               I don't want to forget. I can't
               turn away anymore. So, if I'm
               donna to die, well... it may as
               well be driving my sword through
               the heart of that murderous hag.

                             THOR
               Good.

     They arrive at a door.     Before they enter:

                         VALKYRIE
               Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna
               be on the team. Has it got a name?

                         THOR
               Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
                             BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               87.



                           VALKYRIE
              Revengers?

                        THOR
              Because I'm getting revenge.
              You're getting revenge.
                  (to Banner:)
              Do you want revenge?

                        BANNER
              I'm undecided.

                           THOR
              Okay.

                        VALKYRIE
              Also, I've got a peace offering.


73 INT. VALKYRIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 73

    Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing-

    -Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in
    the middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him.

                           LOKIE
              Surprise.

    Thor TOSSES a bottle.    It BOUNCES off of Loki's head.

                           LOKI
              OW!

                        THOR
              Just had to be sure.

                        LOKI
              Hello, Bruce.

                        BANNER
              So, last time I saw you, you were
              trying to kill everybody. Where
              are you at these days?

                        LOKI
              It varies from moment to moment.

    Val's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood-
    spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc.

    Banner gives Thor a look like ""she might be crazy.""   Thor
    responds with a ""No, she's cool"" gesture.
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                88.


Val lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD
ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it.

                   THOR
         Is that... a Dragonfang?

                   VALKYRIE
         It is.

                   THOR
         My God. This is the famed sword of
         the Valkyrie.

                   VALKYRIE
         Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
         apart as any two known systems.
         Our best bet is a wormhole just
         outside the city limits.

A nice clean wormhole outside the city.

                   VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
         Refuel on Xandar and be back in
         Asgard in around 18 months.

                   THOR
         Nope. We're going through that one.

Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean.

                   VALKYRIE
         The Devil's Anus?

                   BANNER
         Wait, whose anus are we going
         through?

                   THOR
         For the record, I didn't know it
         was called that when I picked it.

                   BANNER
         That looks like a collapsing
         neutron star inside of an Einstein-
         Rosen Bridge.

                   VALKYRIE
         We need another ship.   That would
         tear mine to pieces.

                   THOR
         She's right. We need one that can
         withstand the geodetic strain from
         the singularity.
                     BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   89.


Banner gives Thor a quizzical look.

                   BANNER
         And has an offline power steering
         system that could also function
         without the on-board computer.

                   VALKYRIE
         And we need one with cup holders,
         because we're gonna die. So,
         drinks!

                   BANNER
         Do I know you? I feel like I know
         you.

                   VALKYRIE
         I feel like I know you, too. It's
         weird.

                   THOR
             (to Banner:)
         What do you say, doctor? Uncharted
         metagalactic travel through a
         volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about
         an adventure.

Thor and Banner high five as Val stares at them blankly.

           BANNER                      THOR (CONT'D)

We need a ship. Need a ship.

                   VALKYRIE
         There are one or two ships,
         absolute top-of-the-line models--

                   LOKI
         I don't mean to impose, but the
         Grandmaster has a great many ships.
         I may eve have stolen the access
         codes to his security system.

All eyes turn to Loki. Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. It
smashes above his head.

                   VALKYRIE
         And suddenly you're overcome with
         an urge to do the right thing.

                   LOKI
         Heavens, no. I've run out of favor
         with the Grandmaster.

                   LOKI (CONT'D)
         And in exchange for codes and
         access to a ship I'm asking for
         safe passage...through the anus.

                   THOR
         You're telling us you can get us
         access into the garage without
         setting off any alarms?

                   LOKI
         Yes, brother. I can.

                   BANNER
         Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I
         was just talking to him just a
         couple minutes ago and he was
         totally ready to kill any of us.

                   VALKYRIE
         He did try to kill me.

                   THOR
         Yes, me too. On many, many
         occasions. There was one time when
         we were children, he transformed
         himself into a snake, and he knows
         that I love snakes. So, I went to
         pick up the snake to admire it and
         he transformed back into himself
         and he was like, ""Yeah, it's me!""
         And he stabbed me. We were eight
         at the time.

Loki suppresses a smile.

                   VALKYRIE
         If we're boosting a ship, we're
         gonna need to draw some guards away
         from the palace.

                   LOKI
         Why not set the beast loose?

                    THOR
         Shut up.

                   VALKYRIE
         You guys have a beast?

                   THOR
         No, there's no beast. He's just
         being stupid. We're going to start
         a revolution.

75 INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - MOMENTS LATER 75

    Korg sits with his cell mates.    He's talking to Miek.

                        KORG
              Is that some sort of protoplasm,
              all the stuff that's coming out of
              you? Or are they eggs? Looks like
              eggs.

    Suddenly his Obedience Disk POWERS DOWN. No longer glowing.

    As Korg stands up, Valkyrie appears at the door to his cell.

                        VALKYRIE
              I'm looking for Korg.

                        KORG
              Who's asking? I know you're
              asking. Is anyone else asking, or
              is it just you?

    Valkyrie tosses him a high-tech rifle.

               Don't know. But the Arena's
               mainframe for the Obedience Disks
               have been deactivated and the
               slaves have armed themselves.

                         GRANDMASTER
               Oh! I don't like that word!

                            TOPAZ
               Mainframe?

                         GRANDMASTER
               No. Why would I not like
               ""mainframe?"" No, the ""S"" word.

                         TOPAZ
               Sorry, the ""prisoners with jobs""
               have armed themselves.

               Okay, that's better.

     CHA-CHNK! SOUNDS OF MACHINERY as the whole space starts
     moving. A different angle reveals that we are in-


A77 EXT. THE STATESMAN - CONTINUOUS A77

     Grandmaster's chambers are actually the oversized cockpit of
     a A HUGE RIOT CONTROL SHIP (The Statesman) that can dock
     itself indefinitely within the palace!

     The Statesman has DISLODGED from the palace and is now
     flanked by six smaller Sakaarian peace-keeping ships, all
     headed towards the city where RIOTING can be heard.

               Hey, so listen, we should talk.

                         LOKI
               I disagree. Open communication was
               never our family's forte.

                         THOR
               You have no idea. I've had quite
               the revelation since we spoke last.

     The door opens, revealing a bunch of guards.

    Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door.

                        LOKI (CONT'D)
              Odin brought us together, it's
              almost poetic that his death should

                        THOR
              That's exactly what I was thinking.

                        LOKI

Loki is wounded by Thor's willingness to discard him. Masks
his feelings with:

Hold on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him?

     We follow the real Loki as he slinks away towards the
     security system panel. He activates the panel and brings up a
     screen that will set off all the alarms palace-wide!

                           THOR (O.S.)
               Oh, Loki.

     Loki turns to see Thor looking not at all surprised.

                         LOKI
               I know I've betrayed you many times
               before, but this time it's truly
               nothing personal. The reward for
               your capture will set me up nicely.

     He triggers the alarm.


82B INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 82B

                         THOR
               Never one for sentiment, were you?

                         LOKI
               Easier to let it burn.

     But then Loki sees Thor holding up a fob device. Loki
     realizes that Thor affixed an Obedience Disk on him in that
     heart-to-heart moment.

                           THOR
               I agree.

     BZZZT! Thor ZAPS Loki and HOLDS DOWN the button. Loki HITS
     the ground, WRITHING in pain. Thor approaches. Pause.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Oh brother, you're becoming
               predictable. I trust you, you
               betray me. Round and round in
               circles we go.

     Thor continues to ""think about it"" for a beat while Loki
     convulses in agony on the floor. Finally, Thor kneels down:

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               See, Loki, life is about, it's
               about growth. It's about change.
               But you seem to just wanna stay the
               same. I guess what I'm trying to
               say is that you'll always be the
               God of Mischief, but you could be
               more. I'll just put this over here
               for you.

     Thor places the fob on top of the security panel, so close
     but so far from Loki's paralyzed reach.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Anyway, I got places to be so good
               luck.


82C INT. COMMODORE SHIP - MOMENTS LATER 82C

     Thor is seen in the cockpit.

                         THOR
               All right, I can figure this out.
               It's just another spaceship.


83 EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - MOMENTS LATER 83

     The massive garage doors OPEN. This sets off BLARING ALARMS
     to alert the palace of this unauthorized departure.

     The Commodore ship LIFTS OFF from the garage. In the cockpit
     Thor pushes forward on the throttle. The ship ZOOMS ahead.

                         GRANDMASTER
               Loyal Sakaarians, Lord of Thunder
               has stolen my ship and my favorite
               champion. Sakaarians, take to the
               skies. Bring him down. Do not let
               him leave this planet.

     BELOW: Pilots hastily RUSH to their Palace Patrol ships so
     as to pursue the Commodore.

     The first two ships out of the garage SWOOP AROUND behind
     Thor. The Patrol ships are LOCKING weapons on Thor when-

     -BOOM-BOOM!   They are both blown out of the sky by-


84 INT. WARSONG SHIP - SAME 84

     Val is all focus, flying and FIRING. Banner sits shotgun.

                            BANNER
               Good shot!


85 EXT. SAKAAR - DAY 85

     Thor's ship and Val's ship now ZIP through the city in
     tandem. On the horizon we can see-
                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    98.



    -the Statesman, the enlarged Grandmaster, and his Riot
    Control team raining down hell on the revolting prisoners.


86 INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS 86

    Thor in the pilot's seat.     Val comes in over the radio.

                         VALKYRIE (V.O.)
               Open the doors.

    Thor looks over the console.    FLIPS a switch.


87 INT. WARSONG SHIP - CONTINUOUS 87

    Valkyrie STEERS down, dropping altitude. Her whole ship
    spins upside down, yet her cockpit is still right-side up.

                         VALKYRIE
               I hope that you're tougher than you
               look.

                         BANNER
               Why?

    Val MAXES OUT the throttle. The ship ACCELERATES.     When
    she's under Thor's ship, Val presses-

    -THE EJECT BUTTON!   Banner is LAUNCHED OUT OF THE SHIP!


88 INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS 88

    Thor at the controls. We hear an incoming scream of
    increasing volume. ""aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!""

    THUNK!   Banner is SHOT UP into the ship. ROUGH LANDING.

    Banner casually lifts his arm up and gives a THUMBS UP.

    CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! The ship is being fired upon by
    another pursuit vehicle. Banner joins Thor.

                          BANNER
               Shouldn't we be shooting back or
               something?

                         THOR
               Yes, we should.
                   (into the radio:)
               Where are the guns on this ship?

                         VALKYRIE (V.O.)
               There aren't any. It's a leisure
               vessel.

                         THOR / BANNER
               WHAT?!

                         VALKYRIE
               Grandmaster uses it for his good
               times, orgies and stuff.

     Thor and Banner look around. The CEILING has MIRRORS ON IT
     and the floor is covered in a Sakaarian PERSIAN RUG.

                         BANNER
               Did she just say the Grandmaster
               uses it for orgies?

                         THOR
               Yeah. Don't touch anything.

     CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! More fire from behind.


A89 INT. WARSONG SHIP - THE SAME A89

     Val's ship is hit. She rotates the cockpit to face BACKWARDS
     and opens fire, taking out the attacking chase-ship.

     But now in Val's cockpit... Sparks. Smoke. Alarms.

     In the distance Val clocks the Grandmaster's Riot Ship
     raining terror down on the masses. A look of determination as
     she pops the HATCH above - her ship is now a convertible.


89 EXT. SAKAAR - CONTINUOUS 89

     Meanwhile, Warsong ZOOMS out from under Thor's ship, still
     ACCELERATING. Val has turned her ship into a missile, and
     its trajectory is the Grandmaster's Riot Control Ship!

     Grandmaster is still taunting his former captives below when-

     -KA-BOOM! Warsong SLAMS into the Statesman, specifically the
     Grandmaster's projection! Enlarged Grandmaster stumbles,
     struggling to maintain his balance.

     Warsong EXPLODES while the Statesman is knocked off kilter
     and goes down for a hard landing in the market!

    Thor and Banner witness the fiery explosion of Val's kamikaze
    flight path!

                        THOR
              No!

    Thor experiences a brief instant of heartbreak/devastation...

    ...but then notices a spec coming out of the explosion.

    THWACK! Val hits the ship's windshield and grabs hold!
    Residual smoke wafting off of her.


91 OMITTED 91
92 EXT. SAKAAR - THE WASTELANDS - CONTINUOUS 92

    Thor pilots the ship out of the city into the Wastelands as
    six Sakaarian fighter ships race after them in formation.

    The following dogfight will proceed across the Wastelands and
    then out over the Sakaarian Ocean.


93 INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS 93

    Val is still on the windshield. GUNFIRE! One of the
    pursuing ships WINGS the Commodore, causing it to LURCH.

                        THOR
              Get inside!

                        VALKYRIE
              In a minute!

    Val pulls herself up and then RUNS DOWN THE ROOF OF THE SHIP!

    Thor and Banner follow the THUMPING of her footsteps.


94 EXT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS 94

    In full sprint, Val LEAPS OFF and-

    -LANDS HARD on the lead Sakaarian ship! Val begins TEARING
    into the enemy ship with her bare hands!


95 INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS 95

    Thor and Banner exchange a look.   Pause.

                         THOR
               I should probably go and help.

     Thor abruptly exits, leaving Banner at the ship's controls.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Here, take the wheel.

                         BANNER
               No. I don't know how to fly one of
               these.

                          THOR
               You're a scientist.   Use one of
               your PhDs.

                         BANNER
               None of them are for flying alien
               spaceships!


96 EXT. THE SAKAARIAN OCEAN - CONTINUOUS 96

     Thor LEAPS into the middle of this high-speed dogfight!

     These two superhuman Asgardians begin jumping between their
     pursuer's ships, taking out guns, engines, and pilots with
     their bare hands. It's spectacular and epic.

     Thor RIPS out an engine block and uses it to crush a pilot.

     Val DRAGS her blades down the entire underbelly of a ship
     before BACKFLIPPING to another.

     Back and forth they go, even passing each other mid-flight a
     few times. One by one the Sakaarian ships GO DOWN.


A97 INT. COMMODORE SHIP - SAME A97

     Banner is frantically STEERING the ship, doing his best to
     dodge all the incoming fire. He peels away and is followed
     by Topaz, who is in her own chase-ship.

     Banner notices a button with a little explosion icon.

                         BANNER
               Okay, come on. There's gotta be a
               gun on this thing. That looks like
               a gun.

     Banner PRESSES the button.

     The ship's lighting changes, like a disco effect. Weird dance
     music BLASTS over the PA, followed by Grandmaster's voice.

                         GRANDMASTER (V.O.)
               It's MY BIRTHDAY! It's MY BIRTHDAY!
               It's MY BIRTHDAY.

     Banner is so confused. Then we hear FIREWORKS.


B97 EXT. THE SAKAARIAN OCEAN - CONTINUOUS B97

     MASSIVE PLUMES of powder paint SHOOT OUT of the ship followed
     by a huge colorful fireworks display. And then a
     rainforest's worth of confetti is dumped from the hull!

     Topaz is suddenly in the middle of a party smoke screen! She
     tries to fly her way through all the fireworks and streamers,
     but ultimately she hits a HARD CRASH LANDING in the ocean.

                         BANNER
               Yeah!

     Meanwhile, Thor and Val land together on the one remaining
     Sakaarian ship. Val leaks a smile to Thor.

     Thor YANKS OFF the cockpit cover, Val TOSSES the pilot, and
     together they PUSH FORWARD on the throttle.

     The ship SPEEDS FORWARD. Just then Banner pulls the Commodore
     back on the scene, hovering above them.

     They LEAP UP towards the Commodore's open doors as the ship
     CRASHES and EXPLODES behind them!


97B INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS 97B

     Thor and Valkyrie join Banner in the cockpit.

                         VALKYRIE
               Guys, we're coming up on the
               Devil's Anus!


97F INT. GRANDMASTER'S GARAGE - DAY 97F

     KORG and MIEK enter, leading a group of gladiator rebels.

     Korg sees and then points to the SUPERCRUISER.

                         KORG
               There she is. Our ticket out of

     The OBEDIENCE DISK FOB on the ground.   He picks it up.

     Korg then notices LOKI, TWITCHING and CONVULSING on the
     ground. He's barely made any progress towards the fob.

     Loki locks eyes with Korg, a desperate and furious plea.

     Korg looks at Loki, then at the fob, then back to Loki.

     Loki gives Korg a maniacal, pleading look.

     Korg gets it.   He deactivates the obedience disk.

     Loki stands, dusts himself off.

                            LOKI
               Thank you.

                         KORG
               Hey man, we're about to jump on
               that ginormous spaceship. You
               wanna come?

                         LOKI
               You do seem like you're in
               desperate need of leadership.

     The Commodore ship is swallowed up by the towering nightmare
     that is the Devil's Anus wormhole.

     The ship's onboard computer SHORTS OUT. Darkness in the
     cabin. All around them the hull CREAKS. Under strain.

     The commodore heads toward the end of the wormhole.   Debris
     flies past the camera.

     Thor, Val, and Banner all look like they are in extreme pain,
     as there's great concern the ship could be torn apart.

     SKURGE ADDRESSES A CROWD OF ASGARDIANS.     HELA BEHIND HIM
     leaning against FENRIS, her GIANT WOLF.

                         SKURGE
               Asgardians, some misguided soul has
               stolen the Bifrost sword. Tell us
               where it is, or there will be
               consequences. Bad ones.

     We are now in the smoking ruins of Asgard. 100+ Asgardians
     have been forced to line in a large piazza, all exhausted,
     all scared. Patrolling the perimeter are Hela's Butchers.

                           SKURGE (CONT'D)
               Well?

     Hela points to an Asgardian woman off camera.

                           HELA
               You.

     Hela's butchers approach the crowd and find the Asgardian
     woman. Skurge closes his eyes and looks downward.

                           ASGARDIAN CITIZENS
               No! Stop!

     Hela's butchers pull the Asgardian woman to the steps. They
     shove her and she falls tot he floor. The woman is on her
     hands and knees as Skurge turns to her. She trembles as
     Skurge holds his battle axe with both hands.

                          HELA
               Well?   Executioner?

     Banner, Thor, and Valkyrie are all unconscious. Banner wakes
     up and looks outside, the stars reflected in the windshield.
     Thor and Valkyrie wake up. Outside they see-

     -THE REALM OF ASGARD, a flat city in the middle of an island
     floating in space.

                         VALKYRIE
                   (mixed emotions)
               I never thought I'd be back here.

     The ship descends into the clouds above Asgard.

                         BANNER
               I thought it'd be nicer. I mean,
               not that it's not nice. It's just,
               it's on fire.

     THE SHIP CLEARS THE CLOUDS TO REVEAL-

     -ASGARD IN RUINS. A DEVASTATED GHOST TOWN. FIRES, WRECKED
     BUILDINGS, DEAD SOLDIERS. IT LOOKS LIKE ALL HOPE IS LOST.

                         VALKYRIE
               Here, up here in the mountains.

     A projected map on the console shows the mountain where the

      Thor produces a bundle of FABRIC WITH GOLD AND WHITE PLATING.

                          THOR
                I found this in the armory.

      Val immediately recognizes its significance. She doesn't
      want to be affected by this gesture, but can't help it.

      They share a look as the Commodore lifts off into the air.
      Before she's out of earshot, Val calls down:

                          VALKYRIE
                ""Your majesty."" Don't die.    You
                know what I mean.

      The Commodore flies away, leaving Thor on the balcony.


109A INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 109A

      Thor's footsteps ECHO through the empty space. He sees the
      items from the vault scattered beside the throne.

      Thor sees a chunk of plaster from the dismantled fresco. He
      picks it up and sees that this piece of fresco bears a
      portion of his own face. Thor then looks up, off camera.

      His eyes go wide. He looks up at the ceiling where his
      painting used to be and finds the original which depicts Odin
      and Hela conquering the nine realms, with Hela's butchers all
      around them. Hela holds Mjolnir.

107 EXT. ASGARD - MOUNTAIN RAVINE - DAY 107

     Hela, cowl & headdress on, stands with Skurge outside of the
     mountain stronghold where Heimdall is hiding the refugees.
     Hela raises her arms and FIRES LONG THIN BLACK LANCES, which
     BURROW into crevices on the mountainside. From here, we TILT
     UP, looking straight at the sky.

     With the lances in place, Hela bears down. Summoning all her
     focus and energy, she begins to VIBRATE this manifestation of
     her powers, PUNCTURING crevices and splitting rock apart.

     The whole mountain begins to RUMBLE.

110 EXT. ASGARD - MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD - SAME 110

     CRACK!    Hela RIPS OPEN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN!

     There is an avalanche of rock and debris.     The mountain
     around the doors completely destroyed, the    doors fall across
     the ravine, creating a bridge for Hela and    Skurge. Hela
     waits patiently for the dust to settle and    sees-

     -an empty stronghold.    No sign of Heimdall or the refugees.


111 EXT. SECRET MOUNTAIN PATH - SAME 111

     Heimdall leads the migration of refugees out the other side
     of the mountain onto a secluded mountain path.

112 INT. COMMODORE - DUSK 112

     Banner flies the Commodore out across the city.

     Val puts on her gloves, cuff on her forearm, boots, and
     breastplate. She grabs her dragonfang sword and puts it at
     her side. Val mans the Blaster, and we see that she's changed
     into the CLASSIC WHITE & GOLD VALKYRIE ARMOR (Thor's gift).
     Bad ass.

113 EXT. MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD - DUSK 113

     Hela is about to throttle Skurge when-

     -A LOUD GONG SOUND. It's coming from far away, but the deep
     note resonates across the land. GONG-GONG-GONG-GONG!

     Hela looks to the Palace, her eyes narrowing with rage.


114 INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 114

     Find Thor on the throne holding GUNGNIR - THE KING'S SPEAR,
     Odin's signature spear. SLAMMING the butt of it on the
     ground. GONG...GONG...

     Hela steps into the throne room.   Headdress & cowl off.

     Thor stops the GONGING when he sees Hela.

                         THOR
               Sister.

     Smiling, Hela gradually crosses the huge space towards Thor.

                         HELA
               You're still alive.

                         THOR
               I love what you've done with the
               place. Redecorating, I see.

                         HELA
               It seems our father's solution to
               every problem was to cover it up.

                         THOR
               Or to cast it out.
                   (then:)
               He told you you were worthy.   He
               said the same thing to me.

     Angle on Hela in the frescos, fighting with Mjolnir.

                         HELA
               You see, you never knew him, not at
               his best.
                   (nostalgic sigh)
               Odin and I drowned entire
               civilizations in blood and tears.
               Where do you think all this gold
               came from? And then one day he
               decided to become a benevolent
               king.

               To have you.

                         THOR
               I understand why you're angry. And
               you are my sister, and technically
               have a claim to the throne. And
               believe me, I would love for
               someone else to rule. But it can't
               be you. You're just...the worst.

     Hela puts on her headdress.

                         HELA
               Okay, get up. You're in my seat.

               You know, Father once told me that
               a wise king never seeks out war.

               But must always be ready for it.

     They CHARGE each other.


115 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME 115

     Heimdall leads the refugees out onto the bridge.

     But then he stops.    Sensing something.

     At the far end of the bridge is FENRIS!      The massive war wolf
     is guarding the observatory!

                           HEIMDALL
               Go back!

     The refugees turn to retreat.    Fenris CHARGES!

     GUNFIRE FROM ABOVE!

     The Commodore swoops onto the scene, Valkyrie manning the
     blaster and FIRING on Fenris, who stops his charge.

     As the refugees retreat, they come to a stop because...

     ...SKURGE IS LEADING AN ARMY OF BUTCHERS BEHIND THEM!

     Heimdall and the refugees are now trapped on the bridge
     between Fenris and Skurge!

     Hela and Thor fight, Hela wielding twin black blades.

     They CLASH and Thor BLOCKS an attack with Gungnir.   They are
     face to face, Hela glaring at Thor.

                         HELA
               To be honest, I expected more.

     Hela DISARMS him, sending Gungnir CLATTERING across the room.
     Hela strikes out sending Thor FLYING hard into a wall.


117 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME 117

     Hela's butchers stand behind Skurge.

                           SKURGE
               Heimdall!    The sword!

     The Butcher army CHARGES

     Val and Banner hold the remaining Butchers off with GUNFIRE.

     Heimdall is looking toward the palace, concern for Thor. But
     his attention soon goes back to protecting the mass of
     humanity behind him. He looks out to the Observatory

                         HEIMDALL
               We must cross now! To Bi-Frost!

     Heimdall leads the refugees out onto the bridge.

               Here's the difference between us.
               I'm Odin's firstborn, the rightful
               heir, the savior of Asgard.
                   (beat)
               And you're nothing.

     Hela PROJECTS a large spiked lance, Thor barely rolls out of
     the way before it PUNCTURES the wall.

     Thor HEADBUTTS Hela. It does nothing.   Hela responds with her
     own HEADBUTT. It does a lot.

               So simple.     Even a blind man could
               see it.

     Hela RAKES a black-clawed hand across Thor's face. In doing
     so, she RIPS OUT ONE OF HIS EYES!

               Now you remind me of Dad.


119 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME 119

     Asgardians CLASH with Hela's Butchers.

     Valkyrie keeps raining down fire on Fenris, but it is doing
     no real damage. Just pissing the wolf off.

     Fenris shakes off the bullets and resumes CHARGING.

     Heimdall sees Fenris charging and steps out in front of the
     refugees with his sword, preparing for the worst.

     Banner soars through the air. It's an awe-inspiring image as
     we follow Banner's trajectory downwards. His face is
     determined, arms churning, ready to Hulk out...

     ...except it doesn't happen.     Worry washes over his face.

     SPLAT! Banner FACEPLANTS on the bridge, seeming to break
     every bone in his body. He looks dead.

     Pause. Fenris SNIFFS him curiously. We notice one vein on
     Banner's neck PUMPING GREEN. Then-

     -Banner suddenly EXPLODES UP as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, UPPER-
     CUTTING Fenris in the jaw! Hulk is now in a wrestling match
     with a beast four times his size - the two of them go

     Hela has Thor by the throat.     She lifts him up to look over

               You see? No one's going anywhere.
                   (then:)
               I'll get that sword even if I have
               to kill every single one of them to
               do it.

     Thor looks down.   Distraught.   Heartsick.


123 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 123

     Val pilots the Commodore towards the battle on the city side
     of the bridge. Skurge's battlion of Butchers surge forward-

     -BOOM! Val LANDS the Commodore on top of them, SKIDDING
     across the bridge, CRUSHING the front line of the Butchers,
     and KNOCKING Skurge aside. The impact triggers the party
     function, setting off PARTY MUSIC and a FIREWORKS DISPLAY.

     Val emerges from the ship in full battle mode. Behind her,
     the Commodore FIREWORKS provide a spectacular HERO BACKDROP.
     She draws DRAGONFANG and smiles as Butchers begin swarming
     towards her. She is where she needs to be.

     Meanwhile, the Asgardians huddle together, packed so tight
     that some begin to fall off the side of the bridge, loved
     ones grabbing them and pulling them back up. There's no hope.

Heimdall FIGHTS off Butchers, but gets KNOCKED DOWN. Just as
it looks like he's about to take a killing blow-
-BAM! The Butcher is BLASTED.
Korg steps into frame, holding the blaster!

                     KORG
          Hey man.   I'm Korg.   This is Miek.

Miek steps into frame, waving.

                    KORG (CONT'D)
          We're going to jump on that
          spaceship and get out of here.
          Want to come?

Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela
looks down to see-
-EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent
in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the
bridge like a mythical angel of mercy.

                    LOKI
          Your savior is here!

The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki's standing
on THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will
become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK.
And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisoners
from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons.
The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge.
ABOVE: Even with Hela's hand on his throat, Thor can't help
but smile at the sight of Loki. Hela however sneers.

BELOW: Loki and the Sakaarian gladiators JUMP OFF the Ark and
onto the bridge, joining the fight against Hela's forces.

                     LOKI
          Did you miss me?    Everybody on that
          ship, now.

The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only
way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an
immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people
all pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem.
Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall.

               A valiant effort, but you never

     Thor looks up from his friends protecting his people as they
     frenziedly board to Ark to-

                Even when you had two eyes you were
                only seeing half the picture.

      Thor turns to see his father, sitting where we last saw him.
      Thor falls to his knees.

                          THOR
                She's too strong.   Without my

                That hammer helped you control your
                power, focus it. But it was never

                It's too late. She's already taken
                Asgard.

                          ODIN
                Asgard is not a place. Never has
                been.
                    (gestures around him)
                This could be Asgard. It is

      instant, Thor and Hela are ENGULFED in a bolt of lightning!!

      KA-BOOM! Hela is BLASTED OUT of the lightning and sent

      In the water below, Hulk and Fenris WRESTLE in an colossal
      clash of FISTS, CLAWS, and TEETH.

      Beyond that, Thor is wielding electrified weapons and
      BLASTING entire packs of Butchers off the bridge!

      Lost in the chaos is Skurge, who sees the tides turning.   He
      throws down his axe and blends into the crowd.

      Hulk winds up and SLAMS Fenris in the snout!

      Fenris snaps back, revealing that-

      -THEY'VE REACHED THE REALM'S EDGE!

      Fenris is knocked off, plummeting off of Asgard into space.

      Hulk grabs hold of the slippery rocks, desperately trying to

      Our heroes have drastically thinned down the herd of
      Butchers.

      It's pandemonium. The Ark's engines are deafening, but you
      can still hear the sound of terrified people SCREAMING.

      Thor helps Loki to his feet.

                          THOR

      Valkyrie finishes off a handful of enemies, but then notices
      something. She WHISTLES to get the others' attention.

                This isn't over.

      All around the bridge, our heroes look to see-

      -Hela arriving at the far side of bridge.   She is seething
      with power, a vision of death.

      Having just come out of this huge battle, they are all weary
      and nursing injuries. Loki and Val are hurting worse than
      Thor.

      Hela walks towards them.   Menacing and deliberate.

      Thor, Loki, and Val step forward to protect the Asgardians.
      They huddle together.

                           THOR
                I think we should disband the
                Revengers.

                          LOKI

                lightning blast in the history of
                lightning. It did nothing.

Thor looks at the people boarding behind him.

                   THOR
         It won't end there. The longer
         Hela's on Asgard the more powerful
         she grows. She'll hunt us down.
         We need to stop her here and now.

                   VALKYRIE
         What's our move?

                   LOKI
         I'm not doing ""Get help.""

Thor sees Hela approaching. He sees the palace behind her. He
comes to a realization.

                    THOR
         Asgard's not a place, it's a
         people.
             (then)
         This was never about stopping

         Bold move, brother. Even for me.

Loki runs off, leaving Thor and Val to deal with Hela.

                      THOR
         Shall we?

                      VALKYRIE
         After you.

Thor ATTACKS. They CLASH, kicking off this monumental
confrontation. Hela manifests pitch black weapons to attack
Thor, but Thor is conjuring powerful bolts of electricity
with the same speed and ferocity.
Just as Thor is surging with newfound lightning powers,
Hela's powers seem to be enhanced as well.
The battle is relentless and fast-paced. Thor is holding his
own against Hela. Maybe they can win this thing.
After several fearsome exchanges, Hela PUNCTURES his shoulder
and then DARTS past him with startling speed.

       Thor continues FIGHTING Hela while Valkyrie BLOCKS Hela's

       Hela isn't landing any fatal blows, but she's carving Thor up
       and making steady progress towards the Ark.

       However, the Asgardian refugees finally make it aboard. An
       injured Heimdall, Korg, and Miek are the last to get on.

       Thor and Heimdall make eye contact.    Thor calls out:

                 GO!   GO NOW!

       As the Ark's engines begin to POWER UP-

       -Hela HARPOONS Thor.    He goes down, grimacing in pain.

       Hela begins to CONJURE AN ENORMOUS MANIFESTATION OF HER

      The first wave of Butchers arrives on board, heading straight
      for a cowering family. Just as they're about to be killed--

      POW! POW! POW!    The Butchers fall dead.

      Everyone turns to see SKURGE, now uncloaked, wielding his two
      M-16s from Texas.

                          SKURGE
                For Asgard.

      Skurge runs forward, LEAPS off the Ark, and LANDS on the
      bridge right where all the Butchers are coming to life.
      BLASTING AWAY the Butchers before they can get aboard.

      Behind Skurge, the Ark begins to LIFT OFF.

      Hela turns to see Skurge blasting his way through her
      Butchers, trying to make his way to her.

      Hela has Val in her clutches, but her focus is on the

      escape. She's furious, about to unleash hell when-

                           THOR (O.S.)
                HELA!   Enough!

      Hela turns to see Thor, having yanked out the harpoon...

      ...and it looks like he's laying down his sword!

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                You want Asgard? It's yours.

                won't work. You can't defeat me.

                No, but he can.

      KA-BOOM! EXPLODING through the roof of the palace is SURTUR!

      This is a different Surtur than the opening. He is slowly
      but steadily GROWING in size, and he carries with him a
      massive flaming sword, which GROWS as well.

      Surtur's arrival literally SHAKES the bedrock of Asgard,
      causing FISSURES to spiderweb all around him, and DISLODGING
      some of the foundation on the bridge and around the palace.

      In the background the Ark continues its ascent, now high up

      Hela's attention is on Surtur as the palace COLLAPSES around
      him. So she is unprepared for-

      -SHLNK! Mustering up all her remaining strength, Val DRIVES
      Dragonfang through Hela's chest, effectively PINNING her to
      the bridge.

      Refocused on Val, Hela goes to deliver a death blow when-

      -Thor BOLTS forward!   He PULLS Val from Hela's clutches.

      Thor turns and FIRES LIGHTNING INTO DRAGONFANG, which
      DISLODGES the section of the bridge that Hela is pinned to!

      The ground beneath Hela BREAKS FREE and she goes FALLING down
      into the expanding fissure in Asgard's bedrock.

      Badly injured, Thor and Valkyrie look up to see-

               Hulk no!   Stop it you moron!!

     It's not doing much damage, but the shock of it plus Hulk's
     impact makes Surtur take a destructive step back.

     Hulk is trying to rip out one of Surtur's horns when Surtur
     reaches up and GRABS HIM with a giant fiery hand.

     Surtur HURLS Hulk away from him.   Sends him CRASHING DOWN.

     Hulk stumbles to his feet, dazed and SMOKING. After gathering
     his bearings, Hulk gets REALLY ANGRY and heads back towards
     Surtur for round two, but-

     wants to kill that thing. On the other hand...

     Hulk PICKS UP Thor and Valkyrie.   He then squats down, and-

     sky like a rocket blasting off. Their trajectory is heading
     right at the Ark as it reaches the lower orbit of Asgard.

      Thor steps out onto the main deck to see an assembly of both
      Asgardian and Sakaarian refugees awaiting their King.

      Thor looks over his people and begins to walk through the
      crowd. His subjects part, allowing him through.

      It is the antithesis of the opening coronation from the first
      THOR movie. The people aren't cheering and lauding him, but
      rather they are smiling. Humbly bowing. Grateful.

      And Thor isn't acting arrogant. Not trying to show off any
      swagger. He is stately. A contemplative and dignified king.

      At the end of the procession, Hulk, Loki, Valkyrie, and
      Heimdall stand next to the CAPTAIN'S CHAIR.

                          VALKYRIE
                Your throne.

      Pause. Reluctant acceptance. Thor sits down.

      Flanking him on opposite sides are Valkyrie and Heimdall.

      Thor turns around to see THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE staring back,
      silently awaiting word from their new King. Now feeling the

                stepped on him on the bridge, I've
                just felt so guilty I've been

      Miek WRIGGLES to life.   Korg lights up.

                 Miek, you're alive! He's alive
                 everyone! What was your question?

      Thor looks forward, taking charge of this one.

                           THOR
                 Earth it is.

      CUT TO BLACK.

      THE END.


TAG INT. THE ARK - DAY TAG

      THOR and LOKI look out the window.

                           LOKI
                 Do you really think it's a good
                 idea to go back to Earth?

                            THOR
                 Sure!   They love me there.

                           LOKI
                 Let me rephrase: Do you really
                 think it's a good idea to bring me
                 back to Earth?

      Thor smiles, getting it.    Pats Loki on the shoulder.

                           THOR
                 Probably not. But don't worry,
                 brother...I've got a feeling that
                 everything's going to work out.

      Then through the window, they see-

      -THE MASSIVE FORM OF SANCTUARY-2, THANOS' WARSHIP
      approaching.


TAG1 EXT. THE ARK - SAME TAG1

      A wider view allows us to see all of Sanctuary-2, dwarfing
      the Ark in size.




[Post-credits scene: the Grandmaster comes out of a crash-landed ship at Sakaarians]

Grandmaster: Oh. Oh. I... I just... I gotta say, I'm proud of you all. This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us! Pat... pat on the back. Pat on the back. Come on. No? Me too. 'Cause I've been a... a big part of it. Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow. So, uh, you're welcome. And, uh, it's a tie.

 Iron Man 3
 Captain America: The Winter Soldier

Odin: [voice over] Long before the birth of light there was darkness, and from that darkness, came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.
[Malekith is looking up at the Convergence]
Odin: Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.
[the Aether is shown]
Odin: The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.
[the Dark Elves and Asgardians are shown fighting]
[Kurse walks up to Malekith]
Kurse: [subtitled] Malekith! Asgard's forces are upon us.
[the Bifrost opens, and bor steps out with Asgardian reinforcements]
Malekith: Send the Kursed.
[some soldiers crush objects in their hands and become giant hulk-like creatures]
[Malekith looks up at the Convergence again]
Odin: As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...
[Malekith and Kurse walk up to the Aether]
[however, the Bifrost opens and Asgardian warriors attack Malekith, whom he kills]
[the Bifrost disappears, just as Malekith tries to get the Aether, but it is no longer there]
Odin: But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp. Without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.
[Malekith watches as his forces are slaughtered]
Malekith: [subtitled] Their deaths will mean our survival. This war is far from over.
[he and Kurse get onto his ship and escape without notice, while destroying the other ships in the process]
[the ships kill some of the Asgardians]
Odin: Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe.
Asgardian Einherjar: Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?
Bor: If only we could. But its power is too great. Bury it deep. Somewhere no one will ever find it.


[Asgard – Throne Room. Loki, in chains, is brought to Odin.]
Frigga: Loki.
Loki: Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?
Frigga: Please, don't make this worse.
Loki: Define worse.
Odin: Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.
[Frigga leaves.]
Loki: [laughs] I really don't see what all the fuss is about.
Odin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.
Loki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you.
Odin: We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.
Loki: Give or take 5000 years.
Odin: All this because Loki desires a throne.
Loki: It is my birthright.
Odin: Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.
Loki: If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them.
Odin: Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.
Loki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?
Odin: Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the nine realms and then, yes. He will be king.


[Cut to Vanaheim]
[Sif, the Warriors Three and Thor are fighting in a battle.]
Sif: I've got this completely under control!
Thor: Is that why everything is on fire?
[Sif catches an arrow that was aimed at Thor with her shield.]
Sif: You're welcome. [a Kronan arrives] All yours.
Thor: Hello. [the Kronan growls] I accept your surrender.
[The soldiers laugh. Thor swings his hammer and crushes the Kronan.]
Thor: Anyone else?
[The soldiers surrender.]
Fandral: Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.
Guard: Keep moving. Come on! Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!
Hogun: Where do we go next?
Thor: Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait.
Hogun: You have my thanks.
Thor: As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready.


[Cut to Asgard]
Odin: Is Vanaheim secure?
Thor: As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.
Odin: You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.
Thor: That was not my intent.
Odin: For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.
Thor: Thank you.
Odin: Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.
Thor: This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.
Odin: Human lives are fleeting, they are nothing. You'd be better served by what lies in front of you [Camera briefly turns to Sif] I'm telling you this not as the all-father but as your father. You are ready. The time has come for you to take the throne. Embrace and celebrate what you've won. Join your warriors. Eat and drink, revel in their celebration. At least pretend to enjoy yourself.
[and as they celebrate, as he watches the others enjoying themselves it's obvious his heart is not in it, he walks over to the balcony to join Sif]
Sif: There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.
Thor: I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second.
Sif: Well, the first was so much fun.
[they both smile]
Sif: Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.
Thor: No, this is one I set myself.
Sif: It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.
Thor: I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.
[he turns and walks off]
[in London Jane is on a date with a man named Richard, Jane is looking at her menu feeling awkward when Richard slides a napkin in front of her with the word 'Hi' written on it]
Richard: Hi.
Jane Foster: Hi.
Richard: So what's the story with you?
Jane Foster: Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.
Richard: You've spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it. It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane. I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?
Jane Foster: It's complicated.
Richard: Is he still around?
Jane Foster: No, he...went away.
Richard: I've been there. The going away, it's hard. I'd been seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York, eventually the distance killed it. And...and the fact that she uh...she kept sleeping with other dudes.
Jane Foster: No!
Richard: Oh, so many.
[Darcy walks up to Jane and Richard's table]
Richard: Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?
Darcy Lewis: Sure, I'd love some.
Jane Foster: Richard, this is Darcy. [to Darcy] What are you doing here?
[Darcy grabs a chair from the opposite table and drags it across to their table]
Richard: Oh, hello.
[Darcy sits next to Jane and helps herself to a piece of bread and starts buttering it]
Darcy Lewis: So, I show up to work at the lab-slash-your mom's house, fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas eating ice cream obsessing about you know who...
Richard: Ah.
Darcy Lewis: But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes, you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.
Jane Foster: Is there a point to all this, cause there really has to be a point to all this.
Darcy Lewis: Right. You know that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore? You might wanna start looking at it now
[she gives Jane the gadget]
Darcy Lewis: This is the reason we came all the way out here.
Jane Foster: It's malfunctioning.
Darcy Lewis: That's what I said.
[Jane starts hitting the gadget on the table]
Darcy Lewis: That's what I did! But you just hit a little more scientific.
Jane Foster: I'm sure it's nothing.
Richard: Yeah.
[Jane hands the gadget back to Darcy]
Darcy Lewis: It didn't look like nothing. Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about. [to Richard] Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.
Jane Foster: He's not interested. I'm not interested. Time for you to go now.
Darcy Lewis: Okay.
[Jane rises and drags her chair back to where she got it from, then turns and walks off]
Richard: Short but sweet.
Jane Foster: She needs help.
[they start looking at their menus again, but Jane looks distracted by what Darcy told her]
Richard: I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.
Jane Foster: Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.
[to herself as she thinks about what Darcy showed her]
Jane Foster: Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...
Richard: Jane, maybe you should stop saying sea bass and go out to your friend.
[Jane looks at him awkwardly]
Jane Foster: This was so fun.
Richard: You know, I'll just stay here and say sea bass alone.
[Jane enters Darcy's car parked outside the restaurant]
Jane Foster: And I hate you.
Darcy Lewis: What?! I thought he was cute.
Jane Foster: Just shut up and drive.
[Darcy pulls out and drive off, as they are driving through London suddenly Jane's is shocked to see a guy sat in the back seat]
Jane Foster: Who's he?
Darcy Lewis: He's my intern.
Jane Foster: You have an intern?
Darcy Lewis: Oh, yeah.
Ian Boothby: Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh...it's a great honor to be working with you.
Jane Foster: Right. I have to call Erik.
[to Darcy as he checks the navigator]
Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...take a right.
[Darcy quickly makes a sharp turn]
Ian Boothby: Left!
[she then turns quickly left]
Darcy Lewis: I have totally mastered driving in London.
[Jane calls Erik and leaves a message]
Jane Foster: Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you? I came here because you said you were onto something and then vanished.
[a news report is then shown where Selvig is naked and running around Stonehenge while the police try to catch him]
Stonehenge TV News Reporter: I'm here at Stonehenge, for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today. The police reported the scene shortly after 11 a.m. this morning, after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then started to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment while shouting that he was trying to save them. The man later identified as noted Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.
[Darcy pulls up outside an old abandoned factory and they all get out of the car]
Darcy Lewis: Come on, this is exciting! Look, the intern is excited.
Ian Boothby: Ian.
Darcy Lewis: Do you want the phase meter?
Jane Foster: No.
Darcy Lewis: [to Ian] Bring the phase meter.
[she throws the car keys at Ian and starts walking off]
Darcy Lewis: The toaster looking thing.
Ian Boothby: I know what the phase meter is.
[as Jane walks towards the factory Darcy calls her on her cell phone which starts playing an annoying music tone]
Jane Foster: How do I change the ring tone on this thing?
Darcy Lewis: An Astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ring tone.
[Jane turns to look at Darcy]
Jane Foster: Why are you calling me?
Darcy Lewis: I didn't want to shout. [to Ian, who's following behind her] Intern, the entrance is this way.
Ian Boothby: Ian. My name's Ian.
[as they enter the old factory they hear a noise]
Darcy Lewis: I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.
[she holds up her hands and shouts]
Darcy Lewis: It's okay, we're Americans!
Jane Foster: Is that supposed to make them like us?
[suddenly the hear some kids voices]
Maddie: Make it go away...
Navid: Ssh!
[three kids come out of their hiding place]
Jane Foster: Oh, they're kids.
Maddie: Are you the police?
Jane Foster: No, we're scientists. Well, I am.
Darcy Lewis: Thanks.
Navid: We just found it.
Jane Foster: Can you show us?
[the three kids lead Jane, Darcy and Ian to a truck, one of the boys touches the truck and pushes it up with two fingers, they watch in amazement as the truck floats in mid-air]
Darcy Lewis: That doesn't seem rigged.
[the kids then take them to a stairwell in the factory, one of them drops a bottle down and they watch as the bottle disappears into thin air]
Darcy Lewis: Where did it go?
[the girl points her finger up, they look up to see the bottle reappear above them and continuously fall and disappear in the same spots in the air]
Darcy Lewis: That's...that's incredible.
[Jane picks up an empty can and drops it down and it does the same thing, it disappears into thin air, but when they look up to watch it reappear nothing happens]
Darcy Lewis: What happened?
Maddie: Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.
Darcy Lewis: I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.
[Jane picks up her gadget to look at the readings]
Jane Foster: I haven't seen readings like this since...
Darcy Lewis: New Mexico?
[Jane give Darcy a meaningful look before rushing off]
Jane Foster: Don't touch anything!
Darcy Lewis: [to Ian] Give me your shoe.
[Jane walks away from the others and watches them on the stairwell dropping objects down and watching them disappear and reappear, she sees looks at her gadget and sees the anomaly is nearby and starts walking off; back on the stairwell, Ian drops the car keys down and they watch it disappear but when they look up it doesn't reappear]
Darcy Lewis: Where those the car keys?
[Jane follows the readings on her gadget which takes her to another part of the factory, as the readings get stronger a gust of wind pushes her forward and she finds herself teleported in another realm]
Jane Foster: Darcy!
[she looks around and finds the column holding the Aether, she reaches her hand out and suddenly the Aether enters her body and she passes out; at the same time we see Malekith being awakened in his ship, knowing that the Aether has been found]
Malekith: [subtitled] The Aether awakens us. The Convergence returns.
[back in Asgard, Thor walks up the bridge towards Heimdall]
Heimdall: You're late.
Thor: Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.
Heimdall: Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.
[Thor chuckles]
Thor: Perhaps. How fare the stars?
Heimdall: Still shining. From here I can see Nine Realms and ten trillion souls.
[Heimdall looks at Thor for a moment]
Heimdall: You recall what I told you of the Convergence?
Thor: Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?
Heimdall: The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.
[they looks out into the stars]
Thor: I see nothing.
Heimdall: Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.
[Thor laughs]
Thor: How is she?
Heimdall: She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...
[Heimdall stops as he senses something]
Thor: What?
Heimdall: I can't see her.
[we see Jane being infected by the Aether] [after Jane is infected with the Aether she reawakens in the factory, she runs out to find Darcy has called the police]
Darcy Lewis: Jane! Where the hell were you?
Jane Foster: Tell me you didn't call the police!
Darcy Lewis: What was I supposed to do?
Jane Foster: Not call the police!
Darcy Lewis: I was freaking out.
Jane Foster: You call the cops they tell the feds, the next thing you know we have SHIELD crawling all over area fifty-one-ing the place.
Darcy Lewis: Jane!
Jane Foster: We had a stable gratification anomaly, we had unheeded access. Our only competition was ten years old!
Darcy Lewis: Jane, you were gone for five hours!
Jane Foster: What? [suddenly the weather turns, it starts raining and they hear the sound of thunder, Jane looks around her and puts her hand out]
Darcy Lewis: That's weird. [they see it's raining but it's not raining on Jane and Darcy, there's an invisible barrier protecting them, suddenly Jane sees Thor standing a few feet away from them, Jane hands her gadget to Darcy and walks towards Thor, as she walks away the invisible barrier follows her and the rain starts falling on Darcy] Typical. [as Jane walks towards Thor]
Thor: Jane. [as she reaches him suddenly she slaps him hard in the face]
Jane Foster: Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.
Thor: Well, I am. Jane... [suddenly she slaps him again]
Jane Foster: Where were you?!
Thor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.
Jane Foster: I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back
Thor: I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.
Jane Foster: As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!
Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool. [Thor places his hand Jane's face] I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.
Jane Foster: What?
Thor: I know...
Jane Foster: You do?
Thor: Do what? [they lean in close and just as they are about to kiss Darcy interrupts them; referring to the rain]
Jane Foster: Hey! Is that you? [Thor looks up and the rain stops]
Jane Foster: Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.
Darcy Lewis: Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.
Jane Foster: [to Thor] Hold that thought. [she turns and runs towards the police]
Darcy Lewis: Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?
Thor: Space is fine. [Jane walks over to the police]
Jane Foster: Excuse me?
Police Officer #1: Are you Jane Foster?
Jane Foster: Yes.
Police Officer #1: [referring to Ian] Do you know this man?
Jane Foster: He's my intern. My intern's intern.
Police Officer #1: This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me. [the police officer goes t grab Jane's arm but suddenly the force from the Aether creates a powerful force which pushes the officer and everything else away, Thor runs towards Jane who's lying on the ground]
Thor: Jane! Jane? [he helps her stand] You alright?
Jane Foster: What just happened? [the other police officer approaches Jane apprehensively]
Police Officer #2: Place your hands on your head, step back!
Thor: The woman is unwell.
Police Officer #2: She's dangerous.
Thor: So am I. [talking into his radio]
Police Officer #2: Requesting armed response officers to the scene. [Thor grabs Jane and pulls her closer to him]
Thor: Hold on to me.
Jane Foster: What are you doing? [suddenly the Bifrost opens and Thor takes Jane to Asgard; Darcy looks up as they disappear]
Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [Thor and Jane travel through the Bifrost and enter Asgard where Heimdall is guarding as always, Jane looks around her in amazement]
Jane Foster: We have to do that again. [she notices Heimdall for the first time] Hi.
Heimdall: Welcome to Asgard. [returning to their homeland, Svartalfheim, Malekith kneels and grabs a handful of dust from the ground]
Malekith: [subtitled] Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light. [Algrim places his hand on Malekith's shoulder]
Algrim: [subtitled] Our survival will be your legacy.
Malekith: [subtitled] The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world. [as the Asgardian physicians study Jane and the force within her]
Jane Foster: What's that?
Eir: Be still. [Thor watches with one of the nurses as they examine Jane]
Thor: This is not of Earth, what is it?
Asgardian Nurse: We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her. [the nurse turns and walks away as Thor looks at Jane with worry]
Jane Foster: That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?
Eir: It's a Soul Forge.
Jane Foster: Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another? [Eir looks impressed]
Eir: Yes. [Jane looks at Thor and whispers]
Jane Foster: It's a quantum field generator. [Thor smiles at her] [Odin enters the room as the Thor looks on to Jane as she is being examined]
Odin: My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?
Thor: She's ill.
Odin: She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.
Thor: I brought here because we can help her.
Odin: She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table. [Jane sits up and looks at Thor]
Jane Foster: Did he just...? [to Odin] Who do you think you are?
Odin: I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.
Jane Foster: Oh. Well, I'm...
Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster. [Jane turns to look at Thor]
Jane Foster: You told your Dad about me?
Thor: Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.
Odin: Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard. [as two guards approach Jane and go to grab her, suddenly the energy force within her sets off again throwing the two guards aside]
Thor: Don't touch her. [he leans down and tenderly touches Jane] Jane, are you alright? [Jane nods her head, Odin inspects the energy force running through Jane's body and realizes it's the Aether]
Odin: That's impossible.
Eir: The infection, it's defending her.
Thor: No, it's defending itself.
Odin: Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. [Odin shows Thor and Jane an ancient book] But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.
Thor: [reading from the book] ""Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light."" They were these stories mother told us as children.
Odin: Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.
Jane Foster: What happened?
Odin: He killed them all.
Thor: Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.
Odin: The Dark Elves are dead.
Jane Foster: Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?
Odin: No, it does not. [back on Svartalfheim, in his ship Malekith plots his vengeance against the Asgardians]
Malekith: [subtitled] The Realms will be aligned soon. [Malekith takes out a knife and turns to Algrim]
Malekith: [subtitled] You'll be the last of the Kursed. [Malekith stabs Algrim in the stomach with his knife]
Algrim: [subtitled] Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.
Malekith: [subtitled] You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you. [one of the dark elves places a molten rock in Malekith's hand and Malekith places it inside Algrim's stomach] And then no power of our enemies will stop me.
Algrim: [subtitled] I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe. [Malekith looks to one of his dark elves as he carries a mask] [Fandral and Volstagg return to Asgard with several prisoners, including the masked Algrim; Loki watches them from his cell as they come in]
Loki: Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.
Frigga: The books I sent, do they not interest you? [Loki turns and we see Frigga is in Loki's cell]
Loki: Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?
Frigga: I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.
Loki: Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.
Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.
Loki: My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.
Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?
Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.
Frigga: Your father...
Loki: [shouts] He's not my father!
Frigga: Then am I not your mother? [Loki hesitates for a moment]
Loki: You're not. [Frigga smiles at him with tears in her eyes]
Frigga: Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [she takes a step towards him and extends her hands, Loki goes to touch her hand but his hand goes through hers and we see that she's a hologram, Loki looks at Frigga with sadness and her hologram disappears] [Jane and Thor walk in Asgard]
Jane Foster: When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.
Thor: Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.
Jane Foster: Well, how's that possible?
Thor: I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. [he takes her hand and he shows her by touching his palm to hers] During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost. [he leans closer and they kiss]
Jane Foster: I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?
Thor: I'll find a way to save you, Jane.
Jane Foster: Your father said there was...
Thor: My father doesn't know everything. [suddenly they are interrupted by Frigga]
Frigga: Don't let him hear you say that.
Thor: Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother. [Jane looking embarrassed quickly removes her hand from Thor's mother, Frigga]
Jane Foster: Hi. [in his cell, Algrim pulls out the rock that Malekith had placed in his stomach, he crushes it in his hand, transforming himself into a Kursed, he breaks free and releases the other prisoners, Loki watches all this from his cell, then Algrim walks up to Loki's cell and he look at Loki for a moment before turning and walking away]
Loki: You might want to take the stairs to the left. [Algrim turns and looks at Loki before walking away again; outside they hear the prison alarm going off]
Frigga: The prisons.
Thor: Loki.
Frigga: [referring to Jane] Go, I will look after her. [Thor takes off with his hammer; in the prison Volstagg and Fandral enter the fight with the prisoners]
Fandral: It's as if they resent being imprisoned.
Volstagg: There's no pleasing some creatures. [as they continue to fight, Loki is sat calmly in his cell reading, suddenly Thor enters and everyone turns to look at him]
Thor: Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. [suddenly one of the prisoners punches him in the face] Very well, you don't have my word. [Thor punches him back and starts fighting with the other prisoners]
Odin: [to his guards] Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.
Frigga: Odin.
Odin: Frigga. [to the Asgardian guards] Go! [to Frigga and Jane] It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.
Frigga: You've never been a very good liar. [at that moment Jane notices Sif as she walks past them]
Odin: Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.
Frigga: You take care.
Odin: Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.
Frigga: It's only because I worry over you that you have survived. [Odin goes off, Frigga leads Jane away, she takes a sword from one of the guards] Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.
Jane Foster: Yes, ma'am. [as Heimdall is stood in his usual guarding post, he suddenly hears something turns and runs out onto the Bifrost Bridge, he jumps onto one of Malekith's ships cloaked in invisibility, making it visible and manages to send it crashing into the sea, but he soon finds that a giant ship is behind him releasing smaller ships to attack Asgard, Heimdall activates a shield to protect Asgard but Algrim manages to deactivate it sending a ship to crash into the palace] [after Malekith's ship has crashed into the palace the Dark Elves start attacking the Asgardian soldiers killing them all, Malekith leaves the ship and goes to look for Frigga and Jane after which Odin arrives to find all the soldiers killed]
Odin: Frigga. [Malekith finds the tower where Frigga is hiding Jane and enters the room]
Frigga: Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.
Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.
Frigga: Who are you?
Malekith: I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine. [as he walks closer to Frigga she strikes him in the face with her sword, he takes out his blade and starts fighting with Frigga, she puts up a good fight but Algrim comes to his aid and subdues her, Malekith walks towards Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith stands in front of Jane and as he goes to grab her she disappears and he realizes that she's a hologram, he turns to Frigga] Witch! Where is the Aether?
Frigga: I'll never tell.
Malekith: I believe you. [suddenly Algrim stabs Frigga in the back, at the same time Thor rushes in and shoots a lightning bolt at Malekith's face, severely scarring it, he and Algrim escape and jump onto their ship before Thor can catch them; after Malekith and Algrim escape Odin arrives to find Frigga dead, he holds her body in his arms as Thor and Jane look on, a funeral is held for Frigga where all the Asgardians mourn her as her body is pushed out to the sea on a boat and the boat burnt by a flaming arrow, at the same time Loki expresses his grief in his cell] [back on Earth Erik has been institutionalized and is trying to explain the convergence to the patients in his ward]
Erik Selvig: The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align. [he picks up a shoe and holds it up] Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and... [one of the patients hands him another shoe] Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other. [he demonstrates with the shoes by smacking one on top of the other repeatedly] But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic. [he then puts the shoes down and picks up two pencils and holds them up] My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence. [he puts the pencil down and picks up the shoes again] This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions? [we see the patients in the ward just carrying on with their activity, no one has really taken any notice of him, then one of the patients (Stan Lee) interrupts]
Patient: Yeah. Can I have my shoe back? [on their ship; to Malekith]
Algrim: [subtitled] I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.[in Asgard, Jane is sat in her room when suddenly the power of the Aether surrounds her and everything around her turns red for a moment, then Volstagg enters the room with two guards]
Einherjar Lieutenant: Jane Foster. You need to come with us. [Fandral and Odin inspect the damage to the palace where Malekith had crashed his ship]
Fandral: We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless. [Thor approaches them]
Thor: She's your prisoner now? [to Fandral, Volstagg and the guards] Leave us. [they all start walking off and leave Thor with Odin]
Odin: I do not wish to fight with you.
Thor: Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.
Odin: We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.
Thor: Yes, and you will destroy us.
Odin: You overestimate the power of these creatures.
Thor: No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.
Odin: If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.
Thor: The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.
Odin: If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.
Thor: And how of our men shall fall on theirs?
Odin: As many as are needed! [there's a moment pause] We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.
Thor: And how are you different from Malekith? [Odin chuckles]
Odin: The difference, my son, is that I will win. [Odin turns and walks off] [back on Earth, Darcy paces around her apartment as Ian is sat watching the news on TV]
Darcy Lewis: Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!
Ian Boothby: What's SHIELD?
Darcy Lewis: It's a secret. [Darcy leaves a voice message for Erik] Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. [as Ian is watching the news they start reporting about Erik being arrested at Stonehenge]
News Reporter: Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.
Ian Boothby: Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again? [Darcy looks at the news report on TV]
News Reporter: ...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm... [Ian presses the pause button on Erik's face from footage taken at Stonehenge, Darcy sits in dismay as she looks at Erik's face on the TV] [in Asgard, Thor is sat alone when Heimdall walks up to him]
Thor: You're not in Odin's war council?
Heimdall: The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. [Heimdall takes off his helmet and places it on the table] We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that? [he sits down looking defeated]
Thor: Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.

Heimdall: I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.

Thor: I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.
Heimdall: As are we all.
Thor: Well I see clearly enough.
Heimdall: The risks are too great.
Thor: Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way. [Heimdall hesitates before replying]
Heimdall: What do you require of me?
Thor: What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. [we see Thor holding a meeting with Sif, Fandral, Volstagg and Heimdall] We must move Jane off world.
Sif: The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.
Heimdall: There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.
Thor: One, actually. [the others suddenly realize he means Loki]
Volstagg: No. [Thor walks up to Loki's cell where he is standing looking well kept and clean]
Loki: Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?
Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [suddenly Loki's cell is transformed, the illusion is lifted and we see that Loki's cell is a mess, everything has been thrown around and he's sat on the floor, looking unkempt and messy, in the other corner of the cell]
Loki: Now you see me, brother. [Thor walks up to the other side of the cell to be closer to Loki] Did she suffer?
Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.
Loki: Go on.
Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell. [Loki chuckles]
Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?
Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you. [Loki smiles]
Loki: Hmm. When do we start? [back to the meeting with Thor and his comrades]
Fandral: He will betray you.
Thor: He will try. [Loki and Thor walk out of the Asgardian prison]
Loki: This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?
Thor: If you keep speaking I just might.
Loki: Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. [using his diversion tactics Loki turns himself into an Asgardian guard] Is this better?
Thor It's better company at least.
Loki: Still, we could be less conspicuous. [Loki turns back into himself but turns Thor into Sif] Hm, brother. You look ravishing. [Thor looks down at his body then replies in his own voice]
Thor: It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.
Loki: Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much. [Loki then turns himself into Captain America in his full Captain America costume] Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer– [suddenly Thor grabs hold of Loki puts his hand over his mouth and pushes him against the wall making Loki turn back into himself] What? [Thor looks to the side and they see two Asgardian guards walking away] You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something! [Thor looks at him and we hear a noise like a sword being drawn] At last, a little common sense. [Loki then looks down then holds up his hands which now have iron handcuffs on them]
Thor: And I thought you liked tricks. [Thor laughs and turns to walk off] [back at the original meeting Thor was holding with his comrades]
Fandral: Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.
Thor: I won't be the one who comes for her. [Thor looks over to Sif; then we see Jane is sat in her guarded room when one of the guards enters]
Jane Foster: I'm not hungry. [suddenly Sif comes up behind the guard and knocks him out, she looks over to Jane]
Sif: Good, let's go. [Jane and Sif meet up with Thor with Loki standing beside him, Jane points to Loki]
Jane Foster: You're...
Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard of... [suddenly Jane slaps Loki hard in the face]
Jane Foster: That was for New York. [Loki smiles and looks at Thor]
Loki: I like her. [back at Thor's meeting with his comrades]
Sif: And what of the All-Father?
Heimdall: It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne. [Odin visits Heimdall accompanied by some of his guards]
Odin: You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?
Heimdall: Treason, my lord.
Odin: Whose?
Heimdall: Mine. [Heimdall draws his sword, at the same time more guards interrupt them]
Einherjar Lieutenant: My King, the mortal has been taken. [Odin looks at Heimdall as he commands his guards]
Odin: Stop Thor, by any means necessary. [as they hear the guards approaching]
Guards: There they are! Take them. On my command.
Sif: I'll hold them off. Take her.
Thor: Thank you. [Thor and Jane go off, as Loki goes to follow them Sif draws her sword and places it under Loki's throat]
Sif: Betray him and I'll kill you. [Loki chuckles]
Loki: It's good to see you too, Sif. [Loki leaves to join Thor and Jane as the guards get closer to Sif; back at the original meeting with Thor and his comrades]
Volstagg: Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.
Thor: That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot. [Thor, Loki and Jane meet Volstagg where Malekith's ship had crashed into the palace]
Volstagg: I will give you as much time as I can.

[Thor and Volstagg do a forearm shake]

Thor: Thank you, my friend. [as they walk towards Malekith's crashed ship, Jane smiles and nods at Volstagg, then as Loki is about to follow Thor and Jane Volstagg stops him]
Volstagg: If you even think about betraying him...
Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. [Volstagg then lets him pass] [Thor, Jane and Loki board Malekith's crashed ship, Thor looks at the controls and starts pressing some button, looking unsure of what he's doing] I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.
Thor: I said, ""how hard could it be?"" [meanwhile, the Asgardian guards rush towards the ship with Volstagg standing guard in front of it]
Guard: They're on the ship!
Loki: They're on the ship! [as they approach the ship Volstagg starts attacking them; back in the ship] Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.
Thor: Shut up, Loki. [outside the ship Volstagg continues to battle with the Asgardian guards; back in the ship Thor continues to frantically press every button to start the ship]
Loki: You must have missed something.
Thor: No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.
Loki: No, don't hit it, just press it gently. [as he hits the buttons]
Thor: I am pressing it gently. It's not working! [suddenly the ship comes to life, Thor laughs; outside the ship Volstagg is overrun by the guards.]
Guards: Get him! Get him!
[Volstagg starts laughing as they watch the ship start to rise, hitting the columns of the palace]
Loki: I think you missed a column.
Thor: Shut up! [finally the ship breaks through the palace walls and takes off] [as they are flying through Asgard]
Loki: Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.
Thor: Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly? [as they are flying over Asgard suddenly Jane collapses]
Loki: Oh, dear. Is she dead?
Thor: Jane. [Jane raises her head, looking weak]
Jane Foster: I'm okay. [as they continue to fly, the ship hits and breaks off a part of a massive building; to Loki]
Thor: Not a word. [several smaller Asgardian ships start following them]
Loki: Now they're following us. [the smaller ships start firing at them] Now they're firing at us!
Thor: Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting! [the ship then hits a massive stone monument of King Bor, breaking the head off]
Loki: Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. [the smaller ships continue to follow and fire at them as they fly over Asgard] You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant! [suddenly Thor pushes Loki off the ship, Thor then picks up Jane and jumps off the flying ship and lands onto a smaller ship being flown by Fandral, Loki has also fallen onto the ship]
Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki. [the Asgardian ships above them continue to follow and fire at Malekith's ship as they think that Thor is still on there] [Thor lays Jane down]
Loki: You lied to me. I'm impressed.
Thor: I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. [Loki smiles and takes over the ship's control, at the same time the Asgardian ships spot them and start firing at them] Fandral.
Fandral: Right. [Fandral picks up a rope and steps on to the edge of the ship] For Asgard. [suddenly he jumps off the ship and uses the rope to swing onto the Asgardian ship following them] Nothing personal, boys! [he knocks out the three guards on the ship then looks over to Thor and salutes him; on Fandral's ship Loki flies them towards the mountains]
Thor: Loki!
Loki: If it were easy everyone would do it.
Thor: Are you mad?
Loki: Possibly. [Thor holds on to Jane, as Loki heads straight for the wall of the mountain, suddenly they enter right through the mountain and then enter through a portal to Svartalfheim] Ta-da! [on their ship, Algrim approaches Malekith]
Algrim: [subtitled] We must attack now.
Malekith: [subtitled] No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home. [as they fly over Svartalfheim, Jane continues to lie down and Thor puts a cover over her]
Loki: [sighs] What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.
Thor: It would consume you.
Loki: She's holding up alright, for now.
Thor: She's strong in ways you'd never even know.
Loki: Say goodbye.
Thor: Not this day.
Loki: This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.
Thor: And will that satisfy you?
Loki: Satisfaction is not in my nature.
Thor: Surrender not in mine.
Loki: The son of Odin.
Thor: No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!
Loki: Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!
Thor: What help were you in your cell?
Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?! [Thor grabs hold of Loki]
Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [Thor raises his fist to punch Loki but stops himself] She wouldn't want us to fight.
Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked. [they both smile]
Thor: I wish I could trust you. [Thor turns his back to Loki]
Loki: Trust my rage. [back on Earth, Darcy and Ian go to free Erik from the mental institution]
Desk Officer: You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig. [Ian looks distracted and Darcy nudges him to bring him to attention]
Ian Boothby: What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig. [Ian goes to sign the form]
Desk Officer: One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine. [he places the, wallet, key ring with the keys and a plastic bag containing medicine bottles on the counter] Various. [the officer then bends to pick up another item from behind the counter, at the same time Darcy notices Erik being escorted towards them]
Darcy Lewis: Erik.
Desk Officer: And... [the officer places Erik's gadgets on the counter] These.
Ian Boothby: Yeah, those. Thank goodness. [as Erik comes towards Darcy]
Darcy Lewis: Erik.
Erik Selvig: Yes?
Darcy Lewis: It's uh...Darcy.
Erik Selvig: Darcy. [Darcy holds up her hands and smiles, Erik then hugs her] It's so good to see you.
Darcy Lewis: Uh...I missed you too. [Darcy looks awkward as Erik continues to hold her tightly]
Erik Selvig: How did you find me?
Ian Boothby: You were naked on TV.
Darcy Lewis: Okay, time to go. Lots to do. [Erik continues to hold her] Getting weird now. [as they walk down the corridor of the mental institution with Ian holding Erik's gadgets] I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period. [Erik takes his bag of medicine from Ian]
Ian Boothby: I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either. [Ian watches as Erik takes out a bottle of pills] Are you alright?
Erik Selvig: I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it. [as they step out of the building suddenly the gadget in Ian arms starts to beep]
Ian Boothby: Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.
Erik Selvig: It's happening, sooner than I calculated.
Darcy Lewis: Wait, what's happening? [they look up to see flock of birds flying above them] Birds? Birds are happening?
Ian Boothby: They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.
Darcy Lewis: Erik?
Erik Selvig: Look. [suddenly the birds all fly in the same direction and they all suddenly disappear]
Darcy Lewis: Where did they go? [suddenly all the birds appear behind, them flying away frantically making Darcy screams in terror] What the hell was that?! [Erik smiles] Why are you smiling?
Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. [he walks ahead and throws his bag of medicine into the garbage bin nearby] Take me to Jane's lab! [on Svartalfheim, as they continue flying on their ship suddenly Jane's eyes open, it's clear that the Aether has taken her over, she rises and looks ahead]
Thor: Jane.
Jane Foster: Malekith. [after landing their ship, they walk over to watch Malekith and his men in the distance]
Thor: Alright, are you ready? [Jane nods her head]
Loki: I am. [they rise from their hiding spot and Malekith spots them standing on a hill in the distance] You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.
Thor: Yeah, possibly. [Loki holds up his shackled hands for Thor to uncuff him]
Loki: You still don't trust me, brother?
Thor: Would you? [Thor takes off Loki's cuffs]
Loki: No, I wouldn't. [suddenly Loki takes out a dagger stabs Thor and throws him down the hill]
Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Malekith sees this and starts walking towards them] [after stabbing Thor and throwing him down the hill, Loki walks over to Thor]
Loki: You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? [he kicks Thor in the stomach] All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! [Thor raises his hand, attempting to summon Mjolnir, but Loki cuts off his hand making Thor scream out in pain, Jane rushes over to Thor but Loki grabs her and turns to face Malekith and his dark elves] Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! [he throws Jane at Malekith's feet] I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.
Algrim: [to Malekith] [subtitled] He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell. [Malekith walks over to Thor squirming in pain on the ground]
Malekith: Look at me. [Malekith uses his foot to turn Thor, he then lifts Jane in the air and extracts the Aether from her, in that moment Jane has a vision of Earth, then as the Aether leaves her body Jane falls to the ground]
Thor: Loki, now! [Loki uses his diversion tactics and we see that he had never amputated Thor's hand, Thor quickly summons Mjolnir and shoots lightning at the Aether attempting to destroy it, but he fails as Malekith is still able to absorb it and turns to leave on his ship] [two of the dark elves start attacking Thor but he quickly takes them down, Algrim then throws one of his vortex weapons in the air, Loki pushes Jane away and he is nearly sucked in when Thor pulls him out, Thor then attacks Algrim but he beats Thor down, Loki goes over to them and impales Algrim from behind, Algrim slowly turns and suddenly pulls Loki into the blade that is sticking out from him] No! [Algrim takes a step towards Loki]
Loki: See you in hell, monster! [Algrim then realizes that attached to the blade in him is his own vortex weapon, it explodes before he can do anything destroying him; Thor then rushes over to Loki]
Thor: No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!
Loki: I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool! [Loki squirms in pain]
Thor: Stay with me, okay?
Loki: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thor: Shh.
Loki: I'm sorry.
Thor: It's okay. [Thor nods his head] It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.
Loki: I didn't do it for him. [he closes his eyes and as he dies his skin turns to it's blue Frost Giant form, Thor cries out in anguish]
Thor: No! [Thor looks at Jane as he weeps for Loki] [after Loki's death, Thor and Jane enter a cave as they see a storm approaching]
Jane Foster: He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.
Thor: How? Jane, how?
Jane Foster: I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?
Thor: The Convergence.
Jane Foster: Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.
Thor: Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.
Jane Foster: I only found it because I was looking for you.
Thor: Jane. [he places his hand on her face]
Jane Foster: Now we're trapped here. [suddenly they hear music playing, Jane and Thor look at each other in confusion]
Thor: It's not me. [Jane realizes it's her cell phone, she takes it out of her pocket and answers it]
Jane Foster: Hello?
Richard: Hi, Jane, it's Richard.
Jane Foster: Richard?! Where are you?
Richard: I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today. [Jane puts him on speaker and holds up her phone]
Jane Foster: Oh, my God! This is amazing.
Richard: Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.
Jane Foster: How am I getting service here?
Richard: Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?
Jane Foster: No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.
Richard: Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.
Jane Foster: Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?
Richard: Yeah, I will. [Jane looks down and notices can and keys that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]
Jane Foster: Oh, my God. [Jane picks up the keys from the floor of the cave]
Richard: Am I interrupting something.
Jane Foster: No, no, no, nothing at all. [realizing how they can return to Earth, Jane turns to Thor] Come on.
Richard: I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel? [Thor starts following Jane]
Thor: Where are we going?
Richard: [to Jane] Hello? [they start walking further into the cave, Thor notices the discarded shoes that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]
Thor: Why are there so many shoes in here? [as they walks further in suddenly they disappear; back in his office Richard loses Jane on the phone]
Richard: I'll just text her. [Jane and Thor appear back on Earth outside the factory, they get into Ian's abandoned car still parked outside the factory and Jane tries to start the car]
Darcy Lewis: Jane!
Jane Foster: Hey.
Darcy Lewis: You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy! [Thor hangs his hammer on the coat hanger next to the door] All the stuff we saw is spreading. [she looks at Jane's Asgardian clothes and disheveled state] Did you go to a party? [Jane notices Erik for the first time]
Jane Foster: Erik?!
Erik Selvig: Jane, how wonderful! [he rises and goes to Jane and as he embraces her we see he isn't wearing any pants] You've been to Asgard.
Jane Foster: Where are your pants?
Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.
Jane Foster: Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.
Erik Selvig: Okay.
Thor: Are you well, Erik? [Erik chuckles then his smile fades quickly]
Erik Selvig: Your brother is not coming, is he?
Thor: Loki is dead.
Erik Selvig: Oh, thank God. [Thor looks at him in confusion] I...I'm so sorry.
Thor: Thank you. [Erik then embraces Thor] [back on Svartalfheim we see an Einherjar Guard use the ship that brought Thor, Loki and Jane onto the planet to return to Asgard, he goes to see Odin at the palace]
Einherjar Guard: Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.
Odin: Thor?
Einherjar Guard: There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but... [he takes a step closer to Odin]
Odin: What?
Einherjar Guard: We found a body. [there's a moment's pause]
Odin: Loki. [the warrior doesn't reply but just looks at Odin] [back at Jane's apartment]
Jane Foster: Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.
Erik Selvig: Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.
Thor: Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.
Darcy Lewis: Well, how do we know where that is?
Erik Selvig: We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it. [Erik places a map of the British Isles on the coffee table] All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map. [he starts drawing on the map] Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here. [he points to Greenwich on the map]
Ian Boothby: Greenwich?
Jane Foster: The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart. [Thor summons Mjolnir and it shoots over to Thor's hand from the where it was hanging on the coat hanger]
Erik Selvig: I better get my pants. [in Greenwich at the location outside a library Darcy and Ian grab Erik's gadget]
Darcy Lewis: Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.
Ian Boothby: They're taped together!
Darcy Lewis: Do you even know what these things do?
Ian Boothby: No.
Darcy Lewis: Neither do I. [Darcy and Ian start placing Erik's gadgets around the library grounds] Come on, come on!
Ian Boothby: Fine! [suddenly Malekith's giant ship appears on the River Thames near the library grounds]
Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [the ship starts moving forward and crashing through the library grounds causing pandemonium until it finally stops in the middle of the grounds, Malekith and his dark elves step off the ship and the same time Thor flies in and lands in front of Malekith]
Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.
Thor: Not by your hand!
Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished. [Malekith uses the power of the Aether to attack Thor but Thor manages to narrowly miss getting hit by it] [inside the library setting up the gravimetric device]
Erik Selvig: We're running out of time.
Jane Foster: Almost there.
Erik Selvig: Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.
Jane Foster: Oh, come on. [Jane looks out and sees Thor and Malekith battling it out] Come on, Darcy. [Jane rushes off to find Darcy; outside Thor manages to deflect the Aether that Malekith is using to fight him off]
Thor: You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder. [as Malekith is using the Aether to shield himself suddenly Thor throws his hammer at him which throws Malekith across the ground and smashes him against the library building, at the same time Jane sees Darcy and Ian placing the last of Erik's device in the ground]
Ian Boothby: Done. [Darcy gives the OK sign to Jane and Jane rushes back to Erik]
Erik Selvig: The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.
Jane Foster: That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight. [Jane gets the device ready] Okay, you might wanna hold on to something. [she turns on the device and suddenly some of the dark elves suddenly disappear; Darcy and Ian watch this nearby, Darcy talks to Jane on her phone]
Darcy Lewis: That is awesome! How did you do that?
Jane Foster: Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...
Darcy Lewis: Oh, there's a guy with a sword! [Jane uses the device again to make the dark elf disappear but instead she accidentally makes Darcy and Ian disappear]
Jane Foster: Oops.
Erik Selvig: Let's go. [Darcy and Ian appear in another part of London]
Darcy Lewis: What the hell just happened? [suddenly the dark elves that had also disappeared appear and fall onto a parked car] Move! [Darcy grabs hold of Ian's hand and they run off as the dark elves start chasing after them; back at the library Thor and Malekith continue their battle and everyone inside the library rushes to the windows to watch]
Jane Foster: What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!
Student: You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything! [he uses his phone to record the battle outside; in their ensuing fight, Thor and Malekith are transported through the realms to Svartalfheim and London continuously, at the same time a fighter jet flies towards Malekith's ship]
Control: Confirming ship is hostile.
Pilot: Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.
Control: Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way. [the pilot releases the missile] Missile off target! I repeat...
Pilot: Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control! [the jet is then transported to Valaheim] [as they run through the library ground]
Erik Selvig: What are you doing?
Jane Foster: My signal's lost connection. [some of the dark elves are behind them chasing after them]
Erik Selvig: Jane! Come on! [as Thor and Malekith continue their battle through the realms they land in Jotunheim and are confronted by a giant beast which then is transported to London, at the same time Darcy and Ian are being ambushed by the dark elves when Ian, with the help of the anti-gravitational energy force, grabs a car and throws it at them, Darcy looks at him in shock]
Ian Boothby: Are you alright?
Darcy Lewis: You saved my life.
Ian Boothby: Yeah. Yes, I did. [back at the library grounds Jane manages to make the device work again and as she uses it suddenly makes Darcy and Ian appear behind her in each others arms kissing]
Jane Foster: Darcy?
Darcy Lewis: Jane! [Darcy lets go of Ian and falls to the ground]
Erik Selvig: Ian?
Ian Boothby: Selvig! [suddenly Mjolnir appears and flies past them]
Darcy Lewis: Meowmeow! [Thor and Malekith are then transported through the realms again with Malekith landing back in Greenwich but Thor ends up in Charing Cross Underground Station]
Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.
[Thor turns to one of the passengers on the underground train that's just arrived]
Thor: How do I get to Greenwich?
Woman on Train: Take this train, three stops. [Thor steps onto the train and places his hand on the bar above him]
Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.
[as the train starts to move, the movement causes the woman to fall against Thor and she stops herself by placing her hand on his chest]
Woman on Train: Sorry. Sorry. [Thor smiles politely at her]
[in Greenwich the realms come closer to converging, Malekith readies the Aether within him to bring forth the darkness]
Jane Foster: We're out of time. [Jane rushes off ahead]
Erik Selvig: Jane. Jane! [Thor rushes out of the station to watch the Aether taking over]
Jane Foster: Thor! We're too late.
Erik Selvig: The Convergence is at its peak. [Thor looks at the gadget spears in Erik's hand]
Thor: Can those things stop him?
Erik Selvig: Not from here.
Jane Foster: We can't get close enough. [Thor looks at Jane]
Thor: I can. [Thor takes the spears from Erik and rushes off towards Malekith] [Thor pushes through the Aether and reaches Malekith] Malekith! [Malekith turns to face Thor]
Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?
Thor: I've come to accept your surrender. [Thor throws one of Erik's gadget spears at Malekith and he catches it, Jane uses the gavemetric which makes his arm disappear and we see it transported to Svartalfheim, Thor throws the other spear at Malekith and he catches it and his other arm disappears]
Malekith: You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.
Thor: But you can. [Thor summons Mjolnir at the same time he rushes towards Malekith and as he grabs his hammer he uses it to throw Malekith into his ship and Jane is able to use her device to transport him Svartalfheim] [after Thor kills Malekith Jane goes to find Thor and finds him lying on the ground, suddenly Malekith's ship starts to crumble, Jane rushes towards the unconscious Thor]
Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Jane turns Thor over grabs his arm and starts to pull him out of the way but he is too heavy, just them Erik, Darcy and Ian arrive on the scene]
Erik Selvig: Jane! [the ship starts to fall, as Jane is not able to move Thor she throws herself on top of him and holds on to him with her eyes closed, just as the ship is about to land on them it disappears and appears on Svartalfheim landing on Malekith and crushing him to death; back in Greenwich] Everybody okay? [Thor becomes conscious and opens his eyes, Darcy smiles and throws her arms around Ian and kisses him passionately] [couple of days later, Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian are in her apartment sat having breakfast quietly]
Darcy Lewis: He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.
Jane Foster: Well, it's only been two days, so...
Erik Selvig: Did he say anything before he left?
Jane Foster: Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out. [Jane looks away and carries on eating her breakfast]
Erik Selvig: Oh.

[On Asgard Thor meets with Odin at the palace]
Odin: You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?
Thor: My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.
Odin: Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?
Thor: When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice? [Odin sighs] This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.
Odin: One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?
Thor: Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [Odin nods his head, Thor then holds up Mjolnir to offer it back to Odin]
Odin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.
Thor: I shall try to be.
Odin: I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.
Thor: I know. [Thor turns to leave]
Odin: If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son. [Thor smiles]
Thor: Thank you, father. [he turns and starts walking off, as Odin watches Thor walk off Odin's form transform to reveal Loki]
Loki: No. Thank you. [Loki smiles devilishly] [mid-credits scene; Sif and Volstagg are taken to meet, The Collector Taneleer Tivan]
Collector's Assistant: I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.
The Collector: Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor. [he bows theatrically]
Sif: You know why we're here.
The Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?
Volstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.
The Collector: That's very wise. [Sif hands the Aether over to The Collector] I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.
Sif: See that it is. [The Collector bows his head, Sif and Volstagg turn and leave]
The Collector: One down, five to go. [after credits scene; at her apartment Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian hear the sounds of thunder, Jane looks out and smiles as she sees lightning, Jane walks out onto her balcony as Thor appears, they embrace and start kissing passionately; at the same time we see the beast transported from Jotunheim running amok outside the abandoned factory]


[Thor arrives to provide backup to Sif and the Warriors Three]
Sif: I've got this completely under control!
Thor: Is that why everything's on fire?
 . . .
[the marauders bring out a rock monster to battle Thor]
Sif: All yours. [steps back]
Thor: Hello. [the beast roars] I accept your surrender.
[the marauders roar with laughter; Thor uppercuts the beast with Mjolnir, reducing it to a pile of rubble]
Thor: Anyone else?


Loki: [mock salute to Odin] I really don't see what all the fuss is about…
Odin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!
Loki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.
Odin: We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.
Loki: Give or take five thousand years.
Odin: All this because Loki desires a throne...
Loki: It is my birthright!
Odin: Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.
Loki: If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.
Odin: Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.
Loki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?
Odin: Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.


Darcy: Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.
Ian: Ian, my name's Ian.
Darcy: Do you want the phase meter?
Jane: No.
Darcy: Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.
Ian: Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.


[Thor and Jane reunite]
Thor: Jane?
[she walks up to him and slaps him]
Jane Foster: Sorry. I just…needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very strange day.
Thor: I am. Jane—
[she slaps him again]
Jane: Where were you?!
Thor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.
Jane: I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.
Thor: I know. I know, but the Bifröst was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging…I had to put an end to the slaughter.
[she looks at him blankly for a moment]
Jane: As excuses go, it's not…terrible…But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!
Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.
[they embrace]


Malekith: [looking out over the ruins of Svartalfheim] Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.
Algrim: Our survival will be your legacy.
Malekith: The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.


Odin: She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!
Jane: Did he just-? Who do you think you are?
Odin: I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.
Jane: Oh. Well I'm-
Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.
Jane: [to Thor] You told your dad about me?


Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.
Loki: My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life…that I was born to be a king.
Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?
Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.
Frigga: Your father—
Loki: He's not my father!
Frigga: Then am I not your mother?
Loki: You're not.
Frigga: [looks hurt but chuckles] You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [Loki looks sorry and reaches for her but she disappears]


[Malekith bursts into Frigga's chamber, hunting for Jane]
Frigga: Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.
Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.
Frigga: Who are you?
Malekith: I am Malekith... [looks at Jane] and I would have what is mine. [They both draw swords and duel, until Algrim arrives and helps overpower Frigga. Malekith turns to confront Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith discovers Jane is an illusion and angrily faces a grinning Frigga] WITCH! Where is the Aether?!
Frigga: I'll never tell you.
Malekith: I believe you. [Algrim kills Frigga]


Loki: Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?
Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [Loki and the neat room turn to a destroyed room with Loki looking disheveled on the floor]
Loki: Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer? [referring to Frigga]
Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.
Loki: Go on.
Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.
Loki: [chuckles] You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?
Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.
Loki: Hm. When do we start?


[Jane meets Loki]
Jane: You're…
Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard—
[she hauls off and slaps him]
Jane: That was for New York!
Loki: [to Thor] I like her.
 . . .
Sif: Betray him, and I'll kill you.
Loki: Good to see you too, Sif.
 . . .
Volstagg: If you even think about betraying him…
Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.


Loki: You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant- [Thor shoves Loki out of the ship, and jumps out with Jane in his arms into a skiff piloted by Fandral]
Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!
Loki: [to Thor] You lied to me. I'm impressed.


Loki: [steering the skiff towards a tiny crevice in the mountain] If it were easy, everyone would do it.
Thor: Are you mad?
Loki: Possibly.


Thor: You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!
Loki: Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!
Thor: What good were you in your cell?
Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?!
Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [pins Loki and is about to hit him but lets him go] She wouldn't want us to fight.
Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.
Thor: [chuckles] I wish I could trust you.
Loki: [whispers] Trust my rage.


Thor: [holding a dying Loki] I will tell Father what you did here today.
Loki: I didn't do it for him.


[a flock of birds disappears into thin air, then reappears flying out of the ground near Ian, Darcy, and Dr. Selvig]
Darcy: What the hell was that? [to a grinning Dr. Selvig] Why are you smiling?
Dr. Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.


Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.
Thor: Not by your hand!
Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!


Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?
Thor: I've come to accept your surrender.
Malekith: You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!
Thor: But you can. [summons Mjolnir and deals the final blow to Malekith]


Odin: One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?
Thor: Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [offers the hammer]
Odin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.
Thor: I shall try to be.
Odin: I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.
Thor: I know. [turns to leave]
Odin: If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.
Thor: Thank you, Father. [leaves]
Loki: [appears from Odin's guise] No... thank you.


[mid credits scene; Sif and Volstagg arrive in an alien collection]
Carina: I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.
[the Collector, looking like an alien Liberace, appears and bows]
The Collector: Asgardians! It's an honor.
Sif: You know why we're here. [she hands him the Aether, which he accepts]
The Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?
Volstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.
The Collector: That's very wise. I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here in my collection.
Sif: See that it is.
[the Asgardians leave]
The Collector: One down…five to go."
